Kristin:​ Today we are so excited to have TWO, count them, two guests with
us on our show.
Jenny:​ Two?
Kristin:​ Two! Cameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher –
Jenny:​ Whoa
Kristin:​ Who are brilliant comedians, badass feminists, wives to each other.
You may know them from a wonderful show called “Take My Wife.”
Jenny:​ Mmm-hmm
Kristin:​ You may know them from a podcast called “Put Your Hands
Together.”
Jenny:​ Mmm-hmm
Kristin:​ You may know them just because they’re the best. And we’re going
to sit down with them and talk to them for the whole episode today.
Jenny:​ We are so pumped.
[THEME MUSIC]
Jenny:​ Hello and welcome to Buffering the Vampire Slayer, a podcast where
we’ll be watching and discussing every episode of ​Buffy the Vampire Slayer​,
one by one. I am Jenny Owen Youngs.
Kristin:​ And I’m Kristin Russo and this week we’re talking about Season 2,


Episode 2, “Some Assembly Required.” Stay tuned at the end of this podcast
every week for an original song written by us recapping the Buffy episode
that we’re discussing.
Jenny:​ “Some Assembly Required” was written by Ty King, directed by
Bruce Seth Green who is not Seth Green, he’s a whole other person, and
originally aired on September 22, 1997.
Kristin:​ This is the one where two science club nerds use body parts to
create the, quote, “perfect girlfriend” [Jenny laughs under Kristin] for a
teenager who has been brought back from the dead. I want everyone to
know that on the IMDb description there’s a tiny image, and the tiny image
is the picture from the inside of the locker that’s like all of the cut out pieces
of magazine body. That’s the image for this episode, so.
Jenny:​ If a ransom note was just a picture of a girl.
Kristin:​ [chuckles] yes. Yes, exactly.
Jenny:​ Wow.
Kristin:​ So, there’s a small, small dog sitting next to me, with his sweet,
little head, lying on my lap.
Jenny:​ What’s that dog wearing?
Kristin:​ A very beautiful Christmas sweater. A very nice Christmas sweater.
Um.
Jenny:​ Who’d that dog come with?
Kristin:​ The dog, right, did not come alone.
Jenny:​ He can’t drive.
Kristin:​ This dog’s name is Murph. Oh my gosh. He knows I’m talking about
him. He’s making little movements like he knows.
Jenny:​ Wow


Kristin:​ And Murph’s, Murph’s parents are, uh, Cameron Esposito and Rhea
Butcher who are here with us!
Cameron:​ Yay!
Jenny:​ Hooray!
Rhea:​ Yay!
Cameron:​ You guys, this is so fun already.
Rhea: ​He did drive us here though.
[Jenny and Kristin both laugh]
Rhea:​ He can’t drive alone.
Jenny:​ Does he have is permit, is that the deal?
Cameron:​ [Laughs] Yeah.
Kristin:​ Oh no, imagine a little license with Murph’s picture on it.
[Jenny laughs]
Cameron:​ Also, he’d have to have such a small car, it’s hard to figure out
how we would fit in it. [Kristin and Jenny both laugh]
[Rhea]:​ Yes
Cameron:​ I think maybe we were being towed behind. [Kristin and Jenny
both laugh]. Cause it’s a small car but it’s heavy so it’s got like good traction
–
Kristin:​ Right.
Cameron:​ And it can pull a decent –
Jenny:​ It’s the tugboat of cars


Kristin:​ Right, right. It’s the teeniest little car pulling the two of you, just in
two seats.
[All laughing]
Kristin:​ Ahh, well thanks for being here, guys!
Rhea:​ Thanks for having us.
Cameron:​ Oh ya know, it’s fun to have an excuse to hang out with pals!
Jenny:​ Yes!
Kristin:​ This is great. We almost didn’t make it to the taping of the actual
episode [Jenny laughs] ‘cause we just wanted to talk all night long.
Jenny: ​And also there was a hat on a dog situation.
Kristin and Rhea:​ Yeah
Rhea:​ Check my instagram for that.
[Kristin and Jenny laugh]
Cameron:​ You’re instagram! I took a picture!
Rhea: ​I took one too.
Cameron:​ Check out my instagram.
Kristin:​ Oh this is –
Rhea:​ I posted it faster.
Cameron:​ Oh no –
Kristin:​ Like, like a mirror.


Cameron:​ Wait, you already posted it?!
Rhea:​ Oh yeah.
[Kristin and Jenny both laugh]
Cameron:​ Rhea! Rhea!
Rhea:​ Cameron!
Cameron:​ I am so upset. I’m actually like genuinely upset, and probably, ya
know –
Rhea:​ Uh, it’s a big problem.
Kristin:​ We understand
Rhea:​ You can get another angle; you have more followers than I do.
Cameron:​ Yeah, that’s why I am supposed to
Kristin:​ Can I tell you something?
Cameron:​ Yes.
Kristin:​ Can I tell you something, Cameron?
Cameron:​ Yes, yes yes
Kristin:​ I – I often find that posting second is better, um, although
Instagram’s new algorithm is messing things up, but I find posting second is
better because people see it first.
Cameron:​ Oh Oooooo!
Kristin:​ Yeah
Cameron:​ I get it, yeah –


Kristin:​ ‘Cause it, yeah, it’s mmm hmm
Cameron:​ That’s right, you’re just copying me, Rhea!
[Kristin and Jenny laugh]
Cameron:​ In the future –
Rhea:​ As always.
Cameron:​ – In the future.
Kristin:​ So, this is really fun because, um, Cameron you are familiar with
the series.
Cameron:​ Yes I am
Kristin:​ However, Rhea, this is the first episode you’ve ever sat and
watched.
Rhea:​ It’s honestly the first time I’ve ever, from my recollection, that I’ve
sat down and watched an entire episode. I am aware of it. I know the
characters in it.
Kristin:​ Mmm hmm
Rhea: ​I’ve heard synopsis [sic] of many episodes –
[Kristin and Jenny laugh]
Rhea:​ – I’ve just literally never watched it.
Cameron:​ Was it from me though?
Kristin:​ I was gonna say, from Cameron?
Rhea:​ No, from multiple people
Cameron:​ Oh


Rhea:​ You and other people. My, uh –
Cameron:​ Mmm hmm, I’m just in a line of people
Rhea:​ – No. My maid of honor’s a huge Buffy fan. She was a huge Buffy
fan. In fact she lent me the box set and was like, “Look, you should watch
this. You’re probably not going to, but now you have no excuse. [laughs]
And then it just sat on my shelf until I went away to grad school.
Cameron:​ Well this show was really important to me when I was in high
school, even though it was really scary to me and I could barely watch it, I
still watched it because –
Rhea: ​[laughs] she’s scared of everything.
Cameron:​ – I liked special effects a lot. And there’s really cool special
effects makeup in this –
Kristin: ​Mmm hmm
Cameron:​ – and everything is practical effects because, like, computer
animation didn’t really exist –
Rhea:​ [laughs] – in 1997.
Cameron:​ And that’s really cool. I also love stunting –
Kristin:​ Uh huh
Cameron:​ – You know, people that are stuntin’ around and doing stunts.
Kristin:​ [laughs] stuntin’ around
Cameron:​ There are a lot of cool stunts in this television show. And there’s
also a lot of queerness throughout the whole thing.
Kristin:​ Yeah


Cameron:​ All characters. All characters, all situations. I think it’s one of the
first shows on television that really just showed non – traditional
relationships, whatever they might be. Yeah and so, that was kind of
awesome to me.
Kristin:​ So, so you watched this in high school but you haven’t seen it
since?
Cameron:​ I haven’t seen it since, and I will say watching this one episode,
like it’s so weird –
[Jenny laughs]
Cameron:​ – That they are children. Like it’s so weird that they are young
people.
Kristin:​ Correct, ‘cause they last time you watched it, they were you.
Cameron:​ They were... they were me/older, cause they playing High
Schoolers and I was really – You know in 1997 I was a freshman in high
school. September, I was – I mean I – I probably, wasn’t watching this
‘cause I was going to high school for the first time and losing my mind, and
so therefor not watching ​Buffy the Vampire Slayer​ for like a minute while I
lost my mind.
Jenny:​ Why were you losing your mind in high school? Was your school built
on top of a mystical convergence of evil? That would periodically open?
[Kristin laughs]
Cameron:​ Yeah, what was going on was there was like all these people kind
of escaping and they just had like different sorts of heads and sometimes
like, it’s like their brow would get very heavy at a certain time and then it
like this sorta tooth would come out.
[All laugh]
Cameron:​ No, for different reasons. I think that I was a small gay person
and I went to a really conservative Catholic High School and I was just


trying to figure out how to do anything.
Jenny:​ Did you feel like you had a secret identity that you couldn’t share
with your peers?
Cameron:​ Absolutely. Well, I didn’t know I was gay, but I did know that,
like, this show really meant something to me. I would watch this show with
my boyfriend, my boyfriend would watch this show with me. He was really
patient boyfriend.
Jenny:​ Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. Yes!
[Kristin laughs]
Cameron: ​This episode is also about, like, a high school football player.
Kristin:​ Which was your boyfriend?
Cameron:​ My boyfriend was a football player. And I did turn to Rhea during
the middle of the episode when they, when there’s a mom who rattles off
the stats of the football player. I’ll tell you when we get to that part in the
podcast, But –
[Kristin and Jenny laugh]
Cameron:​ – His stats are like, not that great.
Kristin:​ Wow!
Rhea:​ So funny what a perfect overlap of stuff that I’m not into or wasn’t
into in this episode. ‘Cause you were like very into this show; I wasn’t into
it, not on purpose, and then I hated football, so, there you go.
Jenny:​ Why? Like were there other, were you more into other sports at the
time?
Rhea:​ When I was in high school I was anti – sports. I was really into
basketball, like playing it, and then I quit the team, ‘cause I, for whatever
reason, was getting benched and I thought I was a better player on the


team. And so then I decided to go all – in in skateboarding, and was like
punk – rock and an artist.
Jenny:​ The other football.
Cameron:​ Here’s what’s going on: Rhea was like a bad – boy, and I was the
high school mascot. We were exactly opposite people. But I was really nice!
[Kristin & Jenny laugh]
Rhea:​ But I didn’t go to any games until my senior year because then I felt
“Ehh, I should maybe go to this.” But I just like wasn’t into it at all.
Cameron:​ And I planned every single dance. And decorated the –
Kristin:​ Also, were you actually the high school mascot?
Cameron:​ Yeah, I was.
Jenny:​ What?
Kristin:​ ‘Cause you, you said it, but I feel like if they’re listening, people
listening might think you were being –
Cameron:​ And I was a red – bird. I’m not being funny.
[Jenny laughs]
Cameron:​ I was a red – wing, which is a red bird. But then I also, like,
played –
Kristin:​ Wow.
Cameron:​ I was a three – sport athlete. I played – and I also like
decorated the gym for all the school dances and was like on student
government. I was the president of the spirit club –
Rhea:​ That’s weird


Cameron:​ – Which means that I ran the flag back and forth when my
boyfriend scored a touchdown. Like, you know the person that runs the giant
flag?
Jenny:​ No!
Kristin:​ Yeah right, no!
Jenny:​ [laughs] That is not…
Rhea:​ So wait, wait you ran the flag AND you were the mascot? Those are
two different jobs!
Cameron:​ Well the mascot didn’t always travel to away games.
Rhea:​ So, then you did because you had the flag? Oh my god.
Cameron:​ So then I was just myself. That’s right.
Jenny:​ But how could you be a three – sport athlete and also be the
mascot? Like did you have to do double duty?
Cameron:​ Friday night – You’re gay and you’re not having any sex so you
have so much time! You have so much time.
[All laugh]
Jenny:​ But like what is the actual time management of that? Does that
mean the mascot just doesn’t go to women’s sports. Is that the deal?
Cameron:​ Yeah, yes!
Jenny:​ ‘Cause that’d be silly.
Cameron:​ Wait. Wait! Jenny, what are you talking about? That’s your
confusion?
Jenny:​ I know, I know, I know. I dunno –


Cameron: ​The mascot doesn’t go to women’s sports!
Rhea:​ Jenny that’s a great question! No, it’s only for men’s basketball –
Jenny:​ Only for “real” sports.
Cameron & Rhea:​ – and football.
Rhea:​ The sports that people care about. Women’s basketball, which I
played, has no mascot.
Kristin:​ Wow!
Rhea:​ And sometimes the games are at 5pm!
[Kristin & Jenny laugh]
Kristin: ​Wow! Wow! Great stuff.
Rhea:​ On a Tuesday!
Cameron:​ Yeah, so I was –
Kristin:​ You know what it sounds like we’re talking about? The Patriarchy.
Rhea:​ It does!
Jenny: ​Ah! The Patriarchy! Oh, I had it marked for later.
Kristin:​ And it happens so easily.
Cameron:​ Well also I was swimmer during football season, right ‘cause they
both happen in the fall.
Rhea:​ And I don’t know how to swim.
Jenny:​ Wha – ?
Cameron:​ it’s true. She doesn’t know how to.


Rhea:​ Well I thought I did.
Jenny:​ That isn’t safe!
Kristin:​ Wow, you really are the inverse of each other.
Rhea:​ I thought I did but then we went on vacation with each other which
is, in all honesty, the first time I ever went on vacation [laughs]. And we
went to Palm Springs and we got in the pool and Cameron was like, “Oh,
sweetie, you don’t know how to swim.” [Cameron laughs.] And I was like [in
a southern drawl] “I thought I did!”
[Everyone laughs.]
Jenny: ​Oh no!
Rhea: ​I mean, I can kind of like – I don’t even know if you could call it a
dog paddle.
Kristin: ​But you can like stay afloat.
Rhea: ​Kind of, yeah. I don’t really like the deep end ‘cause I could drown.
Kristin: – ​well not with Cameron around! [Kristin and Rhea speak over each
other.]
Rhea: ​And one time Cameron – no!
Cameron: ​I was a lifeguard!
Kristin: ​Yeah!
Rhea: ​I started drowning in Hawaii and she was like, "oh, stop, you're not
drowning." [Jenny and Kristin laugh.] And I was like, "that's kind of the
definition of drowning, is – I can't stop it."


Cameron: ​No, no, no [under Rhea]. After the fact, she was like, [Rhea

laughs] "remember when I just drowned?" [Everyone laughs.] And I said,
"you didn't drown –
Jenny: ​If you drowned you'd be dead.
Cameron: – ​because. Yeah –
Kristin(?): ​Right.
Cameron: – ​we wouldn't be having this conversation.
Rhea: ​Oh, I did – that's not the bone you were picking –
Cameron: ​And she said I was saying, "I'm drowning! I'm drowning!"
[Laughs in background.] And I said, "right, which means you're not
drowning." [Cameron laughs.] 'Cause if you're drowning –
Kristin: ​[Laughs.] You're not saying –
Rhea: – ​sorry, I meant to call out, "I'm pre – drowning!" [Everyone laughs.]
"I'm pre – drowning!"

Kristin: ​"I am about to drown."
Rhea: "​I'm pre – drowning! I apologize – I didn't have the presence of mind
because I thought I was about to die.
[Everyone laughs.]
Rhea: ​[Laughing.] Because I cannot swim.
Kristin: ​[Laughing.] Ohhh.


[Cameron laughs.]
Kristin: ​I'm glad you survived.
Rhea: ​Me too! [Laughs.] Glad I lived to tell the tale.
[Cameron, Jenny and Kristin laugh.]
Kristin: ​So Rhea, what are your thoughts on your first episode of Buffy the
Vamp –

Rhea: ​On the episode?
Kristin: ​Yeah! I mean, how did it feel for you knowing nothing?
Rhea: ​I doubt it – yeah, I mean I thought it was really funny and it was

really enjoyable seeing all those clothes again. [Kristin groans in agreement.
Jenny laughs.] Man, were those some billowy shirts. [Laughs in the
background.] And like, unbuttoned so far down [Jenny laughs.] toply buttons
down
Kristin: ​Yeah. Angel went real far down with his buttons –
Rhea: ​Yeah.
Kristin: – ​in this episode. Also, I have a costume note for later in the

episode but since we're talking about dress, I'll bring it up now. [Cameron
laughs.] When they go to the football game – I don't know if anybody else
noticed Jenny Calendar's belt.
Rhea: ​Oh yeah. [Jenny gasps.]


Kristin: ​It was very special.
Rhea: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​I actually drew a picture in my notes.
Cameron: ​Oh, I would like to see the picture.
Kristin: – ​lest I forget.
Cameron: ​Yeah.
Rhea: ​It also looks like something you could maybe hang a plant with.
[Laughing in background.]
Kristin: ​This is not –
Rhea: ​That hangs from the ceiling in the 70s.
Cameron: ​Well, you know what though?
Kristin: ​This is my picture.
Cameron: – ​seeing. Oh yeah, totally.
Kristin: ​Yeah.
[Cameron and Kristin laugh.]
Kristin: ​Circles and lines.
Cameron: ​Well Rhea, it was fun to watch you laugh at it and I remembered
– 'cause before we watched, I was like, "it is really funny – like it is kind of


a comedy." And I was realizing that like before Gilmore Girls –
Rhea: – ​yeah.
Cameron: – ​this is the show that everybody talked about in terms of its
writing.

Jenny: ​Oh, yeah.
Cameron: ​Like it really set the stage for that. What was before this show?
Can you guys think of it? What would it have been before this?
Kristin: ​Like what was the big –
Rhea: ​Friends?
Kristin: ​No, Friends –
Cameron: ​No, because Friends doesn't really do that thing – the thing that

this show does so well that then people loved about Gilmore Girls is that half
the jokes are not delivered with any sort of weight and you're just supposed
to kind of keep –
Rhea: – ​keep up –
Cameron: – ​moving.
Jenny: ​Right, right, right, right.
Kristin: ​Yeah, they're almost like the transition between things.
Cameron: ​It was fun to watch that again.


Cameron and Rhea: ​Yeah.

Kristin: – ​the joke. It's like they say the joke and then they're like,
"anyway, onto the next thing."

Cameron: ​The camera doesn't even stay on them or whatever.
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Cameron: ​It's cool.
Jenny: ​When – what year did West Wing start?
Kristin: ​I don't know.
Cameron: ​Yeah, maybe. That's similar, yeah.
Rhea: ​Walk and talks –
Cameron: ​I have no idea when that started.
Rhea: ​I'm gonna stand by my friend's statement, that it's like a ensemble of
a bunch of people talking to each other, even though they're just in one
room (?). It's faster than a traditional multi – cam.
[Kristin laughs.]
Jenny: ​[Sarcastically] Oh yeah, faster than a traditional multi – cam, totally.
[Kristin and Rhea laugh.]
Jenny: ​Hard agree.
[Everyone laughs.]


Kristin: ​You guys know more about making TV than we do.
Rhea: ​I couldn't stop looking at the lighting.
Kristin: – ​well –
Rhea: ​There was something very early on, I was like, "her whole face is in
shadow – like all she has to do is lean forward [laughs] –
Jenny: ​Yo. There's a lot –
Rhea: ​[Laughing] I couldn't stop looking at that lighting!
Jenny: – ​there's a lot of that.
Rhea: ​Yeah.
Jenny: ​Like, it's definitely like in every episode.
Rhea: ​Yeah.
Jenny: ​And inconsistent – like nobody is getting – I don't know, maybe you
would know. I mean, things are just not consistently lit.
Rhea: ​Yeah.
Jenny: ​People are not consistently lit. People are in shadow. Also, this is
deliberate. That doesn't feel as deliberate, but like –
Rhea: ​Yeah.
Jenny: ​A lot of the time when you see Angel, it's through light that's coming


through Venetian ​[Kristin laughs.] or –
Kristin: – ​Venetian blinds.
Jenny: ​No, mini blinds.
Kristin: ​Yeah.
Jennie: ​Horizontal, like, tiny blinds. There's a lot of that!
Kristin: ​Someone wrote into us actually – we never said this on the show –
but somebody wrote into us 'cause we had a whole thing where we talked
about that Angel lighting that was just like –
Jenny: ​[Laughing] Right.
Kristin: – ​slatted lines of light and somebody wrote in and said, "I think

maybe that lighting decision was made because it shows the lightness and
the dark that is Angel.
Jenny: ​Wow.
Cameron: ​Oh my gosh.
Kristin: ​So.
Rhea: ​Yeah.
Jenny: ​Symbolic.
Cameron: ​That's really serious.
Kristin: ​There ya go. [Laughs.]


Cameron: ​Plus it's flattering on everybody. You know what I mean?
[Kristin laughs.]
Rhea: ​It's a good look – slatted lighting.
Cameron: ​It's a good look – it's flattering on everybody.
Rhea: ​Looks good on everybody.
Cameron: ​Well, they also did so many night shoots on this show. I don't
know – they're not in a sound stage –
Rhea: – ​yeah, but that's a set.
Cameron: – ​can I ask you a question? Are they in a soundstage that looks
like a cemetery and it's also –
Rhea: ​It's very possible.
Cameron: ​Is that what you think?
Rhea: ​Yeah.
Jenny: ​I think after season one –
Cameron: – ​I agree with you too.
Rhea: ​Yeah.
Jenny: – ​they built a sound stage cemetery.


Cameron: ​So everything – nothing is practically shot. Nothing is like out –
Rhea: ​I mean the football thing was.
Jenny and Cameron: ​Yeah.
Jenny: ​And externals of the high school – that's Torrance High School.
Rhea: ​Yeah.
Cameron: ​Mmm.
Rhea: ​So they would have to do those night shoots, but I feel like – yeah.
Cameron: ​They must have had a crazy schedule. Anyway, we can keep

going, but it's crazy to watch this show. ​[Kristin and Jenny laugh.] ​This is like a
really intense operation –

Rhea: ​We can't stop thinking about, "Oh my god – how did they block shoot
this?"

Cameron: ​How did they make it?!
[Rhea laughs.]
Kristin: ​Well, at one point, I think you Rhea were like, "Well it must have
cost so much to shoot this scene.
Rhea: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​And I was like, "sure, yeah."
Rhea: ​Do you know how much those extras cost? I mean, and to make


them play football? [Jenny hums in agreement.] Like that's a lot of insurance
to have those guys playing football.
Kristin: ​Yeah. It was cool to like have your minds though in that sense

'cause I just watched it and was like, "right, and now they play football."
[Cameron and Rhea laugh.] Like it doesn't occur to me that that would cost
a lot – of money.
Cameron: ​Of course!
Kristin: – ​of money. So Cameron, this episode scared you. I'm sorry that
you got scared.

Cameron: ​Well, I just found it was real spooky and creepy.
Rhea: ​She gets scared by like piano music.
[Kristin bursts into laughter. Jenny laughs.]
Cameron: ​That's true. I got less scared later but my number one biggest
fear is – in television and film – is when something comes up behind and
that happened ​two​ very solid times in this show.
Kristin: ​Yeah.
Cameron: ​Where it's like super slow. Like a slow, intense –
Kristin: – ​and it does like the camera coming up behind and you know
something –
Cameron: – ​dislike. Do not like it. [Everyone laughs.] Super spooked.
Kristin: ​Well, we learn, I mean the opening scene of this we learn that Buffy
knows how to yo – yo, which –
Rhea: – ​yeah –


Kristin: – ​I felt was an important point to bring up.
Rhea: ​It also was like, oh, that's what we did when we didn't have phones.
Kristin: ​Ri – [giggles.]
Jenny: ​Yeahhh.
Rhea: ​We yo – yo – ed. [Everyone laughing.] On gravestones.
Jenny: ​I yo – yo – ed. Well maybe not on a gravestone.
Kristin: ​Did you yo – yo?
Jenny: ​Yeah for sure.
Kristin: ​Could you, like, actually yo – yo?
Jenny: ​I could do, like, a few tricks.
Kristin: ​Wow.
Rhea: ​Did you do cat's cradle or what? [Kristin laughs.]
Jenny: ​Yeah! Cat's cradle, 'round the world, I walked the dog. [everyone
makes impressed noises]
Rhea: ​Really? I always thought I could walk the dog but I was just throwing
it on the ground [kristin laughs.]
Jenny:​ I was excited if I got it to come back up. That was my yo – yo – ing
abilities in high school. I did have a yo – I mean, people fucking had yo –
yos. [everyone affirms] Just keep it in your backpack with your hacky sack!
Rhea: ​That was, I mean, you’d buy it and be like ‘is this going to be the
thing that people remember me for?’ [laughter] Nah, that’s not it. Just like
headphones,
Cameron:​ Harmonica.
Rhea: ​[continuing] that used to be a thing that was like characteristic, but
now, like everybody wears them. [Jenny and Kristin agree]
Cameron:​ I also will say that in that opening shot I was immediately struck


by, um, Sarah – Michelle Gellar’s bod, because she has like a really short
skirt on, and she looks like a human woman, and I just wanna point out that
sometimes when you watch television now, uh, some bods have gotten so
toned up that some teens look like they’re thirty – five and have like really
specific personal training regimens, [Kristin laughs] and it’s like really
interesting to see her in this show, ‘cause she obviously is like beautiful and
a TV star, but she also looks kind of… [says hesitantly] normal.
Kristin: ​Yeah, and I think a lot of the characters in the show, I mean, in the
90’s, you could be more of a person on television.
Cameron: ​Mm – hm. For sure. And I mean, it’s cool to see it. Like Willow is
like standing sideways at one point, and you realize that she’s like pretty flat
– chested, ‘cause she’s like a really young woman, who – and like, they
didn’t make her wear, a really bonkers bra –
Rhea: ​A boob set. Or something. [Cameron laughs] [Rhea imitating a
director] ‘Here, put on these boobs.’
Kristin: ​[incredulous] you guys, is that a thing that happens, here in
hollywood?
Cameron:​ Well, I feel like I don’t know, but I feel like, right? When you’re
watching TV right now, do people look like that to you guys?
Rhea:​ I don’t think so.
Jenny:​ What? Sorry, Murph moved.
Kristin:​ No, on TV? Absolutely not.
Cameron:​ I feel like it’s a deliberate choice. It’s like, you could find it on
cool cable shows, or streaming shows, there’s different types of bodies, and
that’s very, like, leaned into, [Jenny agreeing] but on like a network show…
anyway.
Kristin: ​Also, I had a note about her skirt, because she’s doing serious
fighting.
Rhea:​ Yeah, and she has platform sandals on! Like two – inch platform
sandals on.
Jenny: ​Those sandals are highly impractical for slaying.
Cameron: ​But she never really cares about that. Guys?


Jenny: ​She doesn’t even have to think about it! [everyone agreeing] She
does, I feel like she does check her skirt after she falls into the open grave,
to like make sure that she has landed… safely?
Kristin: ​Just to check it off our list, ‘cause last week we were like ‘hey
there’s new stuff in the credits’, this is the moment where she –
Jenny:​ Where she pops her head back up.
Kristin:​ – where she pops her head out of the grave comes from episode 2,
we just saw​ it for the first time.
Cameron:​ Oh, it’s pretty great.
Kristin:​ And then we go to the credits.
Jenny:​ You don’t want to talk about how Buffy and Angel got in a big fight
about Xander.
Kristin:​ Oh yeah right.
Jenny:​ I know you’re over this but at least for later resolution.
Kristin:​ We were like half way done writing the song and Jenny keeps trying
to put lyrics in about Angel and Buffy and their tension and I’m like ehh it
doesn’t matter, it’s not a thing.
Cameron:​ I’m invested in their tension as well.
Jenny:​ Thank you.
Cameron:​ But also I will say, this dang show and every other dang show
that had so many high school characters, I know Angel’s not high school
age, had so many characters that are mad at each other for talking to other
people. [Jenny laughs] Is that something that actually happens to anybody?
Jenny:​ Well what happened in the last episode actually–
Cameron: ​They danced up on each other?
Jenny: ​so Buffy died.


Cameron: ​Uhuh yes.
Kristin:​ That was two episodes ago.
Jenny:​ That was two episodes ago, and then she got CPRed and came back
to life and defeated the Master who was the head vampire in last season.
She came back after summer vacation with a lot of unresolved trauma and
she was acting out a lot and one of the ways she acted out was to do a very
sexy dance with Xander at the Bronze while Cibo Matto played “Sugar
Water” and Angel looked on in a huff.
Kristin: ​Yeah, so we’re just coming off of the huff.
Cameron:​ Ok, so like nothing happened except for sexy dancing?
Kristin:​ Nothing happened, just a sexy dance.
Jenny: ​Yeah but like deliberately cruel sexy dancing.
Kristin: ​I think that Angel needs to take a deep breath.
Jenny:​ Well he is–
Jenny and Cameron: ​he’s 241.
Kristin:​ Exactly.
Cameron: ​I think maybe, I don’t know, pull her aside and have a real
conversation. [group laughter and agreement]
Rhea:​ If fun sexy dancing pisses you off what have you been doing for 241
years? What other experiences have you had that that can still bother you?
Jenny: ​The bulk of his experiences have been… pillaging, like a lot of
slaughter, and then after he was re – ensouled he’s been working through
his own trauma, recovering from the fact that he now cares about every life
that he took.
Rhea:​ Ugh, he has to have feelings about it.
Jenny:​ I know, I know.


Kristin: ​This is the first time we actually learned how old Angel was, right?
Jenny:​ I think so, I think this is the day.
Kristin:​ 241.
Rhea:​ Question. How do you talk to an Angel? [group laughter]
Kristin:​ Wow, that’s a 90’s crossover.
Rhea:​ Can you hold her close?
Kristin:​ That’s a crossover episode.
Jenny:​ Oh! The 90210 high school also–
Kristin:​ Is that high school
Jenny: ​Torrance High School.
Rhea:​ No way! [laughter]
Kristin:​ Yes!
Rhea:​ I thought it felt… similar. It felt familiar
Kristin:​ Same exact high school.
Kristin:​ I have written down a thing that I don’t remember what I wrote it
for but I just wrote “Jenny Calendar…” Oh! [remembering why she wrote it]
“flirt practice” We see Giles –
Jenny:​ Yeah yeah, Giles is practicing on a chair.
Kristin:​ Practicing flirting.
Rhea:​ It’s all very Clint Eastwood [laughter].
Cameron:​ Mhm, I was going to make the same joke, but I waited for you to
make it.


Kristin: ​That was so nice.
Jenny: ​You can make it later, and people will see it in their feed first.
Cameron:​ That’s right.
Kristin:​ But I just wonder, because I know that Giles is not just the teacher,
he’s the watcher, and they have a deeper relationship with him, but I was
very confused about the way that Buffy and Xander and all of them
interacted with Giles having a crush on Jenny Calendar. I just feel like I
would never have a conversation like that with my teacher or my watcher.
You know what I mean?
Jenny: ​Or my watcher [laughter].
Rhea: ​I’ve literally never had that conversation with somebody that’s older
than me.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Cameron:​ So, is part of their dynamic supposed to be that he’s in charge of
all the practical stuff but he doesn’t have any of the intangibles.
Kristin: ​Yes.
Cameron: ​Right, that’s what the Scooby gang does, is that they are like
[Cam being a Scooby] “this is the other stuff that you should care about, like
food and washing your body”
Jenny:​ Food, computer hacking.
Rhea:​ [laughing] Washing your body?
Jenny:​ Nobody’s washed their bodies yet that we’ve seen.
Rhea:​ Is that the lesson we’ve learned from Scooby Doo? “Hey gang, don’t
forget to take a shower?” [laughter]
Cameron:​ So that’s why they’re comfortable doing it, that’s their dynamic.
Jenny:​ They’re spending all their time together.


Kristin:​ I know, I still felt embarrassed about the whole thing.
Cameron:​ Well was it because the advice was bad?
Kristin:​ No, I think it was because Giles was so embarrassed, who I love by
the way. I love Giles’ crush on Jenny Calendar.
Jenny:​ Yeah yeah yeah, peak Giles.
Kristin:​ Ahh, so fumble – y.
Jenny:​ Foppish.
Rhea:​ High – key Giles.
Kristin:​ Dropping all the papers off the table.
Rhea:​ [impersonating Giles] Wh – wh – wha – what was that? [laughter]
Did you say second, second date? [more laughter]
Cameron:​ What has he done since then? Anthony Michael Head?
Kristin:​ Anthony Stewart Head. Anthony Michael Hall.
Cameron:​ I got the Anthony and the Head.
Rhea:​ C Thomas Howell.
Kristin:​ Anthony Michael Stewart Head.
Cameron:​ What has he done since this?
Jenny:​ Great question.
Kristin:​ We know he did a Taster’s Choice commercial before. [people
agreeing]
Rhea: ​Yeah, I was gonna say that’s what he got picked up from, right? That


Taster’s Choice –
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Rhea:​ Series.
Kristin:​ Are you looking it up… what he’s done since?
Cameron:​ I just trust him so much, and I really [laughter] I trust him so
much.
Rhea: ​I don’t why that’s so funny to me.
Jenny: ​He has the vibe.
Rhea:​ I’d give him my Taster’s Choice anytime.
Jenny:​ That’s sweet.
Kristin:​ He’s very dad – ly, you know? [agreement] He’s very calming. Well,
while you look up Giles’ trajectory –
Jenny:​ Oh my god, he’s in Imagine Me and You –
Kristin:​ What?!
Jenny:​ The other movie where Piper Perabo kisses a girl.
Cameron:​ Oh yeah he is, he’s her dad!
Rhea:​ Ohhh!
Cameron:​ I knew that I had seen him in something.
Jenny:​ Oh my god! Where Piper Perabo kisses Cersei Lannister!
Kristin:​ Whoa!
Jenny:​ That’s what happens in that movie, and Giles is Cersei Lannister’s


dad?
Kristin:​ Uh, yeah.
Cameron:​ Did you forget that? Yes that’s true.
Kristin:​ I forgot it. We have to rewatch this film.
Rhea:​ And she dumps Ozymandias –
Kristin:​ Spoiler alert for those of you who haven’t seen Imagine Me and You
Rhea:​ For Cersei Lannister. How old is that movie? It’s 20 years old now?
Jenny:​ 2005?
Rhea: ​Yeah, 20 years old.
Kristin:​ But everyday a new lesbian is born.
Jenny:​ Aww.
Kristin: ​They’re just catching up, they have a lot to watch.
Cameron:​ That’s true, we only get like 5 movies [laughter]. Rhea don’t say
which lesbian leaves a guy to be with a woman, in which movie, just know
that it happens in all of them.
Rhea:​ I feel like it’s pretty obvious that the comedy that’s rated PG, Imagine
Me and You, is gonna end up happy, anyway.
Kristin:​ So wait, where are we even [in the episode]?
Jenny:​ Giles is practicing on a chair.
Kristin:​ Giles is practicing on a chair, and then Cordelia enters.
Jenny: ​Right.


Kristin:​ I mean like, whatever, they have their Giles thing, but then we go
to the Science Fair.
Jenny:​ Right right right, and she’s all tomato: fruit or vegetable?
Kristin:​ Right.
Jenny:​ Great question.
Kristin:​ Great question. Also Cordelia and Willow are kind of wearing the
same outfit, but in the Cordelia shape and the Willow shape.
Jenny:​ That I missed, what did it look like?
Kristin:​ It’s just the patterns of Willow’s shirt and Cordelia’s dress are
almost identical but it’s a flowy lady dress and a nerdy collared button down.
Jenny:​ Oh! And they both look like 70’s wallpaper?
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ Right right right.
Kristin:​ Very 70’s wallpaper.
Cameron:​ That’s true. I was very happy to see Willow show up because I
had a huge thing for her in high school and I remember going and asking for
her hair cut. Then seeing it now I realize that she doesn’t have a hair cut.
[laughter]
Kristin:​ Yeah she just has hair.
Jenny:​ You were asking for something else but you didn’t know how to ask
for it so you just said hair cut. [more laughter]
Cameron: ​[reenacting the request] Can you give me Willow’s hair cut? [as
the stylist] What does it look like? [as herself again] It goes straight down.
Kristin:​ It does nothing.


Cameron:​ It goes straight down and it’s hair.
Rhea:​ It’s the length that my hair currently is.
Kristin:​ It is very shiny though.
Rhea:​ Herbal Essences probably. [people agree]
Jenny:​ Yeah that’s some shampoo commercial hair.
Kristin:​ She pre-dates Herbal Essences – Herbal Essence, or Herbal
Essences?
Cameron:​ Herbals Essence.
Jenny:​ [gasps] Remember how their ad campaign was just people having
shower-gasms?
Kristin:​ Yeah, their just orgasms.
Jenny:​ Female pleasure.
Rhea:​ It’s back!
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ It’s back?
Rhea:​ No, the shampoo is back.
Kristin:​ Not the –
Rhea:​ Not the orgasms.
Kristin:​ Of course.
Jenny:​ Never!


Kristin:​ Dammit!
Rhea:​ Yeah, it’s back, in grocery stores.
Kristin:​ We had that one brief moment.
Rhea:​ It was a good two years [laughter].
Kristin:​ So ok, they’re at the Science Fair, and then creepy Eric comes with
his camera.
Jenny:​ [sound of disgust]
Kristin: ​Yeah it’s so creepy though.
Jenny:​ Yeah he’s really gross.
Kristin:​ I know that shit gets creepier.
Jenny:​ The wink in particular.
Rhea:​ That kid was in a lot of stuff.
Kristin:​ Really?
Cameron:​ He was.
Jenny: ​Really, what else was he in?
Rhea:​ I don’t know.
Jenny:​ Was he creepy in everything?
Cameron:​ I mean definitely.
Rhea:​ He was in Boy Meets World or something.
Cameron:​ That… uh… situation of him showing up and just taking pictures
of women without their permission is such a funny –


Kristin:​ Right
Cameron:​ I can’t tell if the show was trying to comment on it, moment, or
they were like it’s fine he’s harmless, and I’m like no!
Kristin:​ Because it was the second time that we had watched the episode
and I knew what was coming next. I knew that these were the guys that
were totally violating lots of women –
Cameron:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ All the time. I was like, this seems super intentional and kind of
cool. I feel like they went out of their way to show that Cordelia and Willow
and Buffy were like “What the fuck, dude. Nobody said you could take our
fucking picture.”
Cameron:​ That’s true.
Kristin:​ It’s a whole thing.
Rhea: ​He was in Free Willy and the Wonder Years. He was also in Inglorious
Bastards.
Kristin:​ Wow. The Wonder Years, I loved that show. Um speaking of, are we
allowed to say ‘The Patriarchy’ more than once?
Jenny:​ I think we might be able to say to say it four times.
Kristin:​ Oh! Cause there’s four of us.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ I’ve taken two already, but that one didn’t count. This is the second
one.
Rhea:​ That was a question, yeah.
Kristin:​ I was asking.


Cameron:​ Murph is asleep nose down.
Kristin:​ Murrrrph.
Rhea:​ He is into the chair.
Cameron:​ He is passed out, face first on the chair. Anyway, keep going I
just wanted to make sure to tell you about that.
Kristin:​ We’ll make sure to show you pictures. It’s been well documented.
Every time I say anything everyone else in the room just continues to take
Murph and my picture [laughter]. Um so I think new patriarchy moment
here is we go to the graveyard, and I just want to know what everyone
thinks about this, because it’s Buffy and Willow and they’re just sitting by
the grave and Giles and Xander are digging the grave. Xander’s like “the
femmes could pick up a shovel and help us out here” or whatever. So on the
one hand the scene is set up where the women are doing nothing and the
men are digging. But on the other hand Buffy is like “sorry, this is the role of
women, you wanted it this way, so here I fucking sit.” So I’m just
wondering, thoughts from the group on if this is upending or doing bad
things.
Cameron:​ I have a very hard time being that offended by almost anything
in this show. Only because I’ve seen so much of it and I know the intention
of the whole thing, especially at the time.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Cameron:​ Just the idea that they were putting a woman kicking people in
the face on television [laughter]. I mean Xena was on at the same time I
think, so there were a couple of shows were it was like women are kicking
faces. [laughter] What’s especially great about this show is that there’s no
victim because literally the vampires disappear after she stakes them in the
heart. It’s very satisfying and there’s no sadness to be had because they’re
terrible demons. Yeah, I didn’t have a problem with it. Usually I’m extremely
hyper – vigilant and have a problem with everything.
Kristin:​ Well but there’s that other end of it, you know? If you’re saying I’m


gonna sit here and do my nails cause that’s what you said I was gonna do,
now you shovel the grave. You know what I mean?
Cameron:​ And it’s the way she’s saying it too, and her delivery, and how
much you know she really does do for the whole team.
Kristin:​ Exactly!
Jenny:​ Yeah, also if the point of feminism is to create the space in women’s
lives to choose what they want to do, and a big part of that recently is it’s
also a woman’s choice if she doesn’t want to work. There’s probably a better
way to say all that, but feminism here is doing the work to make space for
Buffy to make the choice of whether or not she participates in exhuming a
potential body.
Kristin:​ Right. And then she jumps in and is the only one who will open the
casket anyway.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ So, there’s that.
Jenny:​ Yo! So then, Cordelia’s in the parking lot and listen, we have to talk
about it! Ok because first of all she’s like we really have to practice our
cheer, otherwise no one’s gonna be lead by them at the game. And listen,
you weren’t here for Season 1, Episode 3 when we first met the Sunnydale
Cheerleaders but their only cheer is “Go Sunnydale Go, Go Sunnydale Go,
Go Sunnydale Go, 678” repeat.
Kristin:​ They say “678.”
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Rhea: ​Wow.
Jenny:​ And that cheer appears here. I think they say Razorbacks now
instead of Sunnydale.
Kristin: ​They accidentally say Greenbacks, actually—


Jenny:​ Which is a real mystery
Kristin:​ Which is weird.
Jenny:​ Within this universe they’re supposed to be saying Razorbacks, and
we hear it later at the football game.
Rhea:​ Go Dollar-bills Go! [laughter]
Kristin:​ Here’s the thing, I want to talk about the cheers too, but I also
want to just know for a second, how many people in this room had those
sneakers that Cordelia was wearing. They were the while Adidas sneakers
with the three stripes on the side.
Cameron:​ I didn’t have them but of course, you know –
Rhea:​ Were they Shell Toes?
Kristin:​ The Shell Toes.
Rhea:​ Oh yeah I had a pair of Shell Toes in high school.
Cameron:​ I feel like you still have some.
Rhea:​ I don’t have any Shell Toes, get out of here with that.
Cameron:​ I think she’s got some.
Rhea:​ I don’t own a pair of Shell Toes.
Cameron:​ No, yeah she does.
Rhea:​ I can’t stand them.
Kristin:​ Jenny had a pair of Shell Toes that she did not wear forever and I
finally, finally let them go.
Jenny:​ RIP


Kristin:​ But like very recently.
Cameron:​ Oh man.
Kristin:​ [to Cam]You didn’t have Shell Toes?
Rhea:​ I can’t wear Shell Toes.
Kristin:​ That surprises me.
Cameron:​ No… no, I wore like Steve Maddens.
Jenny​: Sambas if anything.
Cameron:​ Oh I did wear Sambas. [laughter]
Jenny:​ Yeah, of course you did.
Rhea:​ Of course you wore Sambas.
Kristin:​ Sambas are basically related, they’re in the same family.
Cameron:​ That’s great. That’s a great… pull
Kristin:​ You’re were like “I would never wear Shell Toes! Oh I totally had
Sambas, yeah.” [laughter]
Jenny: ​That was a different thing! They were built for speed.
Cameron:​ I also had Docs, you guys, Docs. When I was a freshman I had
platform Steve Martin loafers –
Kristin:​ Steve Martin! By the way
Cameron:​ I also wore knee socks and a skirt everyday to school. By the
time I was a senior I wore white steel toed platform lace-up Doc Martens –
Rhea:​ Which you still have.


Cameron:​ That were like illegal.
Jenny:​ Illegal. Illegal in Catholic school.
Kristin:​ They were illegal a your school?
Cameron:​ Not dress code. [laughter]
Kristin:​ Um I just want to make sure that you know that you said Steve
Martin and not Steve Madden.
Cameron:​ I wore Steve Martin’s shoes. [laughter]
Jenny:​ They were verbosely oversized.
Cameron:​ No, I did say Steve Martin, you’re right. Because that’s how long
it’s been since I’ve worn any of those shoes. I forgot what they’re called and
I thought they were a movie star.
Kristin:​ I want everyone to see some pictures of you in that phase of time.
Cameron: It’s the best.
Kristin: ​You know? It’s really special.
Cameron:​ It’s the best, it’s the best.
Jenny:​ Yeah, do you have any? I’ve only seen you as a business woman in
your teens.
Cameron: ​I was a business woman. I’ve got so many great photos. I have
to go do an expedition to my parents house and come back with some stuff.
[agreement]
Rhea: ​I gotta get mine too and we’ve gotta get our high school pictures
together. You say all the time that we would have dated each other, but…
Cameron:​ Do you mean get our pictures together like take one picture of
you, one picture of me put them on top of each other, rub ‘em back and


forth? [laughter]
Rhea:​ Yeah that’s what I mean.
Kristin:​ And go like [kiss noise].
Jenny:​ See what your baby would look like.
Rhea: ​Of course that’s what I mean.
Cameron:​ Wham, wham wham! [laughter]
Rhea:​ Wham, wham, wham, that’s what I mean, yeah. [more laughter]
Kristin:​ Ok, so Cordelia in her Shell Tops hides in the dumpster because
she’s afraid. It turns out that it’s just Angel who thinks that it’s Buffy that he
saw, which is weird.
Cameron:​ Why is he even there?
Jenny:​ He seems like he is lying.
Cameron:​ Also, I don’t remember, how does Buffy meet Angel?
Kristin:​ He just appears. He just follows her one day down an alley.
Jenny:​ And gives her a cross necklace.
Kristin:​ And he’s like “Uhh the Hellmouth is a thing.” What is it?
Jenny:​ The Harvest.
Kristin:​ Oh, the Harvest.
Cameron:​ What is he supposed to do?
Kristin: ​He –
Cameron:​ He just pops up?


Kristin:​ He’s fighting.
Jenny:​ He’s fighting for good.
Cameron:​ Ok.
Rhea:​ He’s on Bones.
Jenny:​ He’s trying to atone for a couple hundred years of killing people.
Cameron:​ Right, but the reason he’d be at the high school is there’s no
reason?
Jenny:​ Well it’s were the Hellmouth is.
Cameron:​ Sure, fair point. Ok got it.
Kristin:​ So he’s sticking around to help sleuth. He usually guides Buffy,
from what we’ve seen so far. He’ll be like “hey this thing is happening, just
so you know they’re gathering, so heads up on that.”
Jenny:​ Yeah yeah yeah, a lot of that.
Cameron:​ Also, I said it as we were watching, but his haircut.
Jenny:​ Yes.
Cameron:​ Is his last name Boreatus? Is that how you say it?
Jenny:​ Boreanaz.
Cameron:​ Boreanaz. David Boreanaz. His haircut is… why is that his
haircut?
Rhea:​ Also only he could have that haircut.
Cameron:​ How did it happen?


Rhea:​ It’s very specific to his specific head.
Cameron:​ It’s going down and up and it meets in the middle as sort of a
crest. [laughter]
Rhea:​ I think it’s all he can do. [more laughter]
Cameron:​ I do not believe it.
Rhea:​ I think he’s like an owl-man.
Cameron:​ It doesn’t look that wild on Bones, it looks kinda normal.
Rhea:​ What are you talking about that’s exactly what it looks like.
Cameron:​ His hair still looks like that?
Rhea:​ Yeah.
Cameron:​ Really? It goes down and up?
Jenny:​ I feel like it’s shorter and more adult than it was on Buffy.
Kristin:​ Jenny has a theory on why his hair looks like this.
Jenny:​ I mean in the universe of the show, my theory is he’s a vampire he
can’t see his reflection so he’s trying something but he has no way of
knowing what the result is.
Cameron:​ Do you know what’s really funny about that is I think I always
thought that a vampire can’t see their reflection but they can just see hair
Jenny:​ [laughing] Whaaat!
Kristin:​ Like their skin they can’t see but their hair is an extension of
themselves.
Rhea: ​Just their floating hair.


Jenny:​ Whyyy? What is the logic?
Kristin:​ Did you just realize that was your thought?
Cameron:​ Yeah and I think it’s really funny.
Jenny: ​Oh. My God.
Cameron:​ Imagine a little funny haircut. And then I guess the question is
can you see right through?
Kristin:​ Also wouldn’t you be able to see your clothing… in your reflection?
Rhea:​ Like the Hollow Man.
Cameron:​ That’s what I think. You can see the clothes and the hair.
Jenny:​ How does it become invisible –
Kristin:​ When it touches you? That doesn’t make any sense.
Jenny:​ Ok, I see where you’re at… but we can’t know, I think is the thing.
Kristin:​ Yeah there’s no answer. But just posting a question to the masses,
yeah? The two of you, the way your faces look when Murph does something
you like is the sweetest thing.
Cameron: ​I just don’t know where he’s going.
Kristin:​ The proudest parents in all the land.
Jenny:​ He’s got a lot of exploring to do. And now he’s gonna lay down
again.
Rhea:​ He had to go check it out.
Kristin:​ Murph just wanted to make sure this was the best seat in the
house.


Rhea:​ Is this the warmest place? Yes it is.
Kristin:​ It is.
Rhea:​ I’m back, he’s back.
Kristin:​ Ok, listen, should I even keep going through my points?
Cameron: ​Yes!
Kristin:​ Should I?
Cameron:​ You’re the guiding light we need.
Kristin:​ Oh boy.
Jenny:​ Well like, can we just talk about his dumb face when he pops up,
when she’s coming out of the dumpster?
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny: ​What is the direction? He’s got this big goofy smile on his face on
the side shot –
Kristin:​ I don’t know.
Jenny:​ And then when the camera’s directly facing him, he’s still kind of
smiling in this friendly way that doesn’t make any sense and he’s answering
Cordelia’s questions about why he was following her in a very obtuse way.
Kristin:​ Maybe it’s because Cordelia is so pretty.
Cameron: ​That’s a great point.
Jenny:​ That is a solid point.
Cameron:​ Also the men in this show are giant –
Kristin: ​So big.


Cameron:​ Compared to the women.
Jenny: ​Sarah Michelle Gellar is what, like 5 feet tall?
Cameron: ​I’d guess that she’s super small, I mean, I don’t know.
Jenny:​ Last time I measured her, she was 5 feet.
Cameron:​ Also all of the dudes that are in this specific –
Jenny:​ Are all 6 feet.
Cameron:​ They’re enormous. They’re so big.
Kristin:​ I mean Xander and Angel are huge. And then of course the zombie
dude is also huge.
Cameron:​ Even Giles is pretty big. It looks like a Disney movie. Like Moana,
where Moana is so teeny then Maui, the character that is played by The
Rock, is 8 times her size. And then you’re like “I feel like in real life men and
women are kind of similar sizes.” [laughter] Not in this universe either.
Kristin:​ No they’re huge. Jenny was talking last week too about how even
though Angel is huge and Xander is huge that when Angel is with Buffy it
seems to look more proportionate. And when Xander and Buffy stand next to
each other –
Jenny:​ Like when they’re doing a sexy dance together for example.
Kristin:​ Yeah maybe that’s why it looks so awkward.
Jenny:​ It just looks wrong. He looks like a bean.
Kristin:​ Um I would like to give a special shout out to Cordelia for her
scream. She has a few in the episode.
Jenny:​ The dumpster one is a real winner.


Kristin:​ Actually if I’m gonna rank her screams I think that the scream
where she’s on the table and she’s like “I promise not to scream” and then
she screams, actually wins out for me in my horror scream ranking. But she
gets her first really good scream in the dumpster and it’s paired with a big
motion. I know you couldn’t see that audience but I was moving my hands
to the side of my face [laughter]. But yeah Cordelia gets a good scream and
there’s gonna be a lot of moments for this but we have a lot to talk about so
I want to make sure that we show our love for Cordelia.
Cameron:​ That’s a great point.
Jenny:​ Now is the time.
Kristin:​ Now is the time.
[Cordelia jingle plays]
Cordelia (ah – ahh​)
I love you, Cordelia (ah – ahh)
You’re perfect, Cordelia (ahh – ahhh)
Kristin:​ Great! Great, great, great. Alright, what do you got Jenny?
Jenny: ​What do I have? I’m so glad you asked. We go to the library just
after Angel has pulled Cordelia and a bunch of body parts out of a dumpster,
right?
Kristin:​ Mmhm.
Jenny: ​And this is, I think, where we have to – we have no choice but to
award the sexual tension trophy to Angel and Xander because they’re all
“Angel.” “Xander.” “Angel.”
Kristin:​ Right, they have a Rocky Horror Picture Show moment. [laughter]
Jenny:​ Exactly!
Kristin:​ Alright, yeah.
Jenny:​ So if you’re comfortable with that I’d really like to give it to them.


Kristin:​ Okay, I had written down the obvious answer which was Giles and
Jenny Calendar –
Jenny:​ No, no, no, no, no.
Kristin:​ But I defer to your – yes.
Jenny:​ Second place, second place. So maybe Angel can pawn the trophy
we just gave him and buy a new jacket because that jacket is all wrong for
his coloring.
Kristin:​ That jacket is horrible!
Jenny:​ It’s…not right. It’s really washing him out.
Kristin:​ Are they trying to signal spring? Like is that – what season are we
in?
Rhea:​ I don’t know. There’s a lot of white.
Jenny:​ Or maybe because he’s paired with Cordelia, they’re trying to make
him look more… mainstream
Cameron:​ But if he’s gonna get a new jacket can he bring Xander? Because
Xander needs smaller clothes.
Kristin:​ Xander needs –
Rhea:​ He needs to go down a size.
Jenny:​ Xander’s clothes are huge but do you remember the 90’s?
Cameron:​ I know but it’s so funny to see it now.
Rhea:​ Xander is basically who I’m talking about when I’m like, the clothes
are huge. It’s like a lot and then he’s putting a messenger bag on top of it.
Jenny:​ Oh yeah!


Kristin:​ That is the classic look.
Rhea: ​And it’s just like, cinched across his chest.
Cameron:​ I feel like you wore your clothes proportionately to you the same
size to him.
Rhea:​ No. Not in high school.
Kristin: ​Did you have a messenger bag?
Rhea:​ I did before that. Yeah, before that. In high school, I tried to and I
was like, I don’t care about school, why do I have a bag?
Kristin:​ Right.
[laughter]
Cameron:​ [amused] What? Rhea, this is crazy thing to say!
Rhea:​ Straight up, I never did homework. I don’t know how I – honestly?
Don’t know how I graduated high school. On like, charm.
Kristin:​ What were your – like, did you get good grades or did you get not
good grades?
Rhea:​ No! I got terrible grades in high school. I did not care.
Kristin:​ Okay.
Rhea:​ I was a smart kid. I did really well, and then I just stopped caring.
Kristin:​ Right.
Cameron:​ Well, it’s ‘cause you didn’t have anything to focus you, like –
Rhea:​ Parents?


Cameron:​ Vampires.
Kristin:​ Right.
Rhea:​ I needed one of those. Parents or vampires.
Jenny:​ Parents or vampires. So we go to the Epps household for like five
seconds and we see Chris come out of his ‘danger do not enter’ door and say
goodbye to his mom, who’s just watching endless clips of Daryl play football,
and smoking cigarettes, and not paying attention to anything. Very sad.
Kristin:​ Yeah, take it back.
Jenny:​ The word “sad” –
Kristin:​ You can’t say it anymore. It’s been robbed from us.
Jenny:​ Yeah. We’re not allowed to use it anymore, right?
Kristin:​ No, it’s horrible.
Jenny:​ Okay, it’s really too bad.
Kristin: ​There’s a lot of words that have been taken from us. [group
agreeing]
Rhea: ​Also, the thumbs up. Can’t really do that anymore.
Kristin: ​God.
Jenny:​ [sighing] Jesus.
Rhea:​ Anyway.
[group sighing]
Kristin:​ The saddest part of the podcast –
Rhea:​ Sad.


Kristin:​ Was the collective sighs of all four of us.
[group groaning]
Jenny:​ So we finally get a look at what Chris and Eric have been working
on. Which is of course a bunch of pieces of lady corpses sewn together.
Kristin:​ Lady corpses.
Jenny:​ Cameron got ​so ​bummed out.
Kristin:​ Yeah, Cameron, you were upset about this for a long part of the
episode. “Why does it have to be many women? Why do they have to be
sewn together? Why couldn’t anyone just date one woman, that was just
one woman?”
Rhea:​ It’s kinda funny.
Kristin:​ But he talks about it. He does answer the question, it just takes a
long time for you to get to the answer.
Jenny:​ Wha— what?
Kristin:​ The reason why they’re sewing the bodies together and not just
using one dead person that they’re reanimating is because they want her to
be just as terrifyingly undesirable as him—
Jenny:​ Ohh, right. So they’ll hide together, right.
Kristin:​ So that they can fall in love—
Rhea:​ Ew.
Kristin:​ Because they both never want to go outside.
Rhea: ​What is this, Passengers?
Cameron:​ So here’s my follow up to this.


Rhea:​ Is that it?
Cameron:​ Here’s my follow up to this. Okay, yeah, cheers, but like—
Rhea: ​No, don’t “cheers” it.
Cameron: ​They’re also making it very difficult on themselves. Like, just
take one woman and then—
Jenny:​ Cut her up!
Kristin:​ Yeah!
Rhea:​ She’s a reanimated dead thing! She’s gonna be terrified.
Jenny and Kristin:​ He’s one guy!
Cameron:​ That’s what I’m saying!
Jenny:​ Unnecessary scarring. All of that face tissue that’s been—
Rhea:​ So much time. They dug up so many—
Cameron:​ What happened to his face because he was in a rock climbing
accident. [people agreeing] How did his face get so—
Kristin:​ He must’ve fallen on his face.
Cameron:​ Awl
Rhea:​ Can I just say, and I apologize to point out something on a show that
people love, but I always find it takes me out of it when there’s a death—
Cameron:​ Frankenstein monster? [laughter]
Rhea:​ No, yeah. When there’s vampires, no. When there’s multiple deaths
at a high school and people are like, “what?” Like they didn’t hear about it.


Cameron:​ It was a different high school.
Rhea:​ But Daryl’s playing for that team.
Kristin:​ No, it was Sunnydale High School, but here’s the thing about
Sunny—
Rhea:​ Got it.
Cameron:​ No, the different high school where the girls went to.
Kristin:​ Yes, the girls—
Cameron:​ But you’re bringing up Daryl.
Rhea:​ Yes, but also— yes, okay. But I remember hearing about— I mean,
like, some— three girls get killed in car accident in a neighboring high
school, you’re gonna know about it when it happens.
Kristin:​ Unless you live on a Hellmouth.
Rhea:​ Of course.
Jenny:​ And people are dying all the time.
Rhea:​ But I was saying globally, any show that ever does this, it always
takes me out of it. Come on, they don’t need the microfiche to figure this
out. [laughter] They knew when it happened.
Kristin:​ I think the first episode of the whole series, there’s a dead guy in a
locker that falls out onto somebody else. And then the next scene is them all
in the hallway or outside and they’re like, “yeah, they cancelled gym.” The
first episode we were like, seriously, that’s it? There’s a dead person. But
then every episode—
Jenny:​ They just cancelled gym. If they closed school every time a high
school student died, they’d never— they’d be in full year – round classes.
Kristin:​ They drop like flies over there.


Cameron:​ There’s no larger governmental…
Kristin:​ No.
Rhea:​ Police officer of any kind?
Kristin:​ Police are never called.
Jenny:​ No, no, it’s a whole thing.
Kristin: ​Never called.
Jenny:​ Very strange.
Kristin:​ We’ve actually written that into some of the songs.
Rhea:​ Like, this is weird, it’s always been figured out, so.
Cameron:​ Sort of like an investigation of some kind about some sort of ring
that seems like is happening?
Kristin:​ No and Buffy is always breaking— because police are never seen
but there are sometimes caution tape or things that— and she’s always just
pushing it aside or going directly into a crime scene and touching everything.
[laughter] It’s just Sunnydale High School, you know? But I also do hear
you, Rhea.
Rhea: ​Yeah, it’s just a funny… I noticed it in this and I was like, this
happens all the time. It’s like this funny TV concept.
Kristin:​ Yeah, ‘cause if a person dies in high school that’s a big—
Rhea:​ It’s a big deal.
Kristin:​ It’s a big deal.
Jenny:​ You know what else is a big deal?!


Kristin:​ What, Jenny?
Jenny:​ Giles and Ms. Calendar are going to the big game.
Kristin:​ Oh my god.
Jenny:​ And it’s a date and also Ms. Calendar says one of my favorite jokes
in the whole series which is: “Please call me Jenny, Ms. Calendar is my
father.” What a great joke. [laughter]
Cameron:​ That’s a great joke.
Jenny:​ I love it so much!
Cameron:​ It’s a great joke. Also, she’s pretty hot.
Jenny: ​The last person who sat in that chair—
Kristin:​ In that chair.
Jenny:​ And said that was Gaby Dunn.
Kristin:​ Literally. [laughter] She was like, “she is so pretty.”
Rhea:​ It makes sense.
Cameron:​ Yeah, that does make sense. [laughter] It makes a lot of sense.
Jenny:​ Just look at her go.
Rhea:​ What does she teach?
Jenny:​ She’s the computer lab teacher and she’s also a techno – pagan!
Rhea:​ Oh yeah, techno – pagan.
Kristin:​ Yeah, she’s really good at—
Jenny:​ Earlier in the series, she helped them get a demon off of the internet


that had been scanned in.
Rhea:​ Mmm.
[group laughter]
Kristin:​ She’s a lady who knows what’s what. She knows how to work a
computer. She knows how to ask a guy out.
Jenny:​ She loves casting bones.
Rhea:​ She’s got a hot belt.
Kristin: ​Yes, the hottest of all belts on Jenny Calendar.
Rhea:​ You could hang a plant from that thing.
Jenny: ​And she loves sports. She loves football because it’s so rugged.
Kristin:​ She has a whole monologue, not a monologue—
Jenny:​ About American sports?
Kristin:​ Yeah, where she’s like, “it doesn’t have the…”
Jenny:​ “The grace of basketball or the poetry of baseball.” Do you relate to
that? The poetry of baseball?
Rhea:​ I do relate to that, actually. I was like, wow, that’s pretty right on.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Are you team Jenny Calendar?
Rhea:​ Apparently, yeah, when it comes to sports. [laughter]
Kristin: ​But yeah, I love their whole— this is really it for them. This is a big
episode for Giles and Jenny Calendar. Because they’ve just been stepping
around the issue of liking each other.


Jenny:​ Right, right, right.
Kristin:​ And now they’ve gone on their first date.
Jenny: ​Oh my god, also, his hop. His little victory hop—
Kristin:​ Yes!
Jenny:​ After he’s like, “that went well. I did nothing but somehow we’re still
going on a date.” Victory hop.
Kristin:​ It’s so great.
Jenny:​ Really nice.
Kristin:​ Also I just loved how she poked her head back out of the classroom
door. She was like, “I have to go to class” but then she came back out
anyway.
Jenny:​ She was like [silly voice] “not really.”
Cameron: ​Also, first date and I’m gonna say something that just… maybe
the blandest food. [laughter]
Rhea: ​You mean don’t go Mexican on the first date?
Cameron:​ I think don’t go Mexican and I would also say—
Rhea:​ Just go get a hot pretzel.
Cameron:​ Maybe no pasta with a ton of garlic. You know what I mean?
[group agreeing]
Rhea: ​Just get yourself a mall hot pretzel.
Cameron:​ Yeah, exactly. Just a slice of bread. A slice of toast. [laughter]
Rhea:​ I don’t know!


Kristin:​ Auntie Annie’s is that what it’s called? The pretzel place? [group
agrees]
Rhea:​ Yeah, but we had Hot Sams where I was growing up.
Jenny:​ Hot Sams?
Rhea:​ Back in the 80’s and early 90’s.
Cameron:​ I don’t think so. [laughter]
Rhea: ​It predated Auntie Anne’s. Auntie Anne’s was like a new thing that
people when I was in high school went and worked there and would bring us
pretzels the next morning.
Kristin:​ Yes!
Rhea:​ And we would eat disgusting, soggy… just drop a soggy, wet bread
bag on the table.
Kristin:​ Did you have Pretzel Time, is that a thing that everybody had?
[everyone says yes]
Kristin:​ ‘Cause I had friends that worked at Pretzel Time but that’s like the
definition of high school.
Rhea:​ Pretzel Time and Hot Sams are like the same company.
Kristin:​ Oh, really?
Rhea:​ I’m pretty sure.
Cameron: ​Pretzel Time and Hot Sams?
Rhea:​ Hot Sams is a goddamn thing. [laughter] And if you keep arguing
with me on this, we’re gonna get a divorce.


Cameron:​ What’s weird about this is one of them is so obvious about what
it is… Pretzel Time. [laughter] The other one, it’s like, what is this? [more
laughter]
Rhea:​ Yeah, but you know what I’d say when I went to Hot Sams? Do you
know what this it?
Kristin:​ I’ll have a Hot Sam?
Rhea:​ It’s pretzel time.
Kristin:​ Ohhh, I thought maybe they called the pretzels Hot Sams.
Cameron:​ That would make more sense!
Kristin:​ Right, then I’d love a Hot Sam. But I had friends who worked at
Pretzel Time and since that day that they began working, or telling me what
they did at Pretzel Time, I don’t think I have purchased a pretzel from a
place like that. Because they were disgusting, horrible high school students
who would like, kill a fly with the pretzel and then wrap it up.
[group sounds of disgust]
Jenny: ​Oh, what the fuck?!
Kristin:​ I know!
Rhea:​ You guys, it’s totally a thing. I put in Hot Sams and pretzels auto –
populated so…
Kristin:​ Wow.
Cameron: ​Well, I think it’s fake.
Rhea:​ It’s a real thing and I used to eat it all the time.
Jenny:​ Even the images that pop up kind of look fake.
Cameron:​ I think a techno – pagan implanted that on the internet.


[laughter]
Jenny: ​Yes! Yo, so when we do get a look at Daryl, I just want to make a
note—
Kristin:​ This was the most traumatic moment for Cameron. Daryl’s first
look.
Jenny:​ It was rough for Cameron.
Cameron:​ He was spooky at first, yeah. I didn’t like him very much.
Jenny:​ Were you at all disturbed by his posture? Which was sort of like if…
whatever you would call the central oval if you were drawing a really simple
human shape, his torso, I guess, is sort of a couple inches ahead of the rest
of his body. His legs are back and his arms—
Rhea:​ Coming in early, you mean?
Jenny:​ Yeah, coming in— I don’t know if you guys watched—
Rhea:​ Getting there ahead of time.
Jenny:​ New Years Rockin Eve with Ryan Seacrest, but Fergie is always the
Hollywood host and she kind of stands the same way. [laughter]
Kristin:​ She does, she really does. Oh God, I love her so much.
Rhea:​ I walk like that, which—
Cameron: ​Do you think you walk like Daryl? Sweetheart.
Rhea:​ Not like Daryl, [laughter] but I walk wrong.
Kristin:​ Torso first.
Rhea:​ Yeah. ‘Cause if ever I’m walking a lot and then I look and I’m like, oh
god, I look like I’m about to fall over.


Cameron:​ He has— that actor, god bless him, ‘cause I say this and it’s
gonna be kinda mean, but that person has real wacky fingers. Did you notice
this?
Kristen:​ [gasps] I did, I did. I didn’t notice it the first time and this time I
did.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Cameron: ​I don’t want to go too hard on Daryl, ‘cause there’s a real person
behind that, but that person has wacky fingers.
Jenny:​ But how much of that is…
Cameron:​ I don’t think that’s prosthetics. I think that’s that person’s
fingers.
Kristin:​ Yeah, they were like, we don’t have to do anything there.
Cameron:​ They are very, very big. Very big.
Kristin:​ And short and square.
Cameron:​ Very big. Very big hands. You know, there’s a sport in my
hometown of Chicago that’s called 16 Inch Softball where you have a really
soft ball and no mitts and you catch it with your hands. This guy’s got some
16 inch softball hands, is what I would say. [laughter] There’s a certain type
of guy who can catch those balls real easy.
Kristin:​ Also, do you know what was— sorry, I would love to keep talking
about—
Cameron: ​No, go ahead.
Kristin:​ Daryl’s hands forever, but the thing that occurred to me also
watching this was— so the mother is upstairs and she’s devastated. It’s very
depressing, it’s very sad. She’s just smoking cigarettes and watching—
[Jenny sighs] you know, reliving... but why haven’t they told her that Daryl’s
alive in the basement? I don’t understand.


Jenny:​ Great question!
Kristin:​ She’s a great candidate for fully accepting this.
Cameron: ​Yeah, I agree, she is. She’s already lost it.
Rhea:​ Yeah, why don’t they just set the two of them up on some couches
and let them hang out?
Kristin:​ Right? Yes.
Jenny:​ Watch football.
Kristin:​ They’d have a great life, watching Daryl’s best moments.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ It’s what Daryl wants. It’s what she wants.
Jenny:​ You’re right.
Rhea:​ I’m sorry he wants to date, but…
Cameron: ​Also, I really don’t like basements. [laughter] So I really don’t
like that she doesn’t know he’s down there.
Kristin:​ Yeahhh...
Cameron:​ I really don’t like that.
Kristin:​ Where do you think— do you have a root for this? Like, your
basement fear? Did you have a scary basement?
Cameron:​ Don’t you know that the root of all basement fears are that that’s
where murdering happens? [laugher] Are you kidding?
Jenny:​ The fact that you would even have to ask.


Kristin:​ No, I’m not suggesting that basements aren’t terrifying. But you get
especially scared, and like, have you just always gotten especially scared?
Cameron:​ Well, yeah. I had a basement in my house and I’ve just never
been able to see in my entire life very well, and so I think it was really
spooky.
Kristin:​ Right.
Cameron:​ But also, I don’t know. [laughter] Every show and TV and movie
has very bad basements in it.
Kristin:​ That’s true.
Jenny:​ Nothing good ever happens in the basement.
Cameron:​ Very bad basements.
Kristin:​ That’s a prime horror spot, is a basement.
Cameron:​ Dislike it a lot and can’t even process it. And thank god in
California almost nobody has basements.
Rhea:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ When you travel, ‘cause you travel a lot, and you’re in a hotel
room, do you have to check under the bed and in the shower and stuff like
that?
Jenny:​ Why wouldn’t you check under the bed and in the shower?! You
have to check for bad guys!
Kristin:​ I know you do it, we’re married. I’m asking our guests.
Jenny:​ Sorry. [yelling] It’s just common fucking sense! [laugher]
Cameron:​ Definitely, I also check the closet.
Jenny:​ Yeah!


Kristin:​ What about you, Rhea, do you check anything?
Rhea: ​No, I don’t check anything.
Kristin:​ Yeah, me either.
Rhea:​ There’s nobody in there.
Cameron: ​But now, speaking of which, I haven’t checked anywhere in your
house. [laughter]
Kristin:​ Well, we’re all here.
Cameron:​ What an elaborate ruse, [yelling] for you to kill me! [laughter]
Kristin:​ That would be a great plot twist. I’m like, “so do you normally
check the closets?”
Cameron: ​I know! [yelling] I don’t like it! I don’t like it! I don’t like it at all!
Rhea:​ Do you know how scared she gets?
Cameron:​ Seriously, I’m so scared. When I went to see Blair Witch with my
high school boyfriend, we were driving home and he was trying to kiss me
and I was like— I just remember this moment where he was trying to kiss
me and then he looked out the window, and I was like, “Who’s out there?
The witch?!” [laughter] “The witch out there? I know you’re in on it!” And
then I just got out of the car and went in my house.
Jenny:​ Oh my god.
Kristin:​ Also, “the witch,” the one.
Jenny: ​Were you laboring under the idea that—
Rhea:​ It was real?
Jenny:​ It was real? When you saw it, did you think maybe it was real?


Cameron:​ Well, we all did, yeah, ‘cause the internet wasn’t around.
Jenny:​ Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kristin:​ Oh, Blair Witch, right. I forgot where we started so I was like, what
was real? The witch? What did we all think was real? [laughter]
Cameron: ​But I also kind of thought everything was real.
Jenny:​ Mhm.
Cameron:​ I kind of still do
Kristin: ​Also, I just want to say that I very much understand the fear. I’m
really sorry that I looked directly at you and pretended like that there was
something in the closet because that would freak me out. [Cameron laughs]
Cameron:​ [sighs] Ahh, breathing.
Kristin:​ Last night— my sister and I scare very easily and are very weird
people. And last night, something happened with the TV. They were over at
our house and the Apple TV rebooted and because our actual television is
from like 1970 or whatever, I don’t know what happened. But a loud static
just started happening. And my sister jumped from the couch and buried her
entire head in my torso and I was, like, with her. I covered her ears and was
like, “it’s okay, it was nice to have you as a sister.” [laugher] And Jenny and
her boyfriend Brian were like, “what is wrong with you?” We were 100%
convinced that we were dying. And we were going to be killed.
Cameron:​ Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Rhea:​ Tensions are high these days.
Kristin:​ Yep. It’s true. [laughter]
Rhea:​ Tensions are a little high. Just a little stressed out. Hey, remember
when kids used to hide under their desks?


Kristin:​ Oh, god.
Jenny:​ For real.
Rhea: ​I feel like I’m just doing that all the time.
Kristin:​ That’s our new life. [loudly] Well, this is… sorry. I got excited. Not
about it, but just that we have people here who also hate the world.
[laughter] So our episodes air on Wednesdays and we’re all feeling a lot of
pressure building because we’re getting closer and closer to this thing
actually happening. And Jenny and I— we don’t talk about politics or the
world a lot directly on the podcast ‘cause we like to give people a place to
escape—
Rhea:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ These things. But that said, we have talked a little about how things
like science fiction and a show like ​Buffy ​is really important and takes on
new meaning in times like this. So I just— I don’t know. I wonder, especially
Cameron, ‘cause you have a relationship with the show and with the genre,
if there’s anything— and Rhea, I don’t mean to take you out of the question.
But if there are any touchstones for you guys that are either helping you
because they’re like “fuck yeah, we can fight and we can win” or if they’re
just taking you away and letting you… you know, breathe for a moment.
Cameron:​ That’s so great. You know… well, a couple of years ago, I stopped
being able to watch action movies as much because—
Rhea:​ We both did.
Cameron:​ Yeah, and we’ve talked about why.
Rhea:​ Because we used to have a podcast about it.
Cameron:​ We used to have a podcast about action movies because we both
love action and sci – fi movies. But then… this is a very serious thing I’m
gonna say. As gun violence started to become in the news constantly here in
the U.S., I felt like I could no longer contribute money to something that felt
like I was watching things that really happen and real people get harmed


and so—
Rhea:​ And it was also difficult seeing these things in the news and being
aware of what’s going on, and then watching this movie, and it’s happening
in this movie for, like, entertainment.
Cameron:​ It doesn’t transport anymore.
Rhea:​ And it wasn’t feeling like it was— you know, it was feeling like, oh,
this is just silly entertainment. I was like, I’m watching this happen to actual
people everyday.
Cameron:​ Yeah and so I have had this sort of hole in the things that I
appreciate, because I haven’t found the right things often of late. And one
thing that I really loved was The Force Awakens because it’s such a hopeful
story and it has a lot of great female characters. We also saw Rogue One
and I liked Rogue One, uh, less. But I think both of those movies and the
original 4 – 6 of Star Wars have been giving me a little more… hope is the
word, lately. Because... both on camera and off camera. You know, we just
watched the HBO documentary on Carrie Fisher’s life last night, with her
mom and—
Rhea:​ Debbie Reynolds.
Cameron:​ Debbie Reynolds and it’s called Bright Lights. That’s really
inspiring because it’s amazing to see what somebody can do with the focus
that she got, being in those movies. And then also, what I think Star Wars is
trying to do is celebrate peace and finding peace inside of yourself and
finding peace inside of others. There is still violence, obviously, in these
movies. And what I also love is that there are female characters. Some.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Cameron:​ There’s still like, only seven in the universe of… the universe.
[laughter]
Kristin:​ But there’s some.
Cameron:​ But there’s some.


Kristin:​ Yeah.
Cameron:​ So that’s something that I’ve really found is helpful lately.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Rhea:​ I also would recommend— a lot of people watched it right after
everything, but the movie Arrival was a really great science fiction story for
getting along with people and what talking can do.
Kristin:​ Mmmm.
Rhea: ​You know, understanding
Cameron:​ It’s like the same thing. It’s really about peace.
Rhea:​ It’s really about the force and understanding each other. And then
also the movie Hidden Figures—
Jenny:​ Oh, yeah!
Rhea:​ Which is not sci – fi but it’s about science.
Jenny:​ It’s just sci. [laugher]
Rhea: ​Yeah, exactly!
Cameron: ​Straight up sci.
Rhea:​ Sci – non – fi. And just seeing that. And something that— there’s a
lot of things that struck me about that movie. Something else that I’ve been
thinking, too, ‘cause I’m just thinking about it and who it’s about and all
this. And obviously these women’s stories weren’t told for multiple reasons
but the fact that it’s like— well, I didn’t know anybody that was— I mean, I
knew the astronauts ‘cause everybody cares about the astronauts. But I
would never think, oh, there were these— tons of black women doing this.
It’s so much easier— your brain is trained to just think, oh, it’s a bunch of
white dudes.


Kristin:​ Totally.
Jenny:​ Mhm.
Rhea: ​And so those stories are making me really happy because they are
just telling a story. And I think that’s what we need to do, is just tell each
other stories and remind each other that hey, we’re all just people and the
things we’re trying to talk about are just our experiences in our lives.
Cameron:​ And that we were there then. I mean, I’m not a black woman but
I’m a queer woman and I feel like our history is erased. And it’s nice to look
back and see moments where there were people that we don’t tell their
stories.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Cameron:​ ‘Cause it makes me think, oh, maybe I was there. Maybe there
were people like me there.
Kristin:​ Right. And the more that we hear and uncover it, it’s like, the more
we know we were there. [people agreeing] And then we get to know we are
here. [more agreeing] And then we can still do that shit.
Cameron: ​This show does that too. I mean, there’s a lot of amazing female
characters in this show. Not as much racial—
Rhea:​ You mean ​Buffy the Vampire Slayer​?
Cameron:​ Yeah. Not enough racial diversity—
Kristin:​ No, a lot of white people in Sunnydale.
Cameron:​ But they did cover a lot of other things.
Rhea:​ Interesting though, obviously to 2017 standards, it doesn’t hold up.
But I am just saying, even though this show is all white people, there are
people of color in the background, which is something. It’s saying something
that there are people… ‘cause I’ve watched shows even that are coming out


now that it’s all white people in the background. And it’s very glaring and
you’re like, “ho – how did this happen? What is this?”
Kristin:​ Right. And we’ve seen a couple— was it last week that the head
vampire… was it last week?
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ The head vampire was a black man. But not a lot.
Rhea:​ Yeah, it’s not a lot.
Kristin:​ There’s a little bit. Well, thanks for sharing that. I know that wasn’t
super on – episode, but on – topic with Buffy. I mean, I am finding that this
rewatch for us is really helping me too. It’s just nice to see. You said
something when she kicked— oh, I think I wrote it down, hold on. I wrote
down a couple of Cameron quotes [Cameron laughs]. Well, there’s “she has
a whole fresh body” but that’s— [laughter] we’ll get to that.
Cameron: ​[laughing] Well, she does! Just use Cordelia.
Kristin: ​You said something about— where is it?
Rhea:​ It’s so weird to cut the head off and put it on the old thing.
Jenny:​ Well, there was a really nice moment in a little while when Buffy
catches a knife that Eric throws—
Kristin:​ That’s the moment!
Jenny:​ And Cameron said, “She’s cool all the time!”
Kristin:​ Yep, there it is. “She’s cool all the time.”
Jenny:​ Which is like, yeah, she is.
Kristin:​ She is. She’s a fighter.
Cameron: ​She is cool all the time.


Kristin:​ She’s always kicking ass. And she’s fallible, which makes her even
cooler, you know?
Jenny:​ Mmm.
Rhea:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ That she makes mistakes and she fucks up but then she’s still like,
“thunk, got your knife, motherfucker.” [laughter]
Cameron:​ Oh, and they’re also real friends. This episode is a bad example
of that. But I love in other episodes that they also have real friendships with
each other and have real high school problems? Because I think that’s also
cool to see in this show. They could’ve just skipped it and had them
constantly fighting a zillion things but…
Kristin: ​Yeah. Which really was this episode. It’s kind of an anomaly to the
rest of what we’ve seen so far. Usually there’s more, I don’t know…
Jenny:​ Dimensions.
Kristin:​ Yeah!
Cameron: ​Maybe Giles got the— we got the B story or whatever.
Jenny: ​Giles really got the story.
Kristin:​ Yeah, that’s true. Ah, Giles deserves a little love in his life.
Jenny:​ He at least gets to sit next to a girl and talk to her for five seconds
before Xander and Willow show up and start eating their popcorn.
Kristin: ​Yes. I just want to backtrack for one second ‘cause I don’t want to
miss this moment. When Cordelia first gets kidnapped, when they put the
bag over her head—
Jenny:​ Sure.


Kristin:​ I mean, she doesn’t get kidnapped, she gets bagged.
Jenny:​ Mhm.
Kristin:​ And then Buffy saves her. And you’re like, wow, Cordy, you just
made it. And she’s like, “I’ve gotta go, I’m the apex.”
Rhea: ​Yeah.
Jenny:​ Right, right, of the mid – field pyramid.
Kristin:​ Sure.
Rhea:​ She just totally shakes it off and is like, gotta go. There’s just a pile
of—
Cameron: ​But then she’s kidnapped, and so then I guess, what does
happen to that pyramid?
Kristin:​ Yeah, then the pyramid— right?
Jenny:​ Hmmm.
Cameron:​ So we never find out.
Kristin:​ We don’t know.
Rhea:​ It’s just got a flat top to it.
Kristin:​ It’s a flat – top. The old flat – top.
Rhea:​ The old flat – top pyramid.
Cameron: ​Table mountain.
[laughter]
Kristin:​ Anyhow, now you can go back on where you were. You know, I’m a
big Cordelia…


Jenny:​ Well, speaking of Cordelia, how about the anatomical illustration
with the photograph of Cordelia’s head affixed?
Rhea:​ And it fits so perfectly.
Kristin:​ It does.
Jenny: ​What are the odds?
Rhea:​ How did they do it?
Kristin: ​Also, I love that they have not only a lab, but a dark room.
[laughter]
Cameron:​ Yes!
Kristin:​ Right? They had to fully develop those photos.
Cameron:​ It is making me vom—
Rhea:​ Whoa.
Cameron:​ To think about what must’ve been underneath that—
Jenny:​ The sheet?
Cameron:​ Ugh. I understand—
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Cameron: ​Guys, I understand this is not the scariest thing in the entire
world. But okay, let’s be— let’s do real talk.
Kristin: ​Okay, real talk.
Rhea: ​They don’t have, like, a locker.
Cameron:​ You’re laying there on the table and then they’re like, “uh, this


might hurt a little. You’re gonna feel a little pinch around your neck” or
whatever and then they flip up the thing and then you just see a headless
bod and you’re like, “oh no I’m the head!” That’s the worst. [laughter]
Kristin: ​Yeah.
Rhea: ​I feel like in real life, you’d be like [vomiting noises]. Just vomiting.
Kristin: ​Just vomiting. [laughter]
Cameron:​ Yes! Yes!
Rhea: ​[more noises] Passing out, foaming everywhere.
Cameron: ​Yeah, exactly.
Kristin: ​Also and I know why they did this, because they were building the
ideal girlfriend for the football player. But they really went out of their way
to make sure you knew that they had chosen the bustiest—
Rhea:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Middle portion of the three girls.
Jenny:​ Mmm.
Kristin: ​The sheet was like totally flat except for giant boobs.
Cameron:​ Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god, I hate… [laughter] Also not
to skip way ahead, but the end of the episode, Buffy’s like, “so why’d you do
it” or whatever and then he’s like, “well, ‘cause my brother always protected
me and I felt like I had to bring him back.” And I really feel like he really
skated on by—
Kristin:​ Right?
Cameron:​ ‘Cause I do not agree that this is a good way to deal with grief.
Kristin:​ He got to be the normal kid who just got caught up in grief.


Rhea:​ So question though, what was Eric getting out of all of this and why
was he so into it?
Jenny: ​I think he just had a boner the whole time.
Rhea:​ Yeah, he’s a real creep.
Kristin: ​We did hear about his porn collection briefly.
Rhea: ​[sounds of disgust]
Kristin:​ So, yeah. He was the creep.
Jenny:​ Which hey, not that there’s anything wrong with porn.
Kristin:​ No, but…
Jenny:​ Porn shaming? Was that really necessary.
Rhea:​ Him being really into porn is gross.
Jenny:​ Is a bummer.
Kristin:​ Yes, exactly. Precisely.
Rhea:​ He’s not into it for the right reasons. [laughter] He has no respect.
Cameron:​ I really want them both to get the help that they need.
Rhea: ​They need some counseling, for sure.
Kristin:​ Well, what happened— oh yeah, they do save Eric. What’s gonna
happen to Eric? And also, you guys, sorry to pull apart this episode now, but
it’s just falling apart. It’s unspooling—
Jenny:​ Mmmm.
Kristin:​ Right in front of me. Because the brother dies in a rock climbing


accident. Did he dig his brother up? Is that what we’re to believe, that he
dug him up out of his grave?
Jenny: ​Yeah, I think that’s all that we have to work with.
Cameron:​ Yeah, and the weird thing about that is— okay, so his brother—
Rhea:​ He didn’t need a new head?
Cameron:​ Right, that’s a great one, that he didn’t need a new head. Good
point.
Rhea:​ Because they were talking about the formaldehyde.
Jenny:​ They must’ve done it very quickly, or…
Cameron:​ So he did it as soon as he fell down. So here’s my other follow up
question—
Rhea:​ [yelling] “Oh my god, you’re dead! Hang on, let me put you back
together.”
Cameron:​ Did he have this research done in the past?
Kristin:​ Right. I mean, he is a science—
Rhea:​ He was really good at science.
Jenny:​ Which means you can bring people back from the dead.
Cameron: ​These are unrelated things.
Rhea:​ He’s really good at science fair. And then he has a book.
Cameron:​ ‘Cause the whole thing is about, like, there’s time requirements—
Rhea: ​Why do they have that book in that town?
Cameron:​ They’re, like, really stressed out about how they gotta get stuff


done real fast. But then they— it’s unclear. It’s unclear.
Rhea:​ And then he’s just kind of moping around a little bit.
Cameron: ​And these boys, they need to go to the doctor.
Rhea:​ It definitely smells in there.
Kristin:​ And you know what, I have a feeling based on my knowledge of
Sunnydale High School, they’re not gonna get the help they need.
Cameron:​ That sounds right.
Kristin:​ And thne they’ll be right back.
Cameron:​ And I’ll also say, the old science lab— that was at the school
though?
Kristin:​ Yeah, supposedly that was at the school.
Cameron: ​So there’s a new science lab and then the old science lab is so
infrequently maintained by any staff or sort of maintenance person—
Rhea:​ Yet still exists.
Kristin:​ That you can build a Frankenstein in it.
Jenny: ​I think there’s actually the same abandoned science building in
Jennifer’s Body?
Cameron:​ Oh, no.
Jenny:​ Oh, you probably haven’t seen that ‘cause it would scare you?
Kristin:​ Don’t you have a relationship with Jennifer’s Body?
Cameron:​ Well, Diablo Cody went to my high school.
Kristin:​ Such a weird thing to come up.


Cameron:​ The skirt that Jennifer is wearing on the cover of Jennifer’s Body
is our uniform skirt.
Jenny:​ Wow. Wow.
Kristin:​ It was a random thing to bring up.
Rhea:​ Yeah, can you believe it?
Jenny:​ Wow.
Cameron:​ Did you know that in advance? Maybe I’ve told you that.
Jenny:​ That was buried. I did know that somewhere, but not actively. I
really was just thinking there’s an abandoned—
Rhea: ​You do talk about it all the time. [laughter]
Cameron: ​I do. Why wouldn’t I? It’s the weirdest.
Rhea:​ I know. It’s weird.
Kristin:​ Okay, so in the basement is where they keep him, but at the
science lab is where they’re building her.
Cameron:​ Who drove the car also, you know what I mean?
Jenny:​ Hmmm.
Cameron: ​Anyway, the other question I would have is... the brother who’s
at the end talking to Buffy, Chris—
Jenny:​ Mhm, mhm
Cameron:​ Like “it got away from me” or whatever. So he’s just lost his
brother again.
Kristin:​ Yes.


Jenny:​ Yeah.
Cameron:​ It would feel like maybe he would be sad.
Kristin:​ Yeah. They gave it that one dramatic moment with the fire where
he was like, trying to get there but he couldn’t and he had to let him go.
Cameron:​ But then, you know, he’s still actually dead now.
Kristin:​ Right.
Cameron:​ He ​hasn’t ​been dead.
Kristin:​ Right and now he is really actually dead.
Cameron:​ Now he’s dead.
Rhea:​ “Daryyyllll!” I do love that his character’s name is Daryl. [laughter] It
just gives it an extra touch. “Daryyllll.”
Cameron:​ Ugh, I’m so grossed out by this.
Kristin:​ I want to say, I appreciate the sacrifice that you made to be on this
podcast.
Jenny:​ Yeah, so brave.
Cameron: ​Yeah, I’m grossed out.
Kristin: ​Yeah. And not intentionally, but we seem to have picked the
episode that I think might have been one of the worst for you. [laughter]
Jenny:​ Yeah, yeah, yeah. [group agrees]
Cameron: ​There’s like basements and then the head and everything.
Jenny:​ How about Daryl running back into the fire and climbing on top of
the headless, sewn together corpse bits and whispering, “We’ll be together


forever. You’re mine”? [grossed – out sounds]
Kristin:​ Yeah, well... I mean, to give Daryl a little credit, he is a
reanimated…
Jenny:​ Yeah, yeah, yeah, he’s not operating probably with full faculties.
Kristin:​ No. Let him go. Let him have his—
Cameron:​ Do you think he’s scared of himself?
Kristin: ​Yeah.
Cameron:​ I feel like I would be so creeped out. [laughter]
Kristin:​ Yeah. He doesn’t want to go outside, he doesn’t wanna— yeah. I
know we have to talk about Angel and Buffy. It’s important.
Jenny: ​“I saw the fire and figured you’d be here.”
Kristin:​ Right? What is he doing? [laughter]
Cameron: ​That’s what I’m trying to figure out. Where does he come from?
Jenny:​ I just feel like he’s not him in this episode. You know what I mean?
Kristin: ​Yeah, he’s a little off.
Jenny:​ Like, he’s written...
Cameron:​ It’s confusing whether or not he can fly. Do you know what I
mean? I know he can’t fly but his name is Angel and he always pops up.
[laughter] So I just feel like that might be a secret part.
Kristin:​ Maybe.
Jenny:​ Right, right.
Rhea: ​He’s always just running into the— shaking off a little bit.


Kristin:​ Also, he’s supposed— his history is that he’s an incredible warrior
vampire. Like, he’s one of the strongest vampires of all time. And yet the
whole episode opens where this dinky vampire comes out of the ground—
Jenny:​ Oh my god, he runs right into the fucking shovel!
Kristin:​ He gets knocked out with the fucking shovel like [snaps] that. Like,
what?
Jenny:​ Maybe he got thrown off because he had to wear a beige
windbreaker. Sorry.
Kristin: ​Yeah, that’s true.
Rhea:​ Beige windbreaker is a problem. Always. [laughter]
Kristin:​ Rhea, do you have anything you want to share after your—
Jenny:​ This experience?
Kristin: ​I mean, this is a big deal. This is a big moment for you.
Rhea:​ No, I enjoyed the show. I had a great time watching it. It was fun
time – traveling back to that time in my life. Trying to think of all the times
when I would see bumpers for Buffy during other things, of like, “what’s
next on Buffy.”
Kristin:​ Right.
Rhea:​ So that was really fun.
Kristin:​ I feel we’re tied together forever now.
Rhea:​ Yeah, for sure.
Kristin: ​That we can say that we were with you the first time.
Rhea:​ I’ll remember this forever. The first time I watched Buffy and the first


time my dog wore a hat that was a promotional item with a candle. A hat
that was designed to fit on a candle fit on my dog. [laughter] So pretty great
day. All in all.
Kristin: ​Win – win.
Rhea:​ I feel fantastic.
Kristin:​ Thank you both for being on our podcast.
Jenny:​ Yeah, thank you so much for being here.
Kristin:​ It’s been really great to have you.
Cameron:​ Oh yeah, so great! You know we have a podcast that’s called Put
Your Hands Together.
Kristin: ​Yeah!
Cameron:​ If anybody liked listening to us here, you can hear us do stand –
up there.
Rhea: ​Check that out. I have a feeling we’ll probably talk about Buffy next
week. I mean, it’s in our brains. We’ll probably talk about it a little bit.
Cameron: ​Yeah, as long as…
Kristin:​ Well, you better now. We’re all gonna come waiting for Buffy.
Rhea:​ Yeah, awesome. Come on over.
Cameron: ​Cheers!
Kristin:​ Also, I feel like you probably already know this listeners but Rhea
and Camera have a show…[joking] Rhean and Camera. [laughter]
Jenny:​ A fucking fantastic show!
Kristin:​ A fantastic show.


Rhea:​ Oh, thanks.
Cameron:​ Thank you.
Kristin: ​Called Take My Wife.
Jenny:​ You can see it on SeeSo.
Kristin:​ And you should see it on SeeSo immediately.
Cameron: ​Yes.
Jenny:​ Stop cheating yourselves out of a fantastic viewing experience. Start
living your best life.
Kristin: ​It’s important. You’ll thank us. Or you’re saying, “We’ve already
seen it. Of course we’ve seen it.” [laughter] “Shut up, Kristin and Jenny.”
Rhea: ​[silly voice] Watch it again!
Kristin: ​Yeah.
Jenny: ​Yeah, watch it again.
Kristin: ​But yeah, and thank you for all the things you do! You know?
Jenny:​ Oh yeah!
Cameron:​ Aw, you guys!
Kristin:​ You’re doing great work. It’s nice to be in the room with two
humans doing bad – ass work out there, you know?
Rhea:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ So thanks.
Cameron:​ Ahh, I’m holding my fists in the air!


Rhea: ​They’re up.
Kristin:​ So before we go we like to wolf – howl out and we were wondering
if you would wolf – howl with us.
Cameron:​ Sure!
Kristin: ​Great.
Rhea: ​I can’t wait to see what Murph’s gonna do for this.
Cameron:​ Yeah.

What’s up with this grave?
You know yesterday
It had a girl in it but now she’s away
They’re using her parts
And other girls’ parts
Could this be more disgusting?
Ah, Cordelia found parts
When Daryl was in high school, he played football
Till he fell from some rocks and died
Then his science nerd brother brought him back to life
Now he’s looking for a zombie bride
Yeah
Eric’s a dick
These dudes are so sick
They just need a head to finish and Cordelia’s their pick
So during the game
They whisked her away
But the abandoned science building will soon be in flames
When Daryl was in high school, he played football
Till he fell from some rocks and died
Then his science nerd brother brought him back to life
So he’s looking for a zombie bride


One nice thing that happened today
Giles and Jenny Calendar went on a date
Hope they do it again
Well, you know what they say
Librarians and techno – pagans always find a way
When Daryl was in high school, he played football
Till he fell from some rocks and died
Then his science nerd brother brought him back to life
But he’ll never have a zombie bride
And Cordelia’s still alive
