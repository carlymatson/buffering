#Buffering the Vampire Slayer
Episode 7.17: Lies My Parents Told Me
[CHIME]
Jenny:
Hey, everybody!
Kristin:
Oh, hello! Wow. Just 17 episodes into the
seventh season of a television
show that we started talking about in 2016.
Jenny:
It’s very casual, Kristin. We are very casually
approaching…
Kristin:
Very. Chill.
Jenny:
Are we approaching something significant? I
don’t know.
Kristin:
[sarcastic] Noo.
Jenny:
I can’t think of anything.
Kristin:
No. As a matter of fact, you know, you can
join us in person and tell us to
our faces that everything is gonna be just fine and nothing ever comes to an end.
In Chicago—in literally, like, less than two weeks—just a little over one week, really.
July 23rd and 24th. Here’s the deal. There are in-person still available for the show
on Saturday, July 23rd, at Lincoln Hall in Chicago. What are we doing? Oh, um,
nothing, no big deal. We’re just talking about the entire history of Fuffy that leads
us to Dirty Girls—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] You’ve heard of them.
Kristin:
[laughs] You’ve heard of them. You’ve heard
the rumors on the streets.
Jenny:
Uh-huh.
Kristin:
We’re gonna be talking, in podcast-y form.
We’re gonna be delivering
PowerPoint presentations, scientifically. We’re going to be performing some
dramatic readings of erotic novels. You can guess which one of us is gonna do that.
Jenny:
Mmhmm.
Kristin:
And performing some live music. You can guess
which one of us is gonna
do that.
Jenny:
Mmhmm!
Kristin:
[laughs] You should come. It’s gonna be a
good time. Sunday night, July
24th, the in-person tickets are sold out, because you all wanna hear us talk about
things like Caleb more than you wanna hear us talk about Bad Girls? [Jenny laughs]
It doesn’t make sense to me, but regardless, it’s sold out. [laughs]
Jenny:
To each their own.
Kristin:
To each their own. We are doing a live taping
of Dirty Girls, but if you
didn’t get tickets to Sunday night, don’t worry because that night has a virtual
option. You can attend the live taping virtually through Moment House. Tickets are
only ten bucks. The merch is super cool and it’s exclusive to those of you in person
and virtually. No one else can get the cool tees and hoodie.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Whaaaat!
Kristin:
And tickets are at momenthouse.com/bufferingthevampireslayer.
Also, all
of this information is on our calendar at bufferingthevampireslayer.com.
Jenny:
Now. Kristin.
Kristin:
Mmm.
Jenny:
Listen. Listen to me as I tell you…a little
story.
Kristin:
I can’t wait.
Jenny:
Some might say I am a storyteller in this regard,
and that is…[Kristin
laughs] relevant. Because I need to tell you the story of the results of the Sexual
Tension Award poll for Storyteller, Season 7, Episode 16.
Kristin:
[sings] “This is a story of a poll! [Jenny
gasps then snorts] Got some votes
and ran the whole world!”
Jenny:
Uhh. A strong start.
Kristin:
Thank you.
Jenny:
Here’s the thing. When you hear these names, you’re gonna think, how did
they not win? They sound like they are meant to go together, but they are all the
way back in fourth place, with 11% of the vote. It’s Spike and Wood.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
Wood and Spike!
Kristin:
Mmhmm. Nobody got a lot of votes—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Spikes are often made of wood!
Kristin:
Nobody—this was a sweep. This was basically
a sweep.
Jenny:
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Kristin:
For good cause.
Jenny:
In third place, I don’t like it. This…deserves
better, but here we are.
Apparently the first place contender was just too powerful.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
In third place, with 12% of the vote, it’s
Buffy and Robin! In second place,
with 19% of the vote—you know, they’ve been getting a significant chunk of the
vote so far this season, ‘cause they just have a lot of—I wouldn’t call it heat,
exactly. But maybe there’s, like, a ver—like, something that’s similar to heat that
only exists in, like, the Star Trek world, or maybe the Klingon word for heat is what
they share. It’s Xandrew. Second place, 19%. And sweeping the Sexual Tension
Awards for the Storyteller episode, with 58% of the vote. In first place, it’s Buffy,
Spike and cereal! Crunch-crunch! [Kristin laughs] The most important meal of the
day, it’s often been said.
Kristin:
It is. Eat a well balanced breakfast with
your naked vampire. That is what
the FDA suggests. They recommend.
Jenny:
Yeah, this looks like a cereal commercial on
1080P HGTV. [both laugh]
Kristin:
So, congratulations, cereal. You’ll have
to let us know your address
[laughs] so we can mail you the trophy.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
Okay, we’re gonna get into this episode,
‘cause it’s a—it’s a rough one,
okay? It’s a hard one for us. You—there’s a lot of sighing and a lot of yelling. We’re
just really having a time with this one, so we’re gonna get there. Before we do, just
a couple of other things to note. One, hey, we’re three episodes, almost four
episodes, into our new Yellowjackets podcast on Patreon. It’s called Doomcoming—
Jenny:
Yeah!
Kristin:
It’s a good time. Jenny and I can’t stop.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] It’s very fun.
Kristin:
Like, we literally can’t stop talking. We,
like, just can’t. We’re so excited
about it. [Jenny laughs] We are four episodes in, about to be five, into our new First
Kill podcast, which is me and LaToya Ferguson, also on Patreon. We’re having a
good time. So come hang out.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] It’s my new favorite podcast.
Kristin:
Come hang out. What’d you say?
Jenny:
It’s my new favorite podcast, I love it so
much.
Kristin:
[laughs] Kiss, Kiss, Kiss: First Kill?
Jenny:
That’s right.
Kristin:
[laughs] Also, very big thanks to Alba and
Charlie Peppers, our listener.
They both did a little mini episode. You can get the full episode in the link in the
show notes, and there is a segment in this episode that you’ll hear later on. Thank
you to both of them for that.
Jenny:
Yeah!
Kristin:
And hey, one last thing. Instead of reading
an email today, I’m gonna tell
you about something fun to do in Chicago if you’re coming to be a Dirty Girl with
us. If you’re coming to Chicago, or you just fucking live there or nearby, there’s a
super rad event that’s happening in Chicago, on Friday, July 22nd. Wow, you can
have, like, a Dirty Girl three-day weekend if you want.
Jenny:
Wow.
Kristin:
Our very own Facebook mod extraordinaire,
Rosemary Maybe, is going to
be performing in something called Suckfest. That’s right.
Jenny:
Yes!
Kristin:
It’s called Suckfest. It’s described as a
blood-sucking cosplay
extravaganza.
Jenny:
Slurp-slurp!
Kristin:
[laughs] So, clearly this is something that
would be of interest to many of
you. Rosemary, performing as Nadja, so hopefully you know that reference.
Hopefully you are a fan of What We Do in the Shadows.
Jenny:
I am.
Kristin:
It’s gonna be a very good time. You can find
all the information you need
to at berlinchicago.com. We’ll put the link in the show notes today as well. Literally
could not think of a better way to kick off Dirty Girls weekend, so go, support
Rosemary, have a good time at Suckfest. Oh my god. [laughs]
Jenny:
Yeah! It’s gonna rock.
Kristin:
Alright. Jenny—well, now that we’ve had all
this fun, let’s go have the
opposite of fun. [Jenny laughs] In this episode.
Jenny:
Hey, there’s some fun to be had in this episode,
I hope?
Kristin:
[simultaneously] There’s a little bit of
fun. There’s a little bit of fun.
Jenny:
Okay.
Kristin:
If you need to—if you need to just, like,
put us on mute and let it play so
that we, like, get your listen but you don’t wanna, like, hear us be mad, that’s fine
too. But you know, just turn the volume down, don’t turn it off. [laughs]
Jenny:
Indeed.
Kristin:
Alright. Let’s get outta here.
Jenny:
Bye! I mean, here we go! [Kristin laughs]
[Buffering theme plays]
Jenny:
Hello. And welcome to Buffering the Vampire
Slayer, a podcast where we
are watching and discussing every episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, one by one,
spoiler free, in tandem with those gals whomst, should they call me from LA and
say they need me to come help them with something right away, I would go
immediately, without delay, answering their call.
Kristin:
Mmm.
Jenny:
Angel on Top!
Kristin:
They both do have fairly effeminate voices,
as well. [both laugh]
Jenny:
Wow! I’m telling them you said that, Kristin.
[Kristin laughs] I’m Jenny
Owen Youngs.
Kristin:
And I’m Kristin Russo and hey, this week,
we’re talking about Buffy,
Season 7, Episode 17. I get more and more anxious as these numbers are going
up. Not gonna lie to you, I can’t hide it anymore.
Jenny:
Stressful.
Kristin:
Lies My Parents Told Me. Stay tuned at the
end of this podcast every week
for an original song, written by Jenny, recapping the Buffy episode we are
discussing. Also, I want to let you know, Jenny, before you even say—well, actually,
you can say who wrote it, because it does involve the person who wrote it.
Jenny:
But you don’t want me to say who directed it?
Kristin:
[laughing] No, you can also say who directed
it.
Jenny:
I’ll do my whole bit? Okay.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] You can say your whole bit.
Jenny:
[inhales] Lies My Parents Told Me was written
by David Fury and Drew
Goddard, and directed by David Fury. And it originally aired on March 25th, 2003.
Kristin:
Now that you’ve said that, I have two things
to say.
Jenny:
Hit me.
Kristin:
[laughs] So the first one is that, in the
DVD commentaries, David Fury
explains that the episode was originally titled “Mother and Son,” until Drew Goddard
pointed out that it was also about Buffy breaking ties with her father figure.
Jenny:
We’ve got mommy issues, we’ve got daddy issues.
[Kristin laughs] This
episode has something for everyone!
Kristin:
[laughs] And the other thing is that this
was supposed to air—
Jenny:
Mmhmm.
Kristin:
On March 18th, 2003, so that it came before
the episode Orpheus, where
Willow actually gets to Los Angeles, which is where she’s going. But it was
postponed due to a small thing, which is just that the Iraq war began. Um, so—
Jenny:
Ahh!
Kristin:
Yeah. Fucking—I remember that day. I remember
that day. And it moved
to the 25th? So we saw it out of order, but luckily, we are so particular about
everything, that we are also airing our episode after the episode Orpheus aired in
the Angel on Top feed. So you’re welcome. [both laugh]
Jenny:
Indeed. Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
Giles can’t believe they
removed Spike’s chip. Buffy believes Spike can be a good man. Robin’s mom was a
Slayer who was killed by a vampire, oh no, that vampire was Spike. Oh no, Robin
recognizes his mom’s coat that Spike still wears.
Kristin:
Dun-dun-dun! You know, you can tell by the
Previously Ons when it’s
gonna be a nice tight little episode. You know? Like, they were like, here’s all you
need to know. Spike, Giles, Robin, Nikki, go. And you’re like, okay, we’re gonna
focus in here, people! We’re not gonna try to—
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
Talk about all of the fucking mythology and
all of the history of everyone
on the show, all at once. Hallelujah.
Jenny:
Yeah. Yeah.
Kristin:
Speaking of which, New York City, 1977.
Jenny:
Oh my god. Peak punk rock Spike.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
Studs, leather.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
Probably listening to the Sex Pistols.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
Eugh.
Kristin:
My parents are somewhere in the same city
as Spike and Nikki, working at,
like, MetLife. So.
Jenny:
Wow.
Kristin:
Yeah, they’re just there. They’re just hanging—maybe
they rode the
subway together a couple of times. [both laugh] My mom definitely would have had
a crush on Spike, no questions. No questions.
Jenny:
Oh. So—
Kristin:
Wow, Spike could’ve been my dad. Okay, anyway,
go on. [both laugh]
Jenny:
Uhh…’kay. So, here’s something we learn in
this episode. We see Nikki and
Spike fighting, but Nikki is not on patrol alone.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
She’s got little sweet, tiny, baby Robin with
her, hiding behind a park bench.
Wahh!
Kristin:
This is a Central Park bench. Like, clearly
they didn’t shoot it in Central
Park, but it just has—they did enough research for me to be like—
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
Yeah, that works. Looks like a Central Park bench. [laughs] So I’m gonna
imagine that’s where they are. Maybe Riverside Park. I’ll allow for Riverside Central
Park, but it’s in—[Jenny laughs] I think we’re on the island of Manhattan.
Jenny:
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kristin:
Right? And yeah, Spike is fighting Nikki.
I don’t think this is the first time,
and we know it’s not the last time. Right? Did you get the sense—it feels like
they’ve sort of done this dance before this moment.
Jenny:
I thought this felt like their first, and that…
Kristin:
It was a “to be continued”?
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Based on what—based on—yeah.
Based on what Spike
says at the end of their little fight, it seems like this is the first, he was looking for
her for a long time.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
And he is, uh, excited to draw it out for as
long as possible, really get his
money’s worth.
Kristin:
Yeah. Lot of really icky things said here,
which are nicely batted back by
Nikki. Spike, talking about riding Nikki hard before he puts her away. [Jenny grunts
uncomfortably] Which he means fighting, but we all know why this line was written
this way.
Jenny:
Yes.
Kristin:
It’s not cool. But Nikki: “You sure about
that? You look a little wet and
limp.” Which is a really—she doesn’t even know how deep of a fucking dig that is.
Because his own fucking mother used the word “limp”—
Jenny:
Mm, mmhmm.
Kristin:
Before he fucking slayed her. We’ll get into
all that soon.
Jenny:
Early signs of demon-fighting aptitude, at
a critical moment when Spike is
about to [Kristin laughs] win the fight, Robin distracts him by shoving a trashcan
over.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
Oh, good job, Robin!
Kristin:
Yeah, good job, Robin. He’s so—Tiny Robin
is so cute.
Jenny:
He’s so cute.
Kristin:
Yeah, a couple of things up at the top here.
One—
Jenny:
We, like, never see children on this show.
Kristin:
Ever. Except for that one episode, Der Kinderstadt.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] I can’t remember—from the
MOO episode. [both laugh]
Kristin:
No!
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Oh, Der Kinderstadt and the
MOO episode.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Der Kinderstadt. Yeah. And
the—and any episode where
we get Tiny Buffy with her fucking doll, which is always—
Jenny:
Oh, right, right, right.
Kristin:
Creeps me out. Okay, so, first of all, I
just wanna ring a little toxic
masculinity bell here at the top of the fucking episode with Spike. [laughs] Actually,
we kind of have a bell for that. The patriarchy and toxic masculinity go hand in
hand, right?
[THE PATRIARCHY jingle plays]
The patriarchy! [thunder clap, evil laughter]
Kristin:
Yeah, I mean, I just feel—and we’ll get into
it when we actually get to
these places—but like, Spike—clearly, there’s a lot of mommy issues here that
we’ve been talking about, wrapped into powerful women issues. Wrapped into him
feeling like he’s not been a powerful, strong man, and overcompensating for that in
his vamp form—there’s just a lot of, like, gender fucking shit here, exploding in a
toxic masculinity way. So. Hey, Spike. Your problematic fave since 1888. When was
he born? [both laugh] And then, the other thing I wanted to talk about is after this
last part of the scene. So, Jenny, I don’t know if you wanted to talk about after the
garbage can is knocked.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Well…I think it’s good to
note that Spike takes note of the
coat and says he loves it. We all know later, he will obtain it for himself.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
This conversation where Robin—little baby Robin
is like, “Can we go home
now?” And Nikki’s like, “No.”
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
She offers to take him to Crowley’s house.
Her Watcher.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] For spooky doodads!
Jenny:
I’m like, when does Crowley make the move from
New York City to Beverly
Hills?
Kristin:
Yeah. Probably after he—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Where we know Robin grew up.
Kristin:
‘Cause he retires. Right? He—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Right. Yeah, okay, so maybe
later in 1977.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
Nikki tells Robin: “Always gotta work the mission.
You know I love you, but
I got a job to do. The mission is what matters.”
Kristin:
Yeah. So…
Jenny:
This is—I can’t imagine—I mean, I can’t imagine
a lot of things. I can’t even
imagine being a vampire slayer, hard stop. But to be a vampire slayer and also—
Kristin:
[simultaneously] And a parent. [laughs]
Jenny:
Have—yeah. You know?
Kristin:
A single parent.
Jenny:
A single parent. Here’s something.
Kristin:
Mmm.
Jenny:
Yet another thing. While we, the Watchers’
Council, are busy taking our own
salaries but never compensating a Slayer—
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Mmhmm.
Jenny:
For putting her life on the line, let’s also
definitely not supply childcare?
[laughs]
Kristin:
Mmhmm. Oh, yeah right. Yeah fucking right!
They don’t even get a salary.
Childcare? What a fucking joke. Are you kidding? I’m sure that not only do they not
give fucking Nikki childcare of any kind, but they probably also didn’t give Crowley
a goddamn fucking penny. And he probably just took in Robin of his own accord.
Like, you know—
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
That there was no support whatsoever in—there’s
never been any support
in this system. And I think, like—you know, and this will come into the conversation
in many ways throughout the episode. But like, this is a single, Black woman raising
a son, trying to also at the same time, save the world. Okay? So like—
Jenny:
Mmhmm.
Kristin:
Just in that sentence, you can see how there’s
some shit packed in here
that, like, probably deserved more exploration. And certainly did not deserve, in my
macro opinion—and I think in many people’s macro opinions—the treatment that it
gets here. Because this line that you said, Jenny: “Always gotta work the mission.
You know I love you, but I got a job to do. The mission is what matters, right?” is
used in the rest of the episode as a tool to say that Nikki was putting the mission
first, ahead of Robin, her son. And it is never challenged by anyone, including the
character of Robin as written on the page. And it’s so fucked up—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Yeah.
Kristin:
So fucked up. At one point, he’s like, you
know, your mom chose to, like,
basically do this. And it’s like, all she really had the choice to do was walk away
from the job that had been given to her. She did not ask to be a Slayer. No one who
has been a Slayer has asked to be a Slayer, [laughs] okay? So the fact that, like,
this is—this was what she was dealt and she’s doing her fucking best, supporting
her kid, patroling, trying to fucking keep us all safe, including her son? Ooh, I am
so mad! I am just so fucking mad.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Yeah, I can’t even with what
Spike gets up to at the end of
the episode.
Kristin:
Spike—right, and like, clearly there’s a
lot of things—there’s a lot of, like,
specific ridiculous shit that happens. But just this idea that—and most of this
episode. This—we get this flashback that includes Wood, but like, for the most part,
almost all the flashbacks are just Spike’s history with his mom. Like, we get this
full, full, detailed picture of all of the nuances of relationship that are happening
there. And we get, like, this little, like, boop!
Jenny:
Tiny little snip.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Little deep! Of Robin and
Nikki. And yeah, so I just—you
know, not to come out swinging, but also, my name is Kristin Noeline Russo, so. It’s
kinda my deal.
Jenny:
Yep.
Kristin:
[laughs] This is a really cool transition
to Adult Robin. I think. Before we go
to the alley. Like, Baby Robin—
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Goes back in the rain, in
his little boots!
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Awww. To pick up the stake!
And then cut to the present
and Robin also has a stake in his head. He’s out with Buffy and Spike, doing a little
patrol. Robin is in danger and then Spike stakes the vampire that’s attacking him
from behind with a shovel handle that doesn’t seem to me like it’s been sharpened,
so—
Kristin:
[laughing] No—
Jenny:
Think about the amount of pressure…?
Kristin:
[simultaneously] [laughs] Brute strength,
yeah.
Jenny:
Horrifying—that would be required to puncture, like, an undead body
[laughs] with a blunt shovel handle. Spike’s all like, “Don’t be afraid to use the
stake.” [laughs] And as he walks away—this is a silly thing. To me.
Kristin:
It’s really goofy.
Jenny:
We see Robin’s hand and he’s squeezing the
stake so hard that his
little—his hand is bleeding.
Kristin:
It’s so goofy. It’s so goofy.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] This seems impractical. It’s
gonna negatively impact your
stake usage and deployment in the future. Just doesn’t seem—oh, wait. But does
this mean Robin is left-handed?
Kristin:
Ooooh!
Jenny:
I don’t know why that’s hot to me, but here
we are.
Kristin:
It’s hot to me too. Why?
Jenny:
I don’t know.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Write to us at bufferingthevampireslayer@gmail.com
of
why we think left-handedness is hot.
Jenny:
Has this ever happened to you? [laughs] We
wanna hear your story.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] It’s probably just because
we’re queer, and
left-handedness is definitely the queer handedness. [laughs]
Jenny:
Oh, true, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kristin:
You know? A couple of things. One, just something
that I noticed and I was
proud of myself ‘cause usually I read continuity things or, like, whatever. Not
continuity, but like, flubs—in the filming. And I didn’t read this, I just saw it. When
Robin gets thrown up on top of the garbage cans, he has the stake in his left hand.
And it falls. And in the next cut, he’s on the ground, and he’s got the stake back in
his hand. So it’s not a big deal.
Jenny:
Mmhmm.
Kristin:
The only big deal is that I saw it by myself without any help.
Jenny:
[laughs] Congratulations.
Kristin:
Thank you. Okay, so, way later in the episode,
we’re gonna have a little
snip of a conversation that Alba had with our listener, Charlie Peppers. And it is
gonna talk about a couple of things, but this idea of Wood being the character who
does not have control over his emotions and is acting just, like, purely on
adrenaline and vengeance and can’t see straight. Versus Spike, who is, like, able to
process his stuff and clearly move forward and duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh. It’s
sort of set up here, right? Spike is, like, so calm.
Jenny:
This seems so backwards when we think about
the fact that—
Kristin:
Yes!
Jenny:
Spike is recently re-ensouled. He’s, like,
surging with feelings and memories
and things that he hasn’t had to deal with, you know, in a hundred years.
Kristin:
[laughing] Yes!
Jenny:
And Robin has been, like, slowly, methodically
maneuvering himself into
this position—
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
For his whole life, essentially.
Kristin:
Yeah. Yeah.
Jenny:
It just—yeah, it definitely—[laughs]
Kristin:
It’s off.
Jenny:
Feels like somebody made a whoopsie.
Kristin:
Yeah. At least—it’s just taken too far. So
Spike says, “Don’t be afraid to use
it,” and in this moment that Jenny just described, fucking, the camera, like, zoo—it
doesn’t really. But in my imagination, the camera zooms in on Wood’s face, and he’s
like, “Just waiting for my moment,” ba-ba-bum! Credits. [Jenny laughs] So
overdramatic, so unnecessary. Give us—give us the nuance of story! The name of
the show is Buffy the Vampire Slayer. That’s the point.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
[sighs] Oh my god, oh my god. Actually, perfect,
out of the credits to more
melodrama. Which actually was kind of—is kind of funny, because we immediately
go from that drama to, once again, Wood pulling down a miniblind and peeking out.
[both laugh]
Jenny:
He’s like, I’ve seen this show before and if
there’s one way I know to access
drama within it, it’s to really work the miniblind angle.
Kristin:
God. He’s like, “If I can’t have Angel lighting,
I’ll at least work the
miniblinds in my own way.”
Jenny:
Indeed.
Kristin:
School has calmed down, right? We just came
out of Storyteller, where
there was a full war happening at the school. But then the seal was closed, and now
things are back to normal. The swing choir and the marching band have gone back,
Buffy says, to their normal, healthy seething resentment. [both laugh]
Jenny:
I love this sort of, like—what I think is positioned
for us as, like, this really
intense nerd rivalry—[laughs]
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
Between—is there anything wrong with marching
band? No. I was in it.
[Kristin laughs] For one game. Is there anything wrong with swing choir? I don’t
even know what swing choir is, but sounds fun. [Kristin laughs] But I know that
we’re supposed to be like, OMG, nerds. Full of venom for one another.
Kristin:
Yeah. [laughs]
Jenny:
Hard to imagine.
Kristin:
So. Oh my god, this scene has a lot to give
us, actually. I think that this is
a—like, from top to bottom, it’s really a very fun scene for me. First, we get a little
emotional—a little emotional moment between Robin and Buffy. I’m gonna use
“Robin” when I feel things are getting heated.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Ohhh, my god! [Kristin laughs]
Eeee!
Kristin:
So. Buffy is basically like, LOL, you think that’s how the apocalypse ends?
Buddy, I didn’t even break a sweat yet. We’re just getting started. And Robin
is—like, just takes a moment. And—and the fact that this show delivers this to us
and it actually works is remarkable. He starts to say, “You remind me of my—” and
Buffy says, “Your mother.” And acknowledges, like, normally, this would be a thing
that, like, wouldn’t be fun to hear. But in this particular case, it’s quite nice. And it
is, it’s—it feels very nice.
Jenny:
This. Is. Hot.
Kristin:
Kiss!
Jenny:
This. Is. Hot. Kiss!
Kristin:
Kiss each other, you motherfucker—give me
the writers’ room! I will lock
the door to this writers’ room and not let anybody out until they kiss! [laughs]
Jenny:
Let Robin and Buffy do a smooch, you cowards!
Kristin:
God. So Buffy’s like, “Maybe you’re right,
Robin. Like, maybe everything
will be okay after all. Maybe everything is fine.” And then Giles walks in.
[Clip from episode plays]
G i l e s :
Everything’s terrible! A total catastrophe.
B u f f y :
Giles, what’s wrong?
G i l e s :
Have you seen the new library? There’s nothing
but computers!
There’s not a book to be seen! I-I don’t know where to begin, Buffy. I-I-I
mean, who do—who do we speak to?
Jenny:
Thank god we get one nice moment with Giles
in this episode. [laughs]
Kristin:
Yeah, a solid point. Giles is a fucking piece
of colonialism bullshit
[laughing] this whole episode.
Jenny:
Yeah, he’s really letting us down in a lot
of ways.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Patriarchal, colonialist
bullshit. His way is right. His way
or the highway, buddy. But before we get there, let’s have fun with Giles, yes.
Jenny:
“Knowledge comes from crafted pages and bindings, not ones and zeroes.”
Oh, Giles.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Fucking burn on Neo, over
here. [laughs]
Jenny:
Wow. But also just, I mean—I guess this episode
came out at a transitional
point in information history. But like, bro. [laughs]
Kristin:
Well—
Jenny:
You’re gonna gatekeep info and how it can be
communicated? The sharing
of knowledge?
Kristin:
Yeah. Well, that’s the thing too, is like,
in the context especially of this
episode, it’s—the spotlight is really here on, like, oh, so you think that only people
who have books in their hands can fucking learn anything, buddy? But—
Jenny:
Uh-huh.
Kristin:
If you take away that little—that lens for
a moment, the joke was written
because it’s to make Giles this old stodgy dude who can only, like, get his material
from written books and is very afraid of the internet and, like, that idea.
Jenny:
Right.
Kristin:
Also, listen, as a person who likes to hold
a book in my hands and not a
Kindle—
Jenny:
Sure!
Kristin:
I—you know, I also have some feelings here.
I think a book is very—the
ending of fucking the new Little Women when they have the whole book binding
scene? Fuck me up. That shit was the sexiest thing I’ve seen on a movie screen in
my whole life. Have you not seen it?
Jenny:
No, I just saw the first Little Women for the
first time.
Kristin:
The new one is pretty good and the—um, the
ending—even if you don’t
watch the new Little Women, you should watch the last scene where they book is
bound, ‘cause it’s really fucking sexy. Okay, so. In this slapstick fucking scene. First
of all, we learn that Giles knows what’s up. Well, he doesn’t know everything that’s
up, but he knows that Wood is a freelance demon fighter. The seers—who’s paying
the coven? Also. I would like for Buffy Summers to get paid and for the coven to get
paid. These seers are literally doing all of the lifting in this episode—in this season
of television. [laughs]
Jenny:
Mmhmm.
Kristin:
They have let us know that the First is continuing
to gather its forces.
[Jenny laughs] War is inevitable. [laughs] Are you laughing at Giles’ next line?
Jenny:
No, I’m just laughing at the seers, the MVP
of Season 7. [both laugh]
Kristin:
Well, then the next line that Giles says
is, “We should go before the school
board.” Right after he says, “War is inevitable.” And everyone’s like, wait, what? And
he’s like, “Because of the library! I’ll send my backup library from home in the
meantime.” [both laugh] And then we go into this fucking chip, soul, trigger—
Jenny:
Yeah. Who’s on first.
Kristin:
Yes.
Jenny:
Chip’s on first, trigger’s on second, soul’s
on third. [Kristin laughs]
[Clip from episode plays]
W o o d :
Wait, sorry, chip?
G i l e s
: Uh, it's a long story.
B u f f y
: The military put a chip in Spike's head so
he couldn't hurt anyone.
G i l e s
: And that would be the abridged version.
B u f f y
: But he wouldn't hurt anyone anymore because
he has a soul now.
G i l e s
: Unless the First triggers him again.
W o o d
: Triggers the chip?
B u f f y
: No, the trigger's a post-hypnotic thing. The
First put it in his head. It
was—made him—he was killing again.
W o o d
: So, he has a trigger, a soul, and a chip?
G i l e s
: Not anymore.
B u f f y
: It was killing him, Giles!
W o o d
: The trigger?
B u f f y
: No, the chip. The trigger's not active anymore.
W o o d
: Because the military gave him a soul?
Jenny:
Someone send Robin the DVD boxsets of Buffy
the Vampire Slayer, seasons
1 through 6, stat. [both laugh]
Kristin:
Yeah. Yeah. He really—honestly, he only needs,
like, Season 4, 5 and 6 to
get this information.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,
but in order to get all the
character background and all the, like, really emotional stuff. [laughs] All the
payoff, the growth.
Kristin:
You know what we—
Jenny:
He should start from the beginning.
Kristin:
Honestly, you know what would make me like
Riley?
Jenny:
What?
Kristin:
If Wood and Riley had some time together.
Jenny:
Oh my god!
Kristin:
Now, that I could get into. So. Buffy knows
that the trigger is this song,
but nobody knows what the fuck the song is. And Giles lied about where he was
going, or at least wasn’t clear about it. Because he actually was not going to get a
Potential. He was going to get something for Spike. Specifically, something for
Spike’s optical nerve. [laughs] Which we’ll learn later.
Jenny:
Yeah. So Giles asks if Buffy can remember anything
about the song that
they’ve identified must be the trigger that’s setting Spike into evil action. And she’s
like, “It wasn’t like it had a catchy hook or anything. It wasn’t like, I’m coming up
so you better get this party started. [Kristin starts singing in the background] It
was boring, old and English, just like you…Yule Brenner. Yule Brenner!”
Kristin:
It’s good. I gave you backup track. Did you
like that?
Jenny:
I appreciate that. [both laugh] It’s nice to
be supported.
Kristin:
I mean, she’s not wrong. That song does have
a catchy hook.
Jenny:
I think Early One Morning is pretty catchy,
but—
Kristin:
It is. I agree. I think that Early One Morning
is also pretty catchy. [laughs]
Jenny:
So, into the basement.
Kristin:
Shoulda left those fucking chains up. We
said it. If we said it once, we’ve
said it a million times. Keep the chains…up.
Jenny:
Xander says, noo, we couldn’t have put these
chains up a week ago when
he could have used them! Well, maybe now that they’re up again—
Kristin:
All you want is for Anya and Xander to keep
fucking. End of the world sex.
Jenny:
End of the world sex!
Kristin:
God. Anya is—I’m sorry. It’s not even here
yet, but you saying Anya just
made me remember that she’s wearing the most insane hat I’ve ever seen a human
wear, in this episode. It’s like a little condom cap.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
It’s like a little purple condom cap. [laughs]
Jenny:
Yeah, lots of—I feel like things are weird
on Emma Caulfield’s head, this
season.
Kristin:
Yeah. Yeah.
Jenny:
You know?
Kristin:
Yeah. Emma Caulfield deserved better from
the costuming department.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
So, um, Dawn and Buffy are here. Later, we
do learn that Willow is here,
but at first, we don’t see her. And Wood is here, why? Why—I agree. Why would
Wood possibly be here for this?
Jenny:
He’s part of the squad now?
Kristin:
It seems…like a lot.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] And he’s making sure he’s
at every major Spike-related
event. [laughs]
Kristin:
Yeah, I guess he—I guess that’s why. So we
learn—
Jenny:
More weird antagonistic vibes between Spike
and Robin. You’d think this
alone would get Robin barred from Spike-related events. [laughs]
Kristin:
I know. I know. I mean, I understand—
Jenny:
It just seems like a bad vibe to keep putting
them in the same room
together.
Kristin:
Yeah. So Giles reveals that there is a prok—how
do you say it?
Prok—prok—he says it, and the only reason I know how to spell it is ‘cause I got it
from the captions. But now that I spelled it out, I don’t remember how he said it.
Prokaryote stone. Pro—pro-kar—[Jenny laughs] and the thing that really fucks me
up with this word is that it’s a real word. When I was typing it in to text Jenny my
Sexual Tension Award contenders—
Jenny:
Mmm.
Kristin:
I don’t know if that one will make it in,
but when I was typing it in, Siri was
like, “Do you mean Prokaryote?” And I was like, how the fuck does Siri know this
goddamn word? Which made me google it, which made me learn that this word that
I can’t pronounce is a single-celled organism that lacks a nucleus and other
membrane-bound organelles.
Jenny:
Wow! Organelles.
Kristin:
Yeah, it’s a real—organelles. [Jenny makes
snare drum beat in
background] That’s right, you heard it here first. [laughs]
Jenny:
Wow.
Kristin:
Those are probably lady organs, if I understand
how language works.
[laughs]
Jenny:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. [laughs]
Kristin:
When a man has an organ, it’s an organ, but
when a lady has an organ,
it’s an organelle. [laughs]
Jenny:
Or an organette.
Kristin:
Yeah. [laughs]
Jenny:
So this thing is, like, a stone until Willow
says a spell and then it’s like a
slug, and it goes inside Spike’s…head.
Kristin:
This is—[shudders] woof. Hate it.
Jenny:
Oh my god. Right before it goes in. [laughing]
Spike says, “With all the
stuff everyone keeps shoving into my head, it’s a wonder there’s any room for my
brain.” And Giles, giving us his one other good thing for this episode—
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
Says, “I don’t think it takes up that much
space. Do you?”
Kristin:
But also, like, the way that Giles says this,
it’s—the reason that we like it is
because it indicates a history of relationship between them. Like, that’s—
Jenny:
Oh, yeah.
Kristin:
That’s what’s—
Jenny:
Yeah, remember when they were
r o o m m a t e s ?
Kristin:
Yes! And remember when Giles was able to
understand that there’s a gray
area between the evil and good? Like, that’s what fucks me up. And I noted this
moment specifically for that reason, is like, yes, this is the Giles that we know.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
Who is understanding that Spike—this is complicated
and that, like, Buffy
might need to challenge herself in particular areas, sure. But that, like, also, we
should trust Buffy to appoint and also we should fucking allow for people to be
more than one thing. And Giles usually knows that. Anyway.
Jenny:
Yeah. So.
Kristin:
[laughs] Please just let us say “bug ugly”
before we go anywhere else. I
just wanna make sure that “bug ugly” is included. That is what Spike—
Jenny:
Please, go ahead.
Kristin:
[laughs] Spike says, “How am I supposed to
know if this bug ugly is doing
its job?”
Jenny:
[laughs] Well, Spike, I think you’ll know because
you’ll suddenly be
watching your own personal history, and so will we. We are at Pratt House. William’s
last name is Pratt, and his mother is named Anne.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
And get a load of this, Kristin, if you will.
British slang. You’ve heard of it.
Prat is British slang for a person that chatters or utters childishly or foolishly.
Kristin:
Oh, wow.
Jenny:
Based on how this episode progresses, it feels
like this was a specific
choice. A deliberate choice.
Kristin:
Yeah, well, and you know that her first name
is Anne deliberately. That was
a deliberate choice, because it’s Buffy’s middle name. And this actress was
hired—this is Caroline—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Ugh. I—this is so fucking
gross. To me.
Kristin:
Yeah. But—but I mean—but also, that’s the
whole poi—they have made
this gross. They’ve—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Yeah, okay. Yeah, please finish
the sentence. Sorry, I
didn’t mean to—
Kristin:
They all know where I’m going. Caroline Lagerfelt—I think is how you say
this actress’s name. And she was literally hired because of how much she looked
like Sarah Michelle Gellar. Like, they wanted this overlap of—they wanted to
go—they wanted to really double down on mommy issues here. Which I agree, I
think it’s a—it’s really a lot. Can I just say a couple of things about this actress?
Jenny:
Yeah, please.
Kristin:
So. First of all, this is a bad-ass actress.
Television wise, she is known most
for Gossip Girl, a show that I have not seen, to LaToya’s deep disappointment.
[Jenny laughs] She was also in an episode of The X-Files, Jenny. She played Rustic
Woman—
Jenny:
Nice!
Kristin:
[simultaneously] In an episode called The
Gift. And she was in 90210, the
original, as Sheila Silver. This is David Silver’s mom.
Jenny:
Mmmm.
Kristin:
But past that, she is a major theater human,
which is so exciting to me,
knowing James’ theater history.
Jenny:
Yeah, yeah.
Kristin:
That the two of them—because she has, like,
won an Outer Critics Circle
award, an Obie award, fucking nominated for a Drama Desk. She has been in nine
Broadway shows.
Jenny:
Wow.
Kristin:
She was in fucking—like, literally. The Prime
of Miss Jean Brodie opposite
Cynthia Nixon. She was in The Constant Wife with Ingrid Bergman and a
then-unknown Sigourney Weaver. Like, this lady has fucking—
Jenny:
Wow.
Kristin:
Done some serious acting. [laughs] And, like,
would be exciting no matter
what, but I just thought, ooh, how fun, that like, James was a stage actor and
Caroline is a stage actor and they get to do these, like—
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
Fucked up scenes together.
Jenny:
Very cool. So, when we enter the scene, we
see William reading poetry to
his mother. [Kristin laughs] And she’s all like, “oh, this—[laughs] this Cecily you’re
always writing poems about.” Is that—I assume—the only Cecily in town? [both
laugh]
Kristin:
The vengeance demon Cecily, is that who you
mean? [both laugh]
Jenny:
And she’s like, “Oh, it’d be so great if you
had a woman in your life.” And
he’s like, “I
h a v e
a woman in my life.” Oh, boy!
Kristin:
Oh, boy.
Jenny:
Then she coughs some blood into a handkerchief
and Spike asks if he
should call Dr. Gull. This appears to be, according to the Wikia, the—a reference to
Sir William Gull, who was a physician, attended the family of Queen Victoria, and
who was one of several prominent Jack the Ripper suspects.
Kristin:
Yeah, good thing Dr. Gull didn’t come our
way, you know what I’m saying?
Coulda been short one kidney by the end of the day.
Jenny:
[laughs] Indeed. William sits down on the floor,
next to Anne, and she
starts singing Early One Morning to him. Ah-ha!
Kristin:
Ah-ha!
Jenny:
A root!
Kristin:
Oh, no. His eyes change from past William
to present Spike. Vampire—
Jenny:
Yeah, he wolfs out.
Kristin:
Oh, man, he—
Jenny:
I mean, technically he vampires out, but it’s
a lot more fun to say wolfs out.
Go on.
Kristin:
He attacks Buffy. He throws the bed, which
hits Dawn. The worm wiggles
out of his fucking eye as he’s, like, fighting against the chains. Buffy and Spike
make a moment of eye contact, of like, oh, that was fucked up. That was fucked up,
right? That was fucked up. And then we zoom in on Wood, who’s still mad and full
of vengeance-y feelings.
Jenny:
Yeah. Good thing he’s not holding a stake right
now.
Kristin:
Just every act of the show, before the commercial,
ends with him gripping
the stake—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] [laughing] Yeah, yeah.
Kristin:
Again and bleeding. [laughs]
Jenny:
So this is weird. Spike and Buffy, like, their
attitude is just sort of like,
Spike should be unchained immediately.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
And this feels in complete conflict with, like,
everything both of them have
done and said in this season, up till now?
Kristin:
I agree. I have a little room for Spike,
just given that he’s, like, I think,
overwhelmed with what he’s just, like, seen. And we don’t know, at this point, what
he’s remembering, but we know—you know—later, that he’s remembering fucking
killing his mom after he’d sired his mom. So, like—
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
For him to be like, “Get me out of these
fucking chains,” I have a little
room for. But normally, he would not be like that at all, having just vamped out and
hurt Dawn and almost hurt Buffy. But Buffy wouldn’t. Hard stop.
Jenny:
Yeah. Yeah. And he tells the group that he
heard early—that Early One
Morning, the song, was in his dream, vision, experience?
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
And Robin’s like, “What does it mean to you?”
Kristin:
[laughs] This is a funny delivery from James.
He says, [laughing] “My mom
used to sing it to me. When I was a baby.” He’s, like, so embarrassed!
Jenny:
Aw, yeah, definitely not when I was a grown man reading her my poetry.
[both laugh]
Kristin:
He’s just, like, so self conscious of, like,
ever having been not Spike. You
know? A baby.
Jenny:
Yeah, yeah.
Kristin:
[flatly] “A baby.” [both laugh]
Jenny:
Up in the living room, Kennedy, Rona and Anya
are talking about, like,
what’s up with Buffy letting Spike live with us, with an active trigger? And Anya’s
like, “He gets this, like, get out of jail free card. [Kristin laughs] He could slaughter,
like, a hundred frat guys. And, uh, anyway, forgiveness, an important pillar of
humanity.” [laughs]
Kristin:
God. Emma Caulfield. I mean, she’s literally
got, like, one line in the whole
episode and it is one of my favorite lines of the whole episode.
Jenny:
It is good.
Kristin:
Yes. Making the good point that everyone
on this show has been evil at
one point. [laughs]
Jenny:
Uh-huh.
Kristin:
How can we trust anyone?
Jenny:
Mmhmm.
Kristin:
Rona, solid point. Kennedy, solid point.
These ladies have solid points. I do
not—I do not think that Spike should—I do not think that Spike should just be
chillin’ wherever the fuck Spike wants to chill. And not because I think that he’s not
a good man, but rather because of everything we’re saying here. He has a fucking
trigger implanted by the First. And we know the First is just waiting to use it, at the
opportune moment.
Jenny:
Yeah, just—
Kristin:
Come on, guys.
Jenny:
Just seems, like, very reasonable—
Kristin:
Yes.
Jenny:
To take precautions against that.
Kristin:
Ring-a-ding-ding! [both laugh]
Jenny:
Go on.
Kristin:
The phone’s ringing, Jenny.
Jenny:
Oh, yeah! Andrew has a call for Willow, from
an effeminate guy named
Fred. [both laugh] Oh my god, we know a guy named Fred. She lives in Los Angeles
with Angel.
Kristin:
Her full name is Winifred, in fact.
Jenny:
Those of you all who are not watching Angel
and listening to Angel on Top,
here’s an example of you missing out. [laughs]
Kristin:
Yeah. Yeah. If you’re—honestly, if you’re
not, you should be. Because I will
say, getting to go from Lies My Parents Told Me to Orpheus to Dirty Girls is a good
time. [Jenny laughs] Okay, so. In the basement. Spike’s still saying there is not
anything I am not telling you. I understand that, like, Spike is having some issues
with the reality of his past, and like, facing these things. But I really wanna believe
that Spike is at a point where he would have either stayed chained to the wall, or
spoken his truth.
Jenny:
Yeah, I don’t know. I feel like—we get the
rest of what he sees, like,
sprinkled throughout the episode. And I’m not entirely convinced that he just saw
all of it or understood all of it.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Ohhhh. Ohhhh.
Jenny:
If he did see all of it. You know?
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Well, that gives me more
room, then. If like, weird—
Jenny:
I think let’s roll with that interpretation,
because I think it’s supported later
when he’s like, “I just realized something.”
Kristin:
Right, right, right.
Jenny:
Okay, so. Buffy wants to unchain him. They
go upstairs.
Kristin:
[laughs] She refers to the stone as the prophylactic
stone, which is good.
[laughs]
Jenny:
Which is what we should just call it.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
And then we get this little quick confirmation
from Robin and Giles. The
trigger is still in effect.
Kristin:
Yes. And then we go to a flashback with whomst?
[DRUSILLA jingle plays]
Dru...silla
You...fill up
My heart with dread
And still I’m led
Right back to you
Jenny:
Well! Back at Pratt house with Drusilla. And
William. They are dancing in
the—let’s call it a sitting room. And Dru’s like, [imitating Dru] “Ah, it smells of
viscera and daffodil—” Why did I say it like that? It smells of viscera and daffodils,
she said. [Kristin laughs] I cannot access the way that she speaks. They make out
on the couch.
Kristin:
Specifically, she says daffodils and viscera.
I feel like it’s important that
viscera comes second.
Jenny:
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. [Kristin laughs] And
Spike’s like, aw, yeah, this is
gonna rule—excuse me. William is like, [Kristin laughs] “aw, yeah, this is gonna
rule. We’ll run this town! The world is ours. Just the three of us!” [Kristin laughing]
And Dru’s like, “Wait, what?” And he’s like, “Yes, you, me and Mother!” [laughs] And
Dru’s like, uhh, you can—my notes say, you can hear the sound of Drusilla’s vagina
drying up.
Kristin:
[laughing] Oh my god, Jenny!
Jenny:
Forgive me for being so crass, but it’s there.
It’s actually in the closed
captioning. [Kristin laughs] And she’s like, “You wanna bring your mum with us? On
our bloodthirsty tear that we’re about to go on across the land,
drinking—slurp-slurping and fucking all over Europe? You want your mom to come?”
Kristin:
I love this so much because Drusilla has
never had a predictable response
to anything, as long as we’ve known her. And this is, like, the—
Jenny:
Until now.
Kristin:
Until right now. Like, the universal response
to “you’re bringing your mom
with us?” is what? [laughs] Hell no.
Jenny:
[laughs] In comes the—I was gonna say the titular
mother, but she’s not.
She would have been…[Kristin laughs] a titular mother, if the original episode title
had stayed.
Kristin:
Yes.
Jenny:
But in comes Anne Pratt. She’s been worried
sick about William. He’s maybe
been gone for a few days, which is probably the longest she’s ever gone without
laying eyes upon him.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
And Dru’s like, what’s up? I’m the other person
who gave birth to your son.
High five, bring it in, Annie.
Kristin:
[laughing] She doesn’t even say “person.”
She says, “I’m the other that
gave birth to your son.” [laughs]
Jenny:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh my gosh, and then, William
explains. He’s like, “That
feeling when you have become a creature of the night. Comma. A vampire.” [both
laugh]
Kristin:
He’s a baby vamp. He’s just a little baby.
Jenny:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He’s like, “It’s gonna be
amazing. You’ll never be sick,
you’ll never age. Let me just turn you into a vampire.” And here is a point that,
Kristin, you might already be familiar with, from Anne Rice. The vampire Lestat’s
mother was suffering from tuberculosis and was the first vampire sired by Lestat—
Kristin:
Mmm.
Jenny:
As well. How do you like them apples?
Kristin:
There’s a lot of—you know, I don’t know that
I remembered specifically
that. But I definitely have an association in my mind with, like, plague times and
tuberculosis times and vampirism. Like, it feels like—because wasn’t Darla also
sired when she was dying of some…?
Jenny:
I think she was dying of, like—I thought she
was dying of, like, syphilis?
Kristin:
Okay, but like, you know what I mean? Like,
it just feels like…in olden
times—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] [laughs] Olden times?
Kristin:
In olden times—
Jenny:
Olden times.
Kristin:
You could go to Dr. Gull. [laughs]
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Oh, Claudia in—in Interview
with a Vampire, when Louis
finds Claudia—
Kristin:
Right.
Jenny:
Before Lestat turns her, she is—her mother
has died of the plague and she’s
with the body.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
Of her mother, when they find her.
Kristin:
So just—I’m just saying. In olden times,
you could get sick and die, or you
could get sick and become a vampire, you know? Like, those were your two options.
Which would you choose, Jenny?
Jenny:
Vampire.
Kristin:
[laughs] No hesitation whatsoever.
Jenny:
What? Yeah, I’m gonna die when I could, like,
not? [both laugh] What are
we talking about here? What are you gonna pick?
Kristin:
Well, I mean, probably I’d wind up at vampire,
but I feel like I’d be
weighing a lot of, like, forever.
Jenny:
Well, no, but consider—
Kristin:
[simultaneously] I guess I could always just
stake myself when I was done
with it.
Jenny:
Kristin. Think about it. If we’re talking about
being served this choice in
olden times, you wouldn’t have read a bunch of Anne Rice novels—
Kristin:
True. True. True, true.
Jenny:
And you wouldn’t have watched a bunch of vampire
movies and television.
Kristin:
True.
Jenny:
So you wouldn’t be like, oh, I’ve seen, you
know, how sometimes it goes
badly for a vampire.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
All you would know is that you would live forever
and not age. [laughs]
Kristin:
Okay, fine. Vampire! [laughs] Alright, so—
Jenny:
Seems the only choice, to me.
Kristin:
[laughs] His mom is like, “Are you drunk?”
And he’s like, “A little bit.”
[laughs]
Jenny:
Yeah, that’s beside the point, Mom.
Kristin:
Yeah. My last note for this scene is “puke.”
He says, “We’ll be together
forever. It only hurts for a moment,” and then he bites his mom. And we have been
trained, for seasons, to witness siring as doin’ it. And so I cannot with this. I don’t
like it, I didn’t wanna see it, I would like to unsee it. It’s not okay. Goodbye.
Jenny:
Yeah, just moving forward quickly…
Kristin:
Quickly, to the basement! [laughs]
Jenny:
Oh, to the basement! Willow has to take off
for a day or two. Nothing you
need to worry about, Buffy, I just have to go…see about a girl. In Los Angeles.
Kristin:
She just has to go—she has to go see Fred’s
bells, you know? She’s gotta
go see some bells that Fred has.
Jenny:
Yeah. Yeah.
Kristin:
She does say—Willow does say, “Maybe I’ll
even bring back some good
news.”
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
Can’t wait to find out if she brings back—
Jenny:
What kind of good news she might come back
with.
Kristin:
[laughing] Some good news.
Jenny:
[makes chainsaw sound] Okay, I was a little—
Kristin:
[simultaneously] [laughs] That was such a
ladylike chainsaw effect, for
you. [laughs]
Jenny:
Yeah, it’s for Willow.
Kristin:
[laughing] Yeah.
Jenny:
So, I got a little ahead of myself a few minutes
ago. This is where Buffy’s
like, “I’m unchaining Spike.” And Giles is like, “Think about what you’re doing,” and
Buffy’s like, “I have.” And she’s, like, not interested in what he has to say and Buffy
and Spike exit. And Robin’s like, “Hey, Giles. Uh…you know, I bet the First is
[singsong] just, like, waiting for exactly the right moment to use Spike’s trigger. It
doesn’t sound very safe. Oh, by the way, I was raised by Bernard Crowley. Your
colleague!” [normal] And Giles is like, “Oh, you’re…Nikki Wood’s son and Spike
killed your mother.” He does some very fast math.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
And Robin’s like, “Yes.” And I really like Robin’s “yes’s” in this section.
They’re sort of, like, breathy and wounded, but also, like, really holding it together.
There’s, like, a lot—
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
In these little monosyllabic responses.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
And Giles is like, “So you’re telling me this
has nothing to do with personal
vengeance?” And Robin’s like, “No, I’m not telling you that, but do you care?”
Kristin:
Yeah. “He’s an instrument of evil.”
Jenny:
Yep, yep. This is something that needs to be
done for the greater good.
Kristin:
We already played the Patriarchy jingle but
I have an “ugh, men” in this
section. Because when Robin—when Wood is like, “She will never, never see it
coming.” Like, never see Spike—like, the First using Spike in the war against them.
And saying, like, “I’m talking about what needs to be done for the greater good,
Giles. And you know I’m right.” It’s like, this whole thing is just very…A.) it’s fucked
up that Giles is gonna basically use Wood as the tool to doing the thing that Giles
wants to have done. Not even caring—
Jenny:
Mmhmm.
Kristin:
I mean, like, just being like, “Yeah, I guess
you’re right, it doesn’t matter if
it’s vengeance.” Doesn’t it, though? Remember when Giles cared about shit? Like,
remember when he actually was invested in, like, doing things in a way that was,
like, sound? ‘Cause I have a vague memory of that.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
And B.) the “ugh, men” of it all is just,
like…why are we down here having
this conversation, as though your Slayer isn’t upstairs? And that, like, Buffy’s been
making some fucked up choices herself, but that doesn’t mean that these two
dudes downstairs should lie to her. Like, literally lie to her to undercut a decision
that she has made. That is not the way you do these things. Not, not, not, nope,
nuh-uh, mm-mm. [laughs]
Jenny:
Yeah. What you said.
Kristin:
Yeah. So Giles is like, “What exactly do
you propose?” And Robin is like,
“Just keep Buffy away for a few hours.” Fuck all of this, on every level.
Jenny:
Mmhmm. Mmhmm. So what brilliant scheme does
Giles come up with for
distraction? Ah, yes, training in the cemetery! Now?
Kristin:
[laughs] The fact that Buffy even agrees
to this is wild. [laughs]
Jenny:
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Buffy’s like, “Why
are we having a little training
session right now? And also, why did we leave Spike with Robin?” Err…[laughs]
Kristin:
Yeah. I guess the idea that the girls were
uncomfortable—like, I could
almost buy that, like, she let that happen. But this whole thing—
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
Is just a little wiggly. Little wiggly, guys.
Here’s Giles, telling Buffy she has
to look at the big picture. “If you’re gonna be a general, you have to make difficult
decisions.” And Buffy’s—
Jenny:
Oh, I thought if you were gonna be, like, a
leader of any kind, you had to
wait until your Slayer was emotionally, like, vulnerable and compromised, and then
you should just move to a different country across an ocean. I thought that was,
like, real leadership.
Kristin:
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, I mean, we should take
some—yep. Take a memo
from ol’ Giles.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
Really just—this has to be one of his worst
episodes since abandoning
Buffy. [laughs] This is rough. I mean, ‘cause it’s what he’s doing again. It’s just
like…remember Helpless? And remember, like, the arc that we saw in Giles’
character, inside of that one episode?
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
To cast that to the side, this late in the
game, it just—it’s just upsetting.
It’s upsetting that Robin is implicated in this. It’s upset—it’s just—this
whole—mm-mm. My next note is “crosses akimbo.” I don’t even know if I used
akimbo right, but it’s what came to me when we went into Robin’s sanctuary.
[laughs]
Jenny:
Oh, um, did you mean “agogo?”
Kristin:
[laughs] Maybe. What does “akimbo” mean?
Jenny:
Uh. [pause] I’m picturing diagonality. “With
hands on the hips and elbows
turned outward. [Kristin laughs] “Flung out wildly or haphazardly.”
Kristin:
Okay. Well, the crosses are flung out wildly
and haphazardly, but—
Jenny:
Don’t worry, Kristin and I took a moment to
[Kristin laughs] do that with
our arms. Both of us, on Zoom. [both laugh] So we fully understand the concept
now, we have grasped it.
Kristin:
We understand. It’s been a little lesson.
A little interior—inside-the-pod
little lesson for Jenny and I.
Jenny:
Yep. Yep.
Kristin:
But I do—actually, I do prefer “crosses agogo”
so we’ll go with that one.
[Jenny laughs] Crosses agogo in Robin’s garage or whatever. He’s just got one
thousand crosses and one iMac, that’s what’s inside of this…[laughs]
Jenny:
Oh, man. I can’t believe it’s, like, this kind
of iMac, you know what I mean?
What a treat. [both laugh]
Kristin:
The mouse—the little round mouse with the
clear clicky—
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
He’s also got iTunes 1.0 [Kristin laughs] loaded
up and open. Ready to go.
[gasps] That reminds me. Kristin, I recently obtained a new laptop, as you know,
and I just realized that those fuckers U2 got me again!
Kristin:
No!
Jenny:
Their stupid album is back in my iTunes library!
Kristin:
Are you fucking kidding me?! They
s t i l l
are doing that shit?
Jenny:
Yeah. Can you believe it?
Kristin:
[exhales] That’s why I don’t like U2.
Jenny:
Yeah. [laughs]
Kristin:
I literally do not like U2 solely for the
reason that they crammed their
music in my ears when I didn’t ask for it.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
I never gave consent and I feel upset—
Jenny:
Mmhmm. Yeah.
Kristin:
And I will never forgive U2 for that. I cannot
believe that shit’s still going
on. Holy fuck. Okay.
Jenny:
Before we talk about crosses akimbo-agogo—
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
I just wanna note a couple things from the
previous scene’s conversation—
Kristin:
Sure.
Jenny:
Between Giles and Buffy. He says, “If you’re
gonna be a general, you’re
gonna need to make difficult decisions regardless of cost.” And she says, [scoffs]
“Look at the way I’ve treated my friends. [Kristin laughs] And my family. And
Andrew, who defies categorization.” [both laugh] And this is funny, but it’s also
interesting to think about Buffy being, like, really in tune with how she has—the
way she has been lately.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
And that it’s intentional, that it’s a choice.
Because I feel like we’ve kinda
been watching this season sometimes feeling like, eugh. [laughs]
Kristin:
Right, right.
Jenny:
She is, like—she’s, uh, not in touch with herself or whatever. But she really
is and she’s being strategic about—
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
The way that she’s talking to people. Which—interesting
way to think about
it and just wanna hold onto that awareness as we move forward.
Kristin:
Yeah. I thought a lot about what we’ve seen
Buffy do, also in context of
how Giles is coming down on her right now, as well. Like, I stick to what I said in
previous episodes. Like, I’m not going to give Buffy room to behave the way that
she has behaved. And in the past, I have, sometimes, because of the pressure of,
like, whatever. But I do think that it’s just really important to remember that not
only is she feeling the weight of the world, but like, we are led to believe by this
episode that Giles is telling her that she has to do really fucked up shit to her family
and friends in order to win this war.
Jenny:
Mmhmm.
Kristin:
Which is really—not necessarily always been
his way.
Jenny:
Okay, so. Back in the garage, with the crosses
and the vintage Mac, two
good things happen. Robin takes a shirt off. Big positive.
Kristin:
What does Spike think is happening? Does
he think
t h e y ’ r e
gonna do a
little smooch? Why is he—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] [laughs] Yeah, why is he just,
like, chilling? Like, he’s
strapping, like, these—what do you call these? Punch enhancers?
Kristin:
Studded—[both laugh]
Jenny:
Kind of, like, arm—like, arm armor—? Forearm
armor? Slash—
Kristin:
But, like, sexy forearm armor. [laughs]
Jenny:
Yeah. It’s very hot. This is very hot. [both
laugh]
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
And then he tells Spike he’s been looking for
him for a long time. And then
they have an exchange that I really like, which is Robin says, “Ever since you killed
my mother—” and Spike—I feel like you can see Spike process—like, holding many
things at once—
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
In his mind as he chooses to say, “I killed
a lot of people’s mothers,” which
is—it’s like, true. It’s like, a little bit of a deflection.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
He’s like—it’s kind of like he’s making light
of it, but not—like, it’s like—it
straddles a line in a way that a lot of the dialogue that’s coming definitely does not.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
But I really like this moment here where we’re
suspended between, you
know, the front of the episode—
Kristin:
Mmm.
Jenny:
And all of their, you know, existence together
without Spike knowing what’s
up. And then we’re about to make a hard pivot into a different place. And I
really—it feels like we are—they’re, like, motionless together for a moment. They’re
frozen in this sort of, like, moment of, like, oh shit. Something’s about to happen.
[laughs] You know?
Kristin:
Yeah. Yeah. That’s really cool and also,
what it brought up for me is that in
this moment, I picked up some stuff. But when you just described it that way, I
realized that Spike is saying, “I killed a lot of people’s mothers,” casually. He’s
saying—
Jenny:
Oooh.
Kristin:
“What’s so special about your mother?” Uhh.
And he’s also saying, “I killed
my own fucking mother.” [laughs]
Jenny:
[exhales] Yeah, wow. Thanks for the full-body
chills, Kristin. [laughs]
Kristin:
Which—well, you—I didn’t even think about
it until you just said all the
things you said. Like, there really is a lot in that fucking line.
Jenny:
Yeah. [Kristin sighs] Yeah, and then Robin says, “You’d remember mine.
She was a Slayer.” And Spike’s like, okay, well, that is one of two.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
And just based on a few—I really don’t need
too many facts—
Kristin:
[simultaneously] [laughs] A little math.
Jenny:
Yeah, just simple math. [both laugh] And he
knows.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
And then, Robin tells Spike he doesn’t wanna
kill
S p i k e
, he wants to kill the
monster who took his mother away from him. And then he opens iTunes 1.0.
[Kristin laughs loudly] And smashes that play button and it’s all like, [singing]
“Early one morning, just as the sun was shining.” And Spike’s like, rahhh! And it’s
fucking on.
Kristin:
The most vicious and violent weapon anyone
could ever use to defeat the
person who killed their mother.
Jenny:
Yeah, yeah.
Kristin:
Smashing that iMac mouse. [laughs]
Jenny:
Uh-huh. Then we get this sort of, like, extended—you
know—Pratt house
flashback, intercut with Robin beating Spike up, who doesn’t appear to be fighting
back?
Kristin:
Spike.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
Yeah, I agree. Spike really does not fight
at all, in the whole—even later,
when we flip and Spike has the upper hand. Which, [laughs] by the way, I’m sorry.
There’s no way that Spike would not have had the upper hand the whole time. I
find that really—when, like, Robin is, like, holding Spike’s face up to the crucifixes
or the crosses or whatever. I’m like…I understand that, like, emotions were high.
But if we are to believe everything we’ve been told, Spike is one of the best
warriors on the face of planet Earth.
Jenny:
Well—
Kristin:
[simultaneously] And Wood does not have superhuman
strength of any
kind.
Jenny:
I think what’s going on here—I think there’s
a couple things going on. Or,
like, one of—one or more things is happening, in my viewing. We’re seeing the rest
of this flashback now.
Kristin:
Oh, Spike is also seeing—?
Jenny:
[simultaneously] So it’s like, is Spike kind
of, like—
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Yeah.
Jenny:
Elsewhere, mentally?
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
Is Spike having a soul and, like, understanding
what is happening right now
and, like, who Robin is and, like, why Robin is doing this to him—
Kristin:
Right.
Jenny:
And is he sort of, like, oh fuck, you’re right,
dude. You know what I mean?
Kristin:
Right. Right.
Jenny:
Regard—you know, putting aside what he says
later—
Kristin:
Right.
Jenny:
Is he—
Kristin:
Fuck.
Jenny:
In a state of shock. Like—or is he just, like,
fully engaged in his head with
this flashback as we see, oh god, terrible news, Kristin. Anne is a vampire. She’s
tuberculosis-free, she’s looking quite healthy. William is so stoked and he’s like,
“Wow! Amazing! I’m so happy! What would like—what is the—whatever you would
like, let’s make sure that happens for you now.” And she’s like, “Well, my number
one fave thing would be to get the fuck away from you. [both laugh] Stat.” And she
does the worst thing she could do to him, maybe, until some other stuff she does
right after, which is [laughs] to quote his own poetry back to him, viciously.
Kristin:
Oh my god.
Jenny:
Mockingly.
Kristin:
Says “twaddle.” The word “twaddle” is used.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Twaddle. Yep, yep.
Kristin:
Listen. Can I pause? I know you’re on a roll
right now and I don’t wanna
take you off your course, but I just—
Jenny:
Oh, no.
Kristin:
I just realized something and it felt like
a big revelation for me. And then I
also kept thinking about it and then got even more confused. So I just wanna bring
it all to the table, for help.
Jenny:
Okay.
Kristin:
Because the first thing that I realized was
oh, remember how we were
having that conversation at the top of our pod episode, where we were like, did he
know that he killed his mom? Or did he not? Like, when he first remembered the
song was attached to his mom, did he know it all then or was it being revealed to
him over time? What I realized is that Spike has never had a soul and had this
memory. That’s the answer. It’s somewhere in between the two. It’s like, he knew,
as a vampire, that he had sired his mom and killed his mom. But he has never
relived this experience with a soul, and even when he was doing it—this is where I
got confused more—[Jenny laughs] even when this was happening, he didn’t have a
soul. Right?
Jenny:
Yeah. Yeah.
Kristin:
But maybe, like, he had just lost his soul,
so he had a little bit of
himself—little bit of, like—the soul stuff—the soul math is imprecise. But…but I do
like this idea that he is experiencing this for the first time, truly, as a person—as a
vampire with a soul.
Jenny:
Well. He also—no, now I’m thinking, Kristin—and
this might—quick sidebar.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
Because later, he says that it’s been weighing
on him for some time. But I
feel like what has been weighing on him is, like, the shitty stuff that his mom said
to him. And not that he actually killed his mother. [laughs]
Kristin:
Right, right. Right.
Jenny:
Right? I don’t know.
Kristin:
Right! Yeah, complicated shit. Anyway, sorry.
I just, like—I was practicing,
like, the biggest act of patience that I was capable of by, like, not saying that while
you were talking—
Jenny:
Yeah, wow, and you made it, like 50% through
my paragraph.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] I made it, like, halfway.
[laughs]
Jenny:
That’s huge for you. [both laugh]
Kristin:
I’m also growing, okay?
Jenny:
Oh my god! [laughing] She’s like—she says something—
Kristin:
Oof. This is awful.
Jenny:
“Ever since the day you first slithered from
me like a parasite. If I’d known
what this would be like, I would have dashed your brains out.” [laughs]
Kristin:
Like, this is
f u c k e d
.
Jenny:
“I prayed that you would get a girlfriend,
but who could hold a candle to
your housebound mum, a captive audience for your witless
p r a t t
le?”
Kristin:
Oohh.
Jenny:
P r a t t
-le!
Kristin:
I see. Yeah, this is fucking awful. This
is fucking awful. And this is—like I’ve
kind of said it a few times without saying it directly. But like, this show’s mythology,
this show’s lore, has always told us that when you are a vampire, you still have the
core of yourself. We’ve seen Vampire Willow being kinda gay. We’ve seen, like,
fucking Angel and Angelus and, like, how that’s connected to the Liam of it all.
Drusilla, clear example of how who she was before she was sired manifested in her
vampire form. So I’m gonna imagine that fucking everyone in the writers’ room
fucking knew that this is the mythology. How are you gonna give us this much of a
shift without us believing that the real truth of fucking William’s trauma and Spike’s
trauma is that his mom was a fucking monster?! I’m like, this is the only thing that
you could come out of this believing. Like, I don’t know how you could do any other
math here. This is not that, like, she became a vampire and suddenly was a
different person. This is that his fucked up relationship to his fucking mother was
because his mom was really fucked up. [laughs] He grew up with this mom that
had, like, a lot of really fucked up feelings and whatever. And like, I just—that’s how
I—that’s the only way I can interpret this.
Jenny:
Yeah, I don’t—I don’t know. I mean, we’re definitely
not supposed to feel
that way—like—
Kristin:
You’re not.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] That’s not what we’re supposed
to get from this episode.
Kristin:
I know.
Jenny:
But it does fly in the face of all the vampire
lore, personality-wise, that
we’ve—
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
Gotten from this show up to this point.
Kristin:
I know. And I know—sorry, I should have made
that clear. Like, I know
that that is not what they were writing—that this is not what you’re supposed to
take. You’re supposed to take that William’s mom always loved him and becoming a
vampire made her a monster. And it really was fucked up and then he had to kill his
own mom. But I just…Kristin Russo’s canon is that William’s mom was not well, like,
from when he was super little. And that that really fucked up his
relationship—fucked him up and fucked up their relationship big time.
Jenny:
Mmm.
Kristin:
And that, like, all of that manifested in
the siring. And—like, that just feels
much more real to me than, like, this wild idea that suddenly, she’s just this, like,
monster person. We’ve never seen that before. So I’m sorry. I don’t mean to take
us off of, like, the script of it all. But I just—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] No, no, no. There’s a lot
to—this episode is, like,
very…dense. [laughs]
Kristin:
Yeah. And like, honestly, this…we have other
scenes to, like, go through or
what have you. But I think there is—so I mentioned at the top of the episode that
Alba and our amazing listener, Charlie Peppers, had a conversation and that we
were gonna pull a little bit of it in. And I think this actually might be a really great
place to pull it in. Because you know, in a macro way, what we’re digging into is
how much we’re given with Spike and Spike’s mom, and how much the writers want
us to empathize, sympathize, side with Spike.
Jenny:
Mmhmm.
Kristin:
Right? Which is, like, fucked up and confusing
for a million reasons. But a
huge reason that it’s fucked up is that we have this, like, Black character finally
given some space in the show. And then in this one episode, despite the fact that
his mother was killed by this vampire, is still painted as the character that we
shouldn 't
empathize—that Buffy literally, in the end—and
we will talk about it more
when we get there—literally is like, “Sorry, bud. Sorry.” So let’s just hear a little—a
little clip from their chat, and then we’ll come back into the timeline.
[CHIME]
Alba:
Hi, Charlie.
Charlie:
Hi, Alba.
Alba:
I am so happy to have you on as a screenwriter,
community organizer,
wonderful overall person to talk about this episode, Lies My Parents Told Me.
Something that bothers me about Wood’s writing, particularly, is that the writers
left him as this four-year-old child, who is avenging his mother. They’re not writing
him as this, like, 35-year-old educated, intelligent man, who is trying to fight evil.
You know what I mean? And what he understands evil is to be Spike. I feel like he
wasn’t given the same nuance that Spike is given as he’s processing it. Like, Wood
in the episode gets doubly rejected, right? Kind of like how Spike does in Fool for
Love, where we see Wood kind of get rejected or, like, feel rejected by his mother in
the first scene, with Nikki saying, like, “You know, the mission is what matters. Like,
this is important, I have to go fight Spike.” And then Buffy at the end, saying, “The
mission is what matters.”
Charlie:
Right.
Alba:
And Wood doesn’t get to heal that mother wound.
Charlie:
Two things can be true at the same time.
Wood, yes, he grew up. He was
raised by a Watcher. But I think that he also put Buffy on the same pedestal that he
put his mom. And once he saw Spike threatening the closeness that they had,
something in him got a little unhinged. So from a writing standpoint, I could see
where the writers were going with that. But at the same time, as a Black man, one
of very, very few in the Buffyverse, they skipped over just the discernment he could
have had about it, the hard conversations he could have had about it. You know,
like, I think maybe him going to somebody else along with Giles, and kinda getting
what the group felt about it—
Alba:
Mmm.
Charlie:
The fact that he went to a white man to kinda
figure out how to get this
other guy out of the picture. Wood definitely understands proximity to whiteness in
the—[inaudible]
Alba:
Mmhmm.
Charlie:
So he capitalized on that. Wood deserved
catharsis, and when the
show—the show really dropped the ball when Buffy looked at Wood and said, “Oh, I
get it, but if you try that again, I’ll let him kill you.” That could have been such a
beautiful moment of connection, where she just sat with him and just said, “I get it.
Also, tell me about your mom.” But I think the show didn’t know what to do with
Wood’s mother wound and with his issues, because again, the show doesn’t know
how to handle blackness.
Alba:
Yeah.
Charlie:
So I think that it’s on either end of the
spectrum.
Alba:
Yeah.
Charlie:
You either have people who are super obedient,
like Kendra, who get killed
for being super obedient. Or you have people like Mr. Trick, who’s in it for himself
and then is punished for being in it for himself. You know? So I think—
Alba:
Right.
Charlie:
With Black characters in Buffy, we never
get to see them develop humility
or discernment or to see them arc in a way. Once they’re—once they’ve served their
purpose for Buffy or any of the other characters, it’s kinda like, oh. Done, now
you’re over there. Which, again, feeds into the alienation of being one of few people
who are a person of color in Sunnydale.
Alba:
Yeah, totally, totally. I think it would have
been really powerful if Robin was
able to have the same kind of process that Spike had, while he’s getting beat up.
Like, imagine if Robin was, like, also beating him up, having like, flashes. You
know? And then, like, coming to this resolution and then them making amends.
Like, imagine if they made amends.
Charlie:
Right! It would have been so lovely if Buffy
comes to pull them apart, but
they’re just talking or maybe having a beer. [laughs] And Robin’s like, yeah.
Alba:
Ugh, that would have been so cool. And then
for the rest of the series, they
could be friends, you know? Like, or could be allies.
Charlie:
Building that solidarity would have been
a really great note to end the
episode on. But again, we gotta make the Black dude not know how to control his
emotions and just very volatile when it concerns his trigger.
Alba:
Yeah. Definitely.
[CHIME]
Kristin:
Thank you, Alba. Thank you, Charlie.
Jenny:
Yeah! Thanks, guys.
Kristin:
Yeah, and there’ll be a link in the show
notes to hear a bit more of that
conversation, if you wanna hear more than the segment that we popped in there
and, of course, information—you will always know how to find Alba. But [Jenny
laughs] we’ll put some information on where to find Charlie as well. And thank you
for having that—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Yeah, Alba’s in that semicircular
window over the main
entrance of the high school, right? Usually?
Kristin:
[laughing] Yeah. She’s just on a constant
loop, reenacting—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Just waiting.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Angelus and Jenny Calendar,
yeah. Okay, so back into
this fight that is back and forth between the flashback of this horrific fucking
exchange between William and his mom, and then to the fight between Wood and
Spike. This is the scene where Anne says to William, “You actually will always be
who you always have been, which is a limp, sentimental fool.” So A.) fool is used.
Fool for Love is the title of the episode where we, like, start really kind of getting
some idea about Spike before he was sired.
Jenny:
Mm, mmhmm.
Kristin:
Limp is literally the word that Nikki used
at the top. And this is, like, this
big braid of, like, Spike’s feelings about women are really fucked up and
complicated. [both laugh] Cool!
Jenny:
Meanwhile, back in the garage. Robin is getting
into it.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
Things are intensifying. There’s some yelling.
I was just thinking—you
know, I was saying, like, oh, it’s odd because it feels like in this pairing, Spike is
generally the—the one that’s shown to be way more emotional than Robin. But
there’s also—as somebody who—personally, I love to hold onto things. And—
Kristin:
Mmm.
Jenny:
Not say them or deal with them until they have
reached a point of critical
mass.
Kristin:
Mmmm.
Jenny:
And I can certainly relate to—well, you know
what a cool guy I am. Being a
cool guy [both laugh] for an extended period of time and then, uhh, reaching a sort
of point where I can no longer hold on—
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
To the thing and it’s just like—[makes explosion
sound]
Kristin:
Yeah. Yeah.
Jenny:
So I mean, obviously, Robin has been—you know—forced to hold the reality
of his mother’s murder for, you know, decades at this point.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
So I think we can all—[laughs]
Kristin:
Yeah, this—I—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Sympathize with where he’s
at.
Kristin:
I agree, I agree. I think that this piece
is—I think this piece is done really
well and also performed really well. Like—
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
His delivery of “Is this what it felt like
when you beat the life out of her,
toyed with her, when you snapped her neck?” is some really stunning acting that is
happening.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
And I agree with you. I think this does make
sense. Robin’s whole, like,
loss of groundedness and reality is hard. But this moment—he has imagined this
fucking moment, like you said, for decades. And it’s happening right now. That’s
really overwhelming. And I really like this moment that they give to Wood.
Jenny:
Yeah. Okay, then over in the cemetery. What
am I supposed to think about
this? Giles and Buffy are talking and Giles is like, “Oh, like, faced with the same
choice now between, you know, sacrificing Dawn to save the world or not, you’d let
Dawn die to save the world, wouldn’t you?” And Buffy’s like, “Yeah.” I don’t believe
that!
Kristin:
Me either.
Jenny:
I don’t believe enough has changed for us to,
like, buy this. It just doesn’t
feel true. She is being more strategic. She is, like, working hard to put up emotional
boundaries. But she has not been fully successful. Look at her relationship with
Spike and how she is handling—
Kristin:
Exactly.
Jenny:
This—within the space of this very episode, how she’s handling Spike. Like,
she would never. She would never sacrifice Dawn. She would—her mantra, to the
end, would be, “We will find another way.”
Kristin:
Right. I agree. And I think, like—I mean,
you know, part of what we’re
doing is giving a lot of room to Buffy. And I think that you could probably fall on
either side of this line, of like, do we give this room to Buffy? Do we not? Do we
give this room to the writers, do we not? I don’t know. But I would say that one
interpretation of this could be that sometimes, when you don’t know how to do a
thing, you just follow a script. And like, part of me thinks, like, maybe she’s just
following a script. Like, she knows that what she’s being asked to do is be someone
who—and that’s what’s fucked up, too. Like, why is she being asked to be the kind
of leader that would, like, kill her sister if it meant, like, the greater good? ‘Cause
she’s not historically been asked to do something like that by—at least by her, like,
friends and family. But if she is being asked, if she is being told this is a war bigger
than any war. This is unlike anything you’ve ever known and you have to act
differently, you have to actually do these things this way and only this way,
otherwise you’ll lose. Like, maybe there’s a space where she is saying, “yes, I
would,” because she wants to believe that she can do the things that she’s being
told she has to do. But in actuality, I just think it’s kinda poor writing and…and not
in, like, a line-to-line way, but just like in a story way. I just don’t think that this is
where our characters would have gone. I don’t think they would have actually gone
this way. And—
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
That’s a bummer.
Jenny:
Then we go back to Robin’s and he’s saying
to Spike, “You never cared
about anyone but yourself. You’re all about the hunt.” And this makes me feel like
we’re supposed to be thinking about Nikki here. Like, this feels like he is kind of
having—
Kristin:
Right. He’s, like, projecting or whatever.
Jenny:
Yeah, yeah. There’s some, like, conflation
here.
Kristin:
Mmhmm. Conflation is a better word.
Jenny:
It does feel like his…maybe regrets and anxieties
about, like, feeling second
fiddle when he was a kid—
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
To his mom’s job—
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
Is coming out here.
Kristin:
Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I mean. Man. Stuff like
this—I think I’ve said this
before, but it’s like, when an episode of television or when a TV show is just like,
bad, then I’m like, well, that was not good. But like, when we have so
much—there’s so much there and there’s so much richness and there’s so many
ways that it could have gone so powerfully well, and it doesn’t. It’s so disappointing
to me and that’s, like, how I feel with all of this. Because, like, that is rich. This is
rich. It’s so—there’s so much there. They have done so much groundwork to give us
such a good fucking story, and I just feel like they shit the bed. Anyway.
Jenny:
Yeah, it doesn’t feel, like, as satisfying
as it really could have.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] As it could have. As it
could have. And I mean, I love the
jacket. The jacket does a great job throughout the episode. Spike’s making a
comment on the jacket, you know, that he takes the jacket when he kills Nikki.
Robin takes the jacket back right now. And by the end of the episode, Spike has the
fucking jacket back on. The jacket does the job that the whole episode should be
doing. [laughs]
Jenny:
Right. [both laugh] Right.
Kristin:
And I guess we still—we still have a little
bit more of the—I don’t want
anymore of this flashback with Anne and with William.
Jenny:
[disgusted] No!
Kristin:
But this is fucking disgusting and awful.
She is saying a lot of things about
what she imagines her son wanted from her. It’s all very incest, incest, incest.
Jenny:
[disgusted] Eeeee!
Kristin:
William is horrified and is like, “I loved
you but not like this.” Like, he
is—this is fucking trauma.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
And she is like, “This is what you always
wanted. There, there, precious, it
will only hurt for a moment.” And Spike just says, “I’m sorry.” And before we
culminate the scene in the flashback, we see Robin saying, “What?” and Spike
saying, “I’m sorry.” We go back to the flashback and we see William kill Anne. The
vampire. [laughs] The vampire Anne.
Jenny:
The Anne-pire, if you will. [both laugh] Ugh,
god. And then—oh no. Okay,
so that is rough. Then back at Robin’s, there’s some really, really rough business
that we have to wade through, where—you know—Spike is, like, in his head but
he’s saying “I’m sorry” out loud. And Robin says, like, “Oh, an apology? Fuh. What
good is an apology?” And Spike’s like, “I wasn’t talking to you.” And then
Spike—real Spike—is back, present, and fighting back.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
And he says, “I don’t give a piss about your
mom. She was a Slayer, I was
a vampire.” Now this is a thing that is true.
Kristin:
[laughs] Yeah.
Jenny:
But does not need—just because something is
true doesn’t mean that you
need to or should say it.
Kristin:
Yeah. “She knew what she was signing up for”
is a real choice of line, as
well. Can you show me the Slayer signup sheet?
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Yeah. Oh yeah, ‘cause as we
know, all Slayers sign up for
their duty. [both laugh] It’s—yeah. This is, like, very weird—this, like, turning
Robin’s loss into this, like, weird thing where, like, Spike is telling Robin that he is
misplacing his anger—like, misdirecting his anger at Spike when really he should be
directing his anger as his mother for putting her job ahead of him, as her son.
Kristin:
Yeah, because the truth is, like, Robin should
be putting his anger on the
person that—the vampire that Spike was.
Jenny:
Yes.
Kristin:
Like, that’s a valid place for anger. And
I think that in a healthy and
restorative space, a conversation could be had where Robin could feel anger
towards Spike before Spike had a soul, and all of the fucking hurt and harm that
Spike caused. And Spike could have room for the fact that those were bad things
that he did and that anger is worthy and is meant there, not at fucking Nikki. Like,
that’s the beautiful place that this episode could go. And instead, it’s just—let’s just
blame Nikki? Get the fuck out of here. Get the—get the fuck—I’m so mad. I know
I’m not saying anything, like, genius. It’s just—I’m so fucking mad about it.
Jenny:
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Then…[laughs] then. Robin’s
like, “You took her away.
She was all I had. She was my world.” And Spike says, “And you weren’t hers.
Doesn’t that piss you off?” Feels like there’s a lot of Buffy crosstalk [laughs] going
on here.
Kristin:
Yep. Yep.
Jenny:
Now who’s projecting, Hector Projector?
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Now who’s projecting? Exactly.
This whole—the name of
this scene is actually Hector Projector, so.
Jenny:
Yeah, yeah. And Spike goes on to say, “No matter
how many people Slayers
have around them, they fight alone. The rest of us be damned. Your mother was
the same.” And Robin says, “She loved me,” and Spike says, “But not enough to
quit, though, was it?” This…doesn’t hold water. [laughs]
Kristin:
No.
Jenny:
For me. Like—
Kristin:
No, I don’t think it should hold water for
anybody, any of you. If you’re
listening to this, please do not allow this to hold water for you.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
‘Cause this is a bunch of bull. [laughs]
Jenny:
Yeah. You know who can’t understand being a
Slayer? Spike or Robin. [both
laugh] A thought, by Jenny Owen Youngs. [both laugh]
Kristin:
I think—honestly, I think Robin—I think if
Robin had been given the time
that Spike has been given, Robin would actually get there. Spike should fucking
understand a little bit more at this point. I really do—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Right, right. Spike should
have gotten there by now.
Kristin:
Yeah. I think Spike has had plenty of time—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Well, he’s only had a soul
for, like, five minutes.
Kristin:
Fine. Fine. So, Spike tells Wood how he sired
his own mom, she said some
nasty things, but “you helped me figure out that I had a mother that loved me
back.” This is—I don’t have to talk about it ‘cause I’ve already talked about it for—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] “Unlike you.” What?!
Kristin:
Thank you. “I was her world.” Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Mmm. Fucked up. [Jenny
sighs] I just don’t like—and this is really where it just comes back to the writers.
Because the writers have had—and I think we heard Charlie give voice to this in
that little clip—like, had no idea how to write the trauma that Wood had
experienced, and so therefore just kinda didn’t.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
And the lack of that in this story, both
in the story as we’re shown it and
also, in Spike’s awareness—’cause that is also written—is so glaring. Because Nikki
clearly loved her fucking son. Desperately, deeply. Was trying to literally, actually
save the fucking world while raising her small child, with no support past her
Watcher—
Jenny:
Mmhmm.
Kristin:
Who was doing the job of both Watcher and
caretaker for both of them,
and literally had no support either. Like, it doesn’t seem like anyone in that fucking
entire triad had support.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
Because you wanna—if we didn’t know what
we knew about Nikki’s
Watcher, then I would probably just throw him into the old white man bin. But
knowing that he raised Robin, probably without support, makes me feel like he also
parted ways with the Council. And you know, probably did some of the stuff that,
like, Giles did with Buffy, in terms of supporting her outside of those structures. But
just the idea—just the, like, fucking gall and racism that it takes to, like, write
Nikki’s story the way that Nikki’s story is written, to write Robin’s response to the
reality the way that it’s written, to write Spike interacting with this and then we’re
about to get to Buffy. It’s just—it’s just not good.
[WHITE SUPREMACY jingle plays]
You know what that sounds like to me? (What?)
White supremacy! (Oh no)
Woven in not too subtly (Ugh)
White supremacy! (Uh-uh)
Open your eyes and that's where you'll find it
Crush that (squash that)
White supremacy!
Kristin:
So one good thing is that the trigger is
deactivated, so that’s good.
Jenny:
Yay! [Kristin laughs] He is playing—smash that
play button and he’s like,
[sings tune of Early One Morning]. [Kristin laughs] And then he says, “Great, you
cured me, so now that you know I’m not under any influence, just wanted you to
know I’m doing this of my own volition. And now I’m gonna kill you!” Just like when
Angel did a little pillow smother, over on Angel. [both laugh] And Spike bends down
to take a chomp—
Kristin:
[simultaneously] It is. Yeah—
Jenny:
Cut to.
Kristin:
Commercial! [laughs]
Jenny:
Yeah. And then, back at the cemetery. Giles
is like, ohh, you know,
Angel—we love Angel, even though he occasionally does a little pillow-smother over
on Angel. He left town because he recognized that your relationship was bad for
you.
Kristin:
Right.
Jenny:
You know. And Giles is like, “What about what
Spike did in the past?” and
Buffy’s like, “He has a soul.” And then, it all crystalized in her eyes.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
And she’s like, oh my god, you’re stalling
me and keeping me away from
Spike! And she just kills the vampire that she’s been having, like, a very prolonged
and funny fight with—
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Richard? [laughs]
Jenny:
For the whole episode, basically. And runs out of the cemetery, to go to
Spike. And Giles, very unhelpfully, kind of loudly speaks after her, “It’s time to stop
playing the role of general and start being one! This is the way wars are won!” [high
pitched] Is it? Is it? [normal] Okay, but here’s the thing.
Kristin:
Okay.
Jenny:
There’s a deleted scene here, at the very end,
which I think would have
provided a smoother transition—
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
Where Giles divulges to Buffy that he made
a really hard decision when he
killed Ben—
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
Who technically is an innocent, but, you know,
Giles made the executive
decision—so that Buffy wouldn’t have to, by the way—
Kristin:
Right.
Jenny:
To kill him while he was weakened so that Glory
could never come back
through his body. Now, I have unearthed the script of this deleted scene, and
Kristin and I are going to perform a dramatic reading of it.
Kristin:
Oooh.
Jenny:
Right now! Okay, do you wanna be Giles or Buffy?
Kristin:
I think you get to choose, Jenny.
Jenny:
Okay.
Kristin:
You brought this to the table.
Jenny:
I’m gonna be…Giles.
Kristin:
‘Kay.
Jenny:
[sighs] So Giles says, “Yes. And the First
seems to be exploiting it to his
advantage.”
Kristin:
“Exactly. The First’s doing this. Spike’s
innocent.”
Jenny:
“So was Ben.”
Kristin:
“Buffy stops cold. The vamp launches at her
and she whip-stakes him to
dust.” “Ben?”
Jenny:
“He was a human being, after all, forced his
whole life to share his mortal
form with a demigod from a hell dimension.” Giles looks into the camera to deliver
this information to people who have never watched a season before Season 7.
[both laugh]
Kristin:
“Glory, I know. What does that have to do…?”
Jenny:
“Ben was oblivious to the atrocities Glory
committed, no more responsible
for her crimes than Spike is to his when triggered. Glory was invincible, impossible
to kill. Ben was not. So after you defeated her, after you left Ben lying there, alive,
I made a decision, one that you couldn’t.”
Kristin:
“Giles.”
Jenny:
“I put my hand over his mouth and as he struggled
weakly, I smothered
him. Because it had to be done. He was a liability.”
Kristin:
And then we get, “Oh god, you’ve been stalling
me, keeping me away.”
That’s how it was meant to go.
Jenny:
Yeah, and it packs more of a wallop and also
just, like, really helps the
believability—
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
Of that realization coalescing.
Kristin:
Yeah, I agree. I agree. And I’m so curious
as to why—’cause like, that
doesn’t seem like the place they would have cut if it was a time cut. Like, it feels
like they specifically cut it? But…I don’t understand why.
Jenny:
Yeah, weird. Well, maybe because they didn’t
want the father figure of the
show rehashing the very specific details of how he murdered a helpless civilian.
[laughs]
Kristin:
Yeah, well, but that’s the fucking reality!
Those are the lies my parents told
me, bitches.
Jenny:
Mmm!
Kristin:
So yeah, Buffy’s realized, she runs over
to Robin’s house. And…Spike, in
his coat again. Buffy sees Spike first, is like, “What happened?” And Spike opens
the door, ‘cause we have all been led to believe that Spike has killed Wood. Spike
opens the door and we see—I mean, Wood looks as bad as Buffy looked a few
episodes ago when she was all beat up from Turok-Han, you know, like, he’s like,
fucked up.
Jenny:
Yeah. It’s not good.
Kristin:
And—yeah. And Spike says, “I gave him a pass,
I let him live on account of
the fact that I killed his mother. He even so much as looks at me funny again, I’ll
kill him.” Guys, what story are we telling? And then to make it worse, we go inside.
And Buffy explains she also lost her mom. Not relatable content! Not relatable
content, Buffy! This is not just the dead moms club. This is fucking his mom was
murdered by Spike when he was a small child and he witnessed it.
Jenny:
Yeah. How do we get Spike and Robin into couples’
therapy?
Kristin:
Yeah!
Jenny:
By next episode.
Kristin:
Oh my god, and Riley as the therapist.
Jenny:
Yes!
Kristin:
[laughs] Ugh! “I understand what you tried
to do, but she’s dead.” He
says, “Because he murdered her.” And she is like, “I’m preparing to fight a war and
you’re looking for revenge against a man who doesn’t exist anymore.” And then
what does she say, Jenny? What does she say.
Jenny:
Oh, she says, “Spike is the strongest warrior
that we have and we’re gonna
need him if we wanna get out of this alive. If you try anything again, Spike will kill
you. And more importantly, I’ll let him. I have a mission to win this war, to save the
world. I don’t have time for vendettas. The mission is what matters.” This last line
really clanks for me.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
It just feels like, oh yeah, I remember that
from the beginning of the
episode, person who wrote the episode.
Kristin:
Right, exactly, exactly.
Jenny:
You know, it just feels like—it’s not a phrase
that’s been in this world before
this episode. So it doesn’t feel like a natural, satisfying, like, “boom” moment that it
maybe could have if it was set up differently or something.
Kristin:
Yeah, I agree.
Jenny:
Here’s the thing. [laughs] Is there a winner
in this episode?
Kristin:
A winner, like, in—what do you mean, a winner?
Like—
Jenny:
Just like—
Kristin:
Is there a character who got something good?
[both laugh] No.
Jenny:
Yeah, I just think everybody’s—
Kristin:
Willow. [laughs]
Jenny:
Really having a bad time—yeah, Willow got to
leave and that was good
[both laughing] and also got to meet Fred, which is good.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Yeah, Willow got to get
the fuck out of Sunnydale for a
minute.
Jenny:
It’s like, what Buffy is saying to Robin is
all practical. It’s just so…harsh?
And kind of, like, goes back to her “I’ve been developing my really intense and
harsh bedside manner—” [laughs]
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
“As the general of Sunnydale” kind of thing.
Like, yes, Spike is a powerful,
strong asset. And yes, they are going up against evil on a scale that they really
can’t conceive.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
You know? And yes, Robin is also a powerful
fighter and, like, yes, we want
everyone on the side of good—
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
Fighting this evil, regardless of interpersonal—you
can kill each other after
we save the world, boys. Don’t make me turn this apocalypse around. [Kristin
laughs] You know?
Kristin:
Uh-huh.
Jenny:
That being said, I feel like Robin is just,
like, robbed by everyone—[laughs]
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
Of—in this episode—of, like, the validity—
Kristin:
Yes.
Jenny:
Of losing his mom and Spike being responsible.
Kristin:
I agree. I agree.
Jenny:
And also, like, the—just the integrity of his
mother’s love. You know? Which
is—
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Yes! I fucking agree. That’s
why I’m so fucking mad.
Jenny:
Directly called into question by Spike, a guy
who fucking is basing it on his
experience with Buffy!
Kristin:
Right, right. Right. So, yeah—
Jenny:
Ugh.
Kristin:
Also, just to, like, go further with what
you’re saying, one of—I pulled in
one of the notes that Mack had written, which I feel goes right here. One of Mack’s
notes was, “This is a real ‘solidarity is for white women’ moment. Spike’s mom’s
cruelty is written off as, quote, ‘not really being her,’ while Nikki’s inadvertent
cruelty is served up as her own choice.”
Jenny:
Mmhmm.
Kristin:
“Additionally, Buffy not only lets Nikki’s
murder go, she makes it clear that
if her son doesn’t make nice with his mother’s murderer, she’ll let Spike kill him.”
And Mack’s last sentence of this: “Faith would never.” [both laugh] Yes. Yes!
Jenny:
Hmm, Faith. Yeah, if only Faith would come
to town and straighten all these
people out. [laughs]
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Yeah, we need—paging Faith
Lehane! God, fuck, man. So.
Anyway. I feel—I know we’ve already talked for so long, this is a long episode.
And—but I could be mad about this for, like, at least another five hours.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
Back at the Summers house, Buffy is smoothing
out a bandage on Dawn’s
head. And then Giles shows up in the hallway.
Jenny:
Oh, you…silly man. [laughs] Rolling in like,
“hey, I totally understand that
you’re mad at me.”
Kristin:
[simultaneously] You must be so—
Jenny:
And she’s like, bitch, he is alive! [Kristin
laughs] Spike is alive!
Kristin:
Giles, what the fuck? Honestly, imagine Spike
wasn’t alive and this is the
shit that Giles was saying to her in the hallway?
Jenny:
Oh my god. Oh my god!
Kristin:
What world are we living in, you guys? “Well,
that doesn’t change
anything,” Giles says. “What I told you is still true. You need to learn…”
Jenny:
And Buffy’s like, “I think you’ve taught me
everything I need to know” and
closes the door in his face! Right in his face. What do you think about that?
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Yep. She’s like, this is
the consequences of being one of
the parents who’s lied—in this—you know?
Jenny:
Yes.
Kristin:
This is the consequence you get. You know who the only fucking parent
who didn’t lie in this fucking set of parents is, is goddamn Nikki Wood! Nikki Wood
didn’t fucking lie! Nikki Wood did not tell any lies to Robin.
Jenny:
Yeah!
Kristin:
She did not tell him any lies! She does not
belong in this set of parents.
Giles fucking lied. Anne fucking lied.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
Nikki Wood? Fucking did not lie. Ooh!
Jenny:
Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin:
Anyway. Here we are, at the end of the episode.
And you know, we’ve just
been yelling so much that I forgot to even try to get sexy. But…it’s our job. It’s our
responsibility, goddamn it.
Jenny:
Yeah, and it’s one we take very seriously.
[SEXUAL TENSION AWARD jingle plays]
Sexual tension award!
Jenny:
Welcome back to yet another installment of
the Sexual Tension Awards. One
thing I learned from this episode is that some flashbacks are sexier than others.
And…[Kristin laughs] the positive pickings may be slim, but we’re going to milk
them for all they’re worth. Let’s give it up in slot number one for Drusilla, daffodils
and viscera. [laughs]
Kristin:
Hot, hot, hot!
Jenny:
A trio made in heaven.
Kristin:
Truly.
Jenny:
And then sent directly to hell. [both laugh]
Looking back and reminiscing,
I’m so nostalgic for a time before the second two-thirds of this episode occurred.
Back when I could enjoy a pairing like Giles and books in slot number two.
Kristin:
Very sexy. Always sexy.
Jenny:
Who could forget the raw magnetism between those two ships, passing
each other in the night? Xander and a set of chains firmly affixed to the wall of the
Summers basement, in slot number three.
Kristin:
Ugh, he loves chains. Alice In Chains? More
like Xander in chains. You
know what I mean?
Jenny:
Oh my god. And! Finally, [both laugh] in slot
number four—really, it’s all we
have. God bless them, they’re off of our screens but not out of our hearts. Willow
and Fred, together in Los Angeles!
Kristin:
[chanting] Give us Willow and Fred! Give
us Willow and Fred! By casting a
vote for Willow and Fred, you’re casting a vote for Buffering the Vampire Slayer and
Angel on Top, all at the same time. So.
Jenny:
And to love being real. [Kristin laughs] If
you want to cast your vote, you
can find this episode and every episode’s Sexual Tension Awards on our Twitter
feed, in poll format, where you can just click your little vote and make your voice
heard. That poll will be live one week from the publishing date of this episode, so go
forth!
Kristin:
Hell yeah.
[SEXUAL TENSION AWARD jingle plays]
Sexual tension award!
Jenny:
Well, this is a disturbing little piece of
television. [both laugh]
Kristin:
Yeah. We did it, we made it till the end,
so.
Jenny:
Thank god.
Kristin:
We can say, [sings] “It’s the end, it’s the
end of that episode.”
Jenny:
[singing along] “The end of the episode.” [Kristin
laughs] No big deal,
I…know that song.
Kristin:
Well, Jenny.
Jenny:
Yo.
Kristin:
Are you still Jenny Owen Youngs, or has that
changed?
Jenny:
Oh man, I’m so glad you asked. Yes, I am Jenny
Owen Youngs, and when
I’m not being disappointed by this episode of Buffy, I am usually writing and
recording music. Can you believe it? I put out an EP last month of a collection of
songs inspired by video games. It’s called It’s Dangerous to Go Alone. You can find
the EP on Bandcamp or your favorite digital music platform. You can give me a
shout on Twitter, @JennyOwenYoungs. And most other socials as well, including
now, oh god, Tiktok, oops, it’s happening. [takes deep breath] And you can join me
for livestreams on Twitch on a weekly basis.
Kristin:
Can’t believe you’re on Tiktok. I’m gonna
join Tiktok only to do that thing
that you can do on Tiktok where you use other people’s Tiktoks and then you put
yourself in the screen.
Jenny:
Yep.
Kristin:
So my Tiktok will just be me talking about
all of—
Jenny:
Reacting?
Kristin:
Your Tiktoks. [laughs]
Jenny:
I would love that. I would—[both laugh] I would
welcome that engagement,
yes, please. [both laughing] All engagement is good engagement on Tiktok, Kristin,
bring it on.
Kristin:
Write it down that Jenny said all engagement
is good engagement, today.
[Jenny laughs] And then check back in, in a few months.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Yeah, I will regret those
words, yes.
Kristin:
My name is Kristin Russo and you can learn
more about the work that I do
with LGBTQ+ communities on my website, kristinnoeline.com. That’s K-R-I-S-T-I-N
N-O-E-L-I-N-E. And you can use that spelling to also find me on Twitter and on
Instagram. I am not on Tiktok, and I—as much as it sounds fun to react to Jenny’s
Tiktoks, I probably will not do it for that purpose. [Jenny laughs] But I am on
Twitter and Instagram, so you can find me there. And what about us, as a
duo—unless we join forces on Tiktok, where else could they find us together, Jenny?
Jenny:
[laughs] Buffering the Vampire Slayer is on
Twitter, Facebook and
Instagram, @BufferingCast or drop us an email at
bufferingthevampireslayer@gmail.com.

[Jenny scoffs] [Kristin sings tune] Anyway. What else? Jenny? [both laugh]
