Buffering the Vampire Slayer
Episode 2.08: The Dark Age

Jenny: ​Hey, everybody! Before we get started today, we just wanted to
alert you to an upcoming streaming event.
Kristin: ​Yes, on Friday, March 10, the 20th anniversary of the airing of the
first episode of the first season of ​Buffy the Vampire Slayer ​on the WB, we,
Jenny Owen Youngs and myself, Kristin Russo, will be doing a live
Buffy-watch of Season 1, Episode 1, “Welcome to the Hellmouth.”
Jenny: ​Hooray!
Kristin: ​Yes, at 5 pm Pacific, 8 pm Eastern so that we’re lined up exactly the
moment that it happened. Who knows what will become of this?
Jenny: ​What spirits may be invoked.
Kristin: ​Right? Seriously. Very serious stuff. It’s totally free, it is on
Facebook. Our Facebook page is facebook.com/bufferingcast. All you need is
access to the episode. We will see you there. We will count down, we will all
press play together and you know, have a blast.
Jenny: ​It’s gonna be so fun.
Kristin:​ It’s gonna be the best.
Jenny: ​See you there.
[THEME SONG]
Jenny: ​Hello and welcome to Buffering the Vampire Slayer, a podcast where
we’re watching and discussing every episode of ​Buffy the Vampire Slayer​,
one by one. I am Jenny Owen Youngs.
Kristin: ​And I am Kristin Russo, and this week we’re talking about Season
2, Episode 8, “The Dark Age.” Stay tuned at the end of this podcast every


week for an original song, written by us, recapping the ​Buffy ​episode we are
discussing.
Jenny: ​“The Dark Age” was written by Dean Batali and Rob Des Hotel, or
possibly “Day” Hotel, and directed by Bruce Seth Green. It originally aired on
November 10, 1997. Do you think we’ll ever know how Rob’s name is
properly pronounced?
Kristin: ​I bet you there’s a way to find out. I think.
Jenny: ​Probably somebody listening knows.
Kristin: ​Yeah, I think there’s a way. So you let us know –
Jenny: ​Please.
Kristin: ​What are the two options? “Day” –?
Jenny:​ Rob “Dez” Hotel or Rob “Day” Hotel?
Kristin: ​I’m gonna go with “Day” Hotel. My money’s on “Day” Hotel. What
about you?
Jenny: ​I like “Dez”. Like, it’s short for Desi, which is short for something
even longer. Desmond! There we go.
Kristin: ​So your guess is Desmond Hotel, is the actual last name of this
person.
Jenny: ​Yes! And a place I’d like to live.
Kristin: ​This is the one where Giles’ past comes back to haunt him as a
demon he and Ethan Rayne summoned ​sexily ​in their wild youth, seeks
them out in Sunnydale.
Jenny: ​Wow.
Kristin: ​That’s the IMDB description, except for one – one word that I
added.


Jenny: ​I wonder which word you added!
Kristin: ​Yeah, it was just Sunnydale! It didn’t say Sunnydale.
Jenny: ​Ah hah!
Kristin: ​Yeah. So – yeah. No.
Jenny: ​Nice edit!
Kristin: ​I mean, I think we all know where the Sexual Tension Award is
going this week!
Jenny: ​[sings] Yes!
Kristin: ​Is it inappropriate to just jump right out of the gate with Sexual
Tension?
Jenny: ​Just start with STA? Let’s go for it. It’s obviously Ethan Rayne and
Giles.
Kristin: ​Oh my ​God​!
Jenny: ​Get a room to conduct your demonic possession rituals.
Kristin: ​You know, I thought that we were being like, a little silly the first
time? Like I didn’t, ‘cause I really did sense sexual tension, but I thought
like, we were laying it on a little thicker than it was actually there? I take it
all – I take all of those thoughts back.
Jenny: ​It’s there. It’s real.
Kristin: ​This is overt.
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​This is an overt – like, I’m not even kidding you, you’re looking at
me like I’m saying a funny joke.


Jenny: ​No, I’m not! I’m with you!
Kristin: ​Their character relationship is 100% at least that Ethan Rayne had
a huge crush on Giles when they were younger.
Jenny: ​I’m with you! I am 100% on board for the implications of some kind
of Giles-Ethan Rayne youthful entanglement.
Kristin: ​Right? Come on! Give us the goods!
Jenny: ​Bisexual Giles? Feeling it.
Kristin: ​Right? Come on! I don’t know, my whole – do you want to know the
story that I made up?
Jenny: ​Please.
Kristin: ​Is that, so, Giles and Ethan, super tight. Giles, straight. Ethan, bi,
gay, what have you. Attracted to, you know, maybe just a Giles... Giles...
sexual.
Jenny: ​Giles-sexual? Sure, sure.
Kristin: ​Yes, a Giles-sexual. But Ethan has a crush on Giles. They pass out
and possess themselves with this demon, ‘cause he does say “they
discovered –” What is this demon’s name?
Jenny: ​Eyghon, of course!
Kristin: ​Eyghon, of course. That they discovered him together. It sounded
to me like they discovered it, the two of them, before they brought it to the
group?
Jenny: ​Sexily!


Kristin: ​Sexily! And then I think that what happens here is that Giles turns
Ethan down. Like, I think that Giles won’t go the rest of the way. Right? He’s
like – as sexy as Giles will get is possession. [laughs]
Jenny: ​Got it.
Kristin:​ That’s about as sexy as Giles will get with Ethan. And Ethan is
upset. And it starts to form the core piece of Ethan that will, you know, tie
Buffy to a ta – you know, these things that Ethan will do –
Jenny: ​Wow, this is quite a tale!
Kristin: ​I’m convinced! I’m not even – I will hear no other stories. This is
the one for me. This is the truth.
Jenny: ​All right! Well, it’s good to know where you stand.
Kristin: ​That’s where I stand! Anyway, congratulations to the
earliest-winning sexual tension award couple.
Jenny: ​Yes! Pick up your trophy at the front desk as soon as the episode’s
over.
Kristin: ​Giles and Ethan Rayne. Great. So, yes, go ahead, Jenny.
Jenny: ​Guy! With briefcase! On high school campus! At night!​ ​Also, who’s
that hipster janitor with the mutton chops?
Kristin: ​Right? I love the janitor. The janitor does a great job. We are not
talking to the janitor in this episode, but we are going to get some time with
Stuart McLean, who played Phillip Henry in this episode.
Jenny: ​Woo!
Kristin: ​And whose face, if you watch the DVDs, is the only face that shows
in the, like, holding screen before you hit “play.”
Jenny:​ Oh yeah, the still image of him with his reanimated, open eyes, alit
with the light of Eyghon the demon. Woo!


Kristin: ​Yeah. And we’re very excited that Stuart was able to spend some
time with us, so in a little while, we’ll share with you part of that interview.
And I do want to just say, I don’t think we’ve talked about the DVD menu.
Jenny: ​We haven’t talked about it one time?
Kristin: ​I don’t think so. We’ve talked about it to each other.
Jenny: ​Yo. If you’re not watching the DVDs, particularly for Season 2,
you’re missing out on something very special that was popular in the early
2000s, which is a CGI, complicated video progression that leads you from
the main menu to the episode-specific menu. There’s like this music that’s
like, [sings fast-paced, descending tune].
Kristin: ​And then like, “clunk!” And then like, doors open! And it’s like
[creaking noise] –
Jenny: ​And you like, glide through the cemetery, past this tomb and that
tomb, and like, through the legs of the female angel statue, I think? And
then you come to rest, framed on an antique lock that looks like only a
skeleton key would fit in it, and then the episode title comes into focus from
a cloud of magical mist. [Kristin laughs] It’s really something!
Kristin: ​It’s really special.
Jenny: ​I wonder if they’re like, on YouTube. If anybody’s taken the time to
–
Kristin: ​Well, you know, there’s a lot of rumors a-flying about Netflix and
their possession – speaking of possessions – of ​Buffy the Vampire Slayer
because we have heard many a tweet telling us that people who have
watched it on Netflix are seeing that it is leaving and there’s a panic. There
is a panic! A scramble for the DVDs that are expensive, ‘cause there’s a
limited – I don’t even know. It’s just a whole thing.
Jenny: ​Well, I bet they’re gonna do some kind of special box for the 20th
anniversary.


Kristin: ​Yes, exactly.
Jenny: ​Guess how many copies of the entire series of ​Buffy the Vampire
Slayer​ on DVD we’re gonna have after that comes out?
Kristin: ​Are we gonna have two?
Jenny: ​Yes.
Kristin: ​Wow, wow. So, you know, the library –
Jenny: ​Some things in life are more important... than other things in life.
Kristin: ​Okay. The library of Jenny and Kristin will be able to loan out our
first set –
Jenny: ​[yells] No!
Kristin:​ Okay.
Jenny:​ No! That will become –
Kristin: ​That is selfish!
Jenny: ​A vintage relic that we must protect!
Kristin:​ Oh boy. Okay, so anyhow, are you gonna be alright? Are you going
to make it?
Jenny: ​I’m gonna make it!
Kristin: ​Somebody suggested to us on Twitter that if you can acquire a DVD
player, you might be able to go to your local library and rent the DVDs, so
that you can watch them if you are sad about –
Jenny: ​If the scads of other –
Kristin: ​I’m not convinced it’s gonna go. I’m not –


Jenny: ​Buffering the Vampire Slayer​ listeners haven’t already taken it out
from the library.
Kristin: ​Right, you gotta get there now, run!
Jenny: ​Don’t walk.
Kristin: ​Just pause the episode. Go get the DVD!
Jenny: ​Go! Shoo!
Kristin: ​[laughs] What was I gonna say? Oh, I’m not convinced that it’s
gonna go away.
Jenny: ​Yeah, we’ll see.
Kristin: ​We’ll see what happens.
Jenny: ​Yeah, that might just be the – when the option is up, and then –
Kristin: ​And they might be toying with our emotions, they might be saying,
“Well, we heard about this new podcast that’s making everybody rewatch
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.​” It has nothing to do with the 20th anniversary.
Jenny: ​Right, I remember the point in ​The X-Files Files ​when this happened
with ​The X-Files, ​which ended up –
Kristin: ​Oh, really?
Jenny: ​Getting picked up again and remaining on Netflix. So hopefully
everything will just remain as it is.
Kristin: ​Okay! See, we have a lot of evidence that says we might still keep
it there. But anyway –
Jenny: ​[loudly] Anyway!
Kristin: ​What’s in the briefcase, Phillip?


Jenny: ​We’ll never know.
Kristin:​ Like, what the fuck is in that briefcase?
Jenny: ​What even happens to that briefcase? We’ll never know!
Kristin: ​Right? Because the police officer, later, she’s like, “He had one
piece of paper.”
Jenny: ​“All he had –”
Kristin: ​No, he had a briefcase! It was silver, and it seemed like it had an
arsenal inside of it.
Jenny: ​Yeah, that’s peculiar.
Kristin: ​Peculiar. I think the cops are in on it. Cops are in on Eyghon.
Jenny: ​Sounds like a thing.
Kristin: ​I don’t know.
Jenny: ​So, he’s running away, we assume either from Diedre or from
impending doom that he just senses.
Kristin: ​Yeah.
Jenny: ​And he finds a door labeled, “Classroom-slash-library.”
Kristin: ​[laughs] I love the person in the props department that was like,
“Meh, eh, that’ll do. That’s good enough.”
Jenny: ​Yeah. And he’s all, bang-bang-bang-bang-bang, and he sees Diedre,
who moves at the speed of a zombie –
Kristin: ​And yet has somehow gotten across the Atlantic Ocean.
Jenny: ​[whines]​ ​I wanna know! I want to know!


Kristin: ​Right? How did that happen? Actually, someone tweeted that at us,
and it made me think, “You’re right, tweeter!”
Jenny: ​It’s a great question.
Kristin: ​Great question!
Jenny: ​So many great questions. That’s one of them.
Kristin: ​How did this person –? If you ever want to tweet us questions –
Jenny: ​Maybe she immediately, like, before the decomp really kicked in – or
maybe she just, like, hid in the belly of the plane or something.
Kristin: ​Oh, like it happened on the boat? Why did I think she took a boat?
Jenny: ​Maybe she took a boat? No, ‘cause decomp – boats aren’t that fast,
so.
Kristin: ​Right, ‘cause she would – yeah, but – [sighs]
Jenny: ​And she got all the way to California.
Kristin: ​See? Yet another episode, yet another backstory episode of ​Buffy
the Vampire Slayer, ​the story of Diedre. [Jenny laughs] The fuck? The fuck
happened to Diedre? How’d she get over there? Did she follow him? Was she
in the underbelly of the plane? Like, what’s happening? I need to know!
Jenny: ​Right, right. So Phillip Henry’s banging on that
classroom-slash-library door, but Buffy and Giles don’t hear him because
Buffy is aerobicizing!
Kristin: ​Oh! If you are a child of the 90s, you know that every person in
your entire orbit had one of those fucking aerobicise steps. The steppers!
The little steppers with the rubber –
Jenny: ​A little stip-step, mm-hmm.


Kristin: ​Wrapped in a little bit of ridged rubber so that you won’t lose your
aerobicise footing.
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​And she’s going for it. I was so excited about this scene ‘cause it – I
forgot all about, like, the rage of aerobicizing.
Jenny: ​Right, that was a real thing.
Kristin: ​People were so – imagine like, that be – it’s like, “You know what?
We have a great invention.”
Jenny: ​“It’s a step.”
Kristin: ​"It is a step that is one inch off the ground.​ ​[both laugh] And you
just put it in your house, and then you pop the aerobicise DVD in, and then
off to town you go!”
Jenny: ​Uh-huh.
Kristin: ​And I love that Buffy was doing this because I do have to say that I
remember aerobicizing in the nineties, I remember my parents, my friends’
parents – it was a mom thing. I didn’t participate in aerobicizing, did you?
Jenny: ​[laughs] [sarcastically] Please.
Kristin: ​No aerobicizing?
Jenny: ​Uh, no.
Kristin: ​I know that you have quite a DVD collection of exercise materials,
Jenny, so...
Jenny: ​Um, [pause] those did not exist in my life in the 90s –
Kristin: ​Okay.
Jenny: ​And none of them are aerobicization-based.


Kristin: ​Okay! Well, no shame to those who aerobicized, though.
Jenny: ​No! Certainly not.
Kristin: ​It’s just not a Jenny –
Jenny: ​It’s just not on-brand for me.
Kristin: ​It’s not. Also, Giles has this great line during the aerobicizing scene.
I mean, Giles just has a great everything during the aerobicizing scene, but
he says – you know, he’s like, complaining about the music and he can’t
hear anything and he doesn’t know that what he can’t – he actually never
knows that what he didn’t hear was Stuart being... possessed?
Jenny: ​Right, even the police, they’re not like, “He died right outside of your
door.”
Kristin: ​[laughing] “He was found outside your door!” Yeah, like, what the
fuck, guys? But he ends his thought, Giles does, by saying, you know, “This
music, you just keep doing what you’re doing while my brain dribbles out of
my ear.” And I thought that was a nice little seed planted by the writing
room.
Jenny: ​Right, right, because just before or just after that, we see Diedre
turn into blue goo.
Kristin: ​Just after that, because I have written after the quote, “Blue
gooooooooo!” I wrote it twice ‘cause we will see it again. And as – and we
will get to Stuart’s interview, but we do hear him talk a little bit about this
scene and the detail that went into getting that blue goo to line up with him
and Diedre. So that’s fun.
Jenny: ​[suggestively] Then Giles has a dream!​ ​[Kristin laughs]​ ​Giles has
several dreams over the course of this episode.
Kristin: ​Are you into those dreams, Jenny?


Jenny: ​They’re great! I mean, you talked while we were watching it about
how many scenes were, like, easily matched up to various Freddy Krueger
scenes? And there’s something about the quality of those dreams that
reminds me, just of the sort of like, that genre? Like, I feel like those –
Kristin: ​Oh, interesting. Yeah, the dream sequences didn’t remind me of
that series, but certainly dreams, I mean.
Jenny: ​Well, sure, sure, sure. But just like, general horror movies made for
teenagers, that’s exactly the sort of –
Kristin: ​Yeah, the quick cuts, and the, like, crossfades.
Jenny: ​And the like, sort of, warped look of the images and...
Kristin: ​Yeah, and this is the first moment that we see the inside of Giles’
house.
Jenny: ​[sings] Ba-dah!
Kristin: ​Giles is in bed!
Jenny: ​He wakes up in a bed!
Kristin: ​He wakes up in a bed that is Giles’ bed! Giles got a bed this
episode. Giles also got a living room and a desk and a kitchen!
Jenny: ​Later, he sleeps on the floor, inexplicably.
Kristin: ​A rug! He has some rugs! He has a door!
Jenny: ​Yeah, no green mug yet.
Kristin: ​No fucking green mug, we’re still waiting on the green mug.
Jenny: ​But it could appear at any moment.
Kristin: ​But yeah, Giles gets a whole situation, a whole thing.
Congratulations, Giles. Happy to see where you live. And then right after


Giles’ spoo-oo-ky dream, we cut to [laughs] Buffy and Willow playing this
game of “I’d rather be anywhere but here.” And I bring it up mostly for two
reasons. One, because Gavin Rossdale gets a mention!
Jenny: ​Uh-huh.
Kristin: ​Seems like Buffy and I have the same taste in men.
Jenny: ​Oh, boy. Does anybody not have Gavin-Rossdale-in-1997 taste in
men?
Kristin: ​I don’t know, good question. Nobody in this room, apparently.
Jenny: ​Mm-hmm.
Kristin: ​Buffy likes Gavin Rossdale. Willow probably likes Gavin Rossdale.
The other part of this is that Xander strolls up... drinking a juice box.
Jenny: ​Ohhh, wow.
Kristin: ​This is a thing. They drink juice boxes. This is not the first juice box
we’ve seen. And I want to know if you drank juice boxes in high school.
Jenny: ​I sure can’t remember drinking a juice box in high school.
Kristin: ​Right? I can’t either, but it made me remember that when I was in
high school, I ate baby food.
Jenny: ​Ew.
Kristin: ​I ate baby food, I thought it was –
Jenny: ​I mean, no offense to babies, but like –
Kristin: ​I thought it was the coolest thing. It was like, the applesauce baby
food, you know, it was like, the fruit stuff. But I would, like, bring my lunch
box and it would have baby food, and I loved it.
Jenny: ​You are the weirdest –


Kristin: ​I would sit – so, actually, funnily enough, one of my very favorite
high school teachers, Mr. Heitkamp, listens to our show –
Jenny: ​Mr. Heitkamp!
Kristin: ​Mr. Heitkamp! And we saw Mr. Heitkamp last we were in upstate
New York, and it is in – my biggest baby-food-eating memories take place in
Mr. Heitkamp’s classroom because he had a special – you know, probably a
lot of you had this cool teacher who had a couch in his classroom, where you
could hang out with your friends and just be yourselves.
Jenny: ​Mm-hmm.
Kristin: ​[laughs] And that’s what Mr. Heitkamp had, he had a couch in the
back of his room, and so instead of eating lunch in the lunchroom, a lot of us
artsy kids would gather in Mr. Heitkamp’s room and sort of like, hang out on
the couches in the little nook area.
Jenny: ​Wow.
Kristin: ​And I would eat my baby food [laughing] because I was cool! I
shopped at Hot Topic, had baby food, had some fangs, and I went to the
Salvation Army a lot.
Jenny: ​Wow. Oh boy.
Kristin: ​Get over it.
Jenny: ​Yeah, good thing you had fangs to help you cut through that baby
food.
Kristin: ​[laughs] Good one, Jenny.
Jenny: ​So, anyway!
Kristin: ​So anyway. Oh, another important part of this is that this moment
between Buffy and Willow and Xander, they’re discussing Giles, and Giles
and his past.


Jenny: ​Right, and how uptight he must have always been since the dawn of
time.
Kristin: ​Yes, so uptight, his diapers were probably made of tweed.
Jenny: ​And speaking of tweed, now is a great time for us to introduce our
favorite and only Buffy Fashion Watch correspondent, Kate Leth.
[Buffy Fashion Watch intro jingle plays]
It’s time for our friend Kate
To give you the Buffy fashion update.
Kate: ​Welcome back to Buffy Fashion Watch. I’ve returned to my tiny corner
of the podcast. This episode has a couple of really great looks, notably
Willow’s hair is getting cuter and more stylized by degrees, and her clothing
is getting greener by verdigris. But this is a Giles episode, and even though I
rarely talk about the men’s outfits in this show, Giles’ hotness should be
addressed, specifically his suits. Now, Buffy opens this episode with a crack
about Giles being so repressed, his diapers must have been made of tweed.
But I think we all know no human being makes a tweed suit work like
Anthony Stewart Head.
It’s interesting. Tweed ends up as a punchline, but it’s a pretty incredible
and storied fabric. For instance, did you know that, like tartans’ or family
crests, specific tweed patterns belong to specific families, like, even now?
The heavy, woven, woolen fabric was particularly sought-after during a time
before indoor heating and was worn during golfing and hunting and other
outdoor activities because it stood up to inclement weather. And even the
gaudiest patterns kind of blend in with nature, it’s a weird camouflage.
[laughs]
Now, tweed is a word with several possible origins, including the mistyping
of the word “twill,” which is a way that fabric is put together, and a river of
the same name. But it’s divided up into many different types. Some are
named for the kinds of sheep used for the wool, some for their regions of
origin, and then they also have styles on top of it, which you can also see in
fabrics other than tweed.


My personal favorite styles – Giles wears both of these at different points in
time – are herringbone, which has opposing diagonal columns and is named
for its resemblance to the bones of a fish, and houndstooth, which is named
for its jagged diagonal points, which resemble the back teeth of hunting
dogs. Both of which, when you break them down, are like, pretty goth. I’m
sorry, guys. I’ve got a need for tweed!
Did that make you groan? I’m really sorry, let’s take a moment and step
back to when Jenny Calendar was teasing Giles about making him ​squirm​? I
still think about that on at least a weekly basis. Whoo boy. Until next time,
I’ll see you at the mall.
[Buffy Fashion Watch outro jingle plays]
That was our friend Kate
She gave you the Buffy fashion update.
Kristin: ​Thank you, Kate. Holy shit. That is definitely one of my favorite
ones of all time! We learned so much about tweed!
Jenny: ​Yes, thank you.
Kristin: ​So much about tweed, I love it! Also, fucking herringbone, and – I
just – great job all around. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. You know who
I do not want to thank?
Jenny: ​Who’s that?
Kristin: ​I do not want to thank Jenny Calendar in this episode.
Jenny: ​No!
Kristin: ​I do not – I’m not a fan of Jenny Calendar in this episode.
Jenny: ​It’s too much!
Kristin: ​Right? Like, I know later, I recuse her –
Jenny: ​Later, there’s a demon. In her body.


Kristin: ​I recuse her later because she’s possessed by a demon, but let me
tell you what, she’s being just as fucking creepy before the demon was in
her body.
Jenny: ​I do really like her, “Oh, I had to dog-ear all the pages –”
Kristin: ​Yes.
Jenny: ​“And then I had to underline all the passages, and then I spilled
coffee all over your book!” as Giles gets more and more stressed out.
Because in that scenario, I’m Giles.
Kristin: ​Right, yes. Of course, and that’s a great moment. Great, great
moment. And then, Giles has an unfortunate line.​ ​[Jenny laughs]​ ​“I trust I
gave good squirm.”
Jenny: ​Sick!
Kristin: ​No thank you, take it back! And then they kiss! In school!
Jenny: ​She has so many creepy lines. You can’t kiss in school!
Kristin: ​No kissing in school!
Jenny: ​[yelling] The bell already rang, what are you doing?
Kristin: ​What are you possibly doing? Both of you. Get it together.
Jenny: ​Too. Sexy.
Kristin: ​Too sexy for school. T-S-F-S. Too sexy for school. And then, and
then. Before they part, Jenny Calendar looks at Giles and says, “I’ll see if I
can make you squirm.”
Jenny: ​[sings] No!
Kristin: ​And I want to vomit! On my shoes! I don't like it, I don't like it, I
don’t like it. It’s too much for me, I’m overwhelmed.


Jenny: ​And let’s be clear. Female sexuality? Feelin’ it.
Kristin: ​Totally!
Jenny: ​So great!
Kristin: ​Yeah. Not like that!
Jenny: ​It’s just –
Kristin: ​It’s not right! [laughs]
Jenny: ​Too much! Be cool, Jenny! You clearly have it!
Kristin: ​And this is – I mean, maybe this is a personal taste, because Kate
made mention of, like, sounding maybe a bit kerfluffled by Jenny Calendar,
and I couldn’t tell if –
Jenny: ​Different strokes.
Kristin: ​If she was into it or not into it completely, but to me, I like the guy
that looks in the other direction, do you know what I mean?
Jenny: ​Yes!
Kristin: ​That’s sexy to me.
Jenny: ​Remember when she was disinterested? Mm. That was great.
Kristin: ​Yeah, got those cigarettes rolled up in your shirt sleeve, standing at
the corner –
Jenny: ​Uh-huh, yeah!
Kristin: ​Maybe you’re into me, maybe you’re not? Maybe the dust is blowing
in the wind?
Jenny: ​[laughs] What?


Kristin: ​I don’t know. I think I fell into ​Dirty Dancing. ​I said cigarettes in an
arm and then I started thinking of Patrick Swayze and there I was, with dust
in the wind.
Jenny: ​Right, right, right, sure.
Kristin: ​[laughing] Okay, anyway, right, listen, we don’t mean to yuck
anybody else’s yum –
Jenny: ​Totally, we’re just telling you what our yum is not, and it’s Jenny
Calendar being super aggressive.
Kristin: ​Very aggressive. I was more afraid of Jenny Calendar in the hallway
of the school than I was when she was possessed by the demon. [laughter]
Okay, good talk. So then [sings] Cordelia –
Jenny: ​Oh my god.
Kristin: ​Cordelia comes in. Cordelia will certainly get her jingle, but not yet.
She has a moment when she earns it for me outright, and I will tell you what
it is when we get there.
Jenny: ​Oh, yeah.
Kristin: ​But she has a great moment. She comes in, talks to the cops.
Wants to get her fucking ticket –
Jenny: ​While they’re interviewing Giles about a homicide, could they take
care of this parking ticket she has? Totally bogus.
Kristin: ​Yes, please? And then she just has this great moment where she’s
just like, “Why is everyone always screaming my name? I can take a hint.
But wait, what’s the hint?”
Jenny: ​[laughs] Really good.
Kristin: ​Love you. Love you, Cordelia! I don’t know if you knew that, but
[sings] I love you!


Jenny: ​Doing great. And then it’s off to the morgue to ID a dead body,
hooray! I have questions.
Kristin: ​Yes.
Jenny: ​Philip Henry’s dead body is covered in –
Kristin: ​Bruises!
Jenny: ​Purple bruises. And I want to know – I know somebody out there
works in a morgue. I wanna know, is that a common post-mortem – is that
–?
Kristin: ​Post-mortem.
Jenny: ​Am I using “post-mortem” correctly?
Kristin: ​Yeah, after death.
Jenny: ​Mmm, wait, isn’t “posthum –” Oh boy. Listen, it doesn’t matter. After
you die, is your body covered in bruises? I need to know.
Kristin: ​“Jenny Needs to Know.” A new segment. [both laugh] “Jenny Needs
to Know.” Right, and so yeah, he’s covered in bruises. Giles IDs his body,
right? That’s what happens here?
Jenny: ​Mm-hmm. He says, “Yeah, that’s Philip Henry, no, I’ve never seen
that tattoo before.”
Kristin: ​Yeah, said in a way –
Jenny: ​Detective Detective is like, “Umm... I think you’re lying?”
Kristin: ​[laughing] Is that her name? Detective Detective?
Jenny: ​It is now.


Kristin: ​[laughs] By the way, I loved Detective Detective. So much so that I
made Jenny look up Detective Detective and who she was. And it turns out
that her name is Carlease, spelled like you leased a car. “C-A-R-L-E-A-S-E.”
Carlease.
Jenny: ​Yeah, Carlease Burke portraying Detective Winslow, not Detective
Detective, as I had hoped.
Kristin: ​But like, Detective Detective, it’s stuck. It’s with me. Um, so, right,
so Giles is at the morgue. And then we cut to Buffy, ‘cause what we haven’t
talked about yet is that it’s blood transfusion night at the hospital, or
wherever the fuck – [laughs]
Jenny: ​“Everybody knows it’s delivery night.”
Kristin: ​Everybody knows. So yeah, but Giles is late. And that’s like, the big
deal. But you wanna know something else I love? Is vampires under cover.
[Jenny laughs]​ ​I love –
Jenny: ​[grand, obvious voice] “Hello, just two doctors, ready to accept your
blood delivery. Trust us!”
Kristin: ​[laughing] I just love thinking about them being like, “What do you
think a doctor says? I don’t know, man, like, blah blah blah.” Just like, being
really worried that maybe they’re gonna fuck it up by not being convincing
enough as doctors?
Jenny: ​Uh-huh.
Kristin: ​But they were convincing enough. I feel like, probably the guy who
delivers the blood should probably know by now, like, yeah, Sunnydale
seems a little bit privy to the fact that there are vampires and demons
around, you’d think that this guy would know.
Jenny: ​Yeah. Maybe he’s just trying to do his job and paid, man.
Kristin: ​Or maybe it’s an inside job.
Jenny: ​Maybe?


Kristin: ​Maybe it’s a fucking inside job.
Jenny: ​So they get the cooler of blood. Up pulls the getaway convertible
from behind, like, in the shadows by the dumpster. And then one of the fake
doc vampires like, bites into a bag and somebody’s like, “No sampling the
product,” introducing what I believe is the first drug reference in the
episode, but not the last.
Kristin: ​Mm-hmm.
Jenny: ​And so this – I have another question! Or series of questions.
Kristin: ​Yes! “Jenny Needs to Know.”
Jenny: ​How much blood do vampires need to survive?
Kristin: ​Does a bloodchuck chuck for –
Jenny: ​How much blood does a bloodchuck chuck if a bloodchuck does
chuck blood? [Kristin laughs] And why do some vampires want to drink
donated blood? Is it purified in some way that like –
Kristin: ​[intrigued] Ohhh! I didn’t even think about that.
Jenny: ​Makes it sort of taste different? Angel’s the only vampire I can think
of who wouldn’t just go out and eat some people.
Kristin:​ Yeah, and also where does Angel get his blood? Like, he seems like
he’s – you know what? I bet you Angel is like, “Sure, I’ll take care of it,” and
takes some of the fucking blood! [Jenny laughs] Where else is he getting his
blood from?​ ​Do we learn – ohhh, I think we do learn later.
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​Okay, fine.
Jenny: ​So, moving –


Kristin: ​Fine, fine, fine. Moving right along.
Jenny: ​How about Buffy’s fighting the vampire, she’s up on the hood of the
convertible –
Kristin: ​[into it] Yeah!
Jenny: ​And then she almost stakes Angel, and then she’s like, “Angel!” And
all the other vampire that she’s fighting politely pause [Kristin laughs] so she
can recognize Angel and Angel can recognize her, and then Angel’s like,
[yells] “Look out!” And then he proceeds to jump on top of the roof of the
car, or the hood of the car, I should say. And then leap, like, twenty feet
forward to where the imminent threat is –
Kristin: ​Also –
Jenny: ​He tackles the vampire that’s farthest away from Buffy after yelling
“Look out.”
Kristin: ​Also, to end this beautiful tale that you have started, Buffy stakes
two vampires. Guess what happens to the ​one ​that Angel was in charge of?
He gets in the car and he drives away!
Jenny: ​[laughs] Speaking of inside jobs!
Kristin: ​The fuck you doing, Angel? You had one vamp to kill! You making a
big show. He just wanted to see Buffy, he didn’t fucking care.
Jenny: ​Awww.
Kristin: ​He just wanted to see Buffy!
Jenny: ​“Everybody knows it’s delivery night.”
Kristin: ​Make eyes at Buffy. So yeah, my note was, “Buffy slays two, Angel
zero?” What the fuck.
Jenny: ​It’s a rough score.


Kristin: ​Um, okay, so Buffy then is like, “I’m concerned about Giles, I gotta
go to his house.” And we’re like, yay, this is the first time Buffy’s going to
Giles’ house.
Jenny: ​Yo, and guess who looks... like an ashtray.
Kristin: ​[laughs] The first time we watched this scene, Jenny was like,
“Wow, Giles, you really grew that beard quick.”
Jenny: ​Yeah! Giles, lookin’ drunk, loose tie, sudden case of beard.​ ​[Kristin
laughs]​ ​Why and how? “Oh, I just drank half a bottle of whiskey, and it
made my beard grow”?
Kristin: ​Yeah, maybe you’ve never drank half a bottle of whiskey, Jenny.
Jenny: ​Oh, I have, believe me. I’ve put in my best efforts.
Kristin: ​No beard for you.
Jenny: ​No beard. Yet.
Kristin: ​But I do want to say that – so Giles is like “Get the fuck out.” Giles’s
whole energy towards Buffy for most of this episode is “go away.”
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​And that’s very upsetting to –
Jenny: ​Go away, ​Mom​.
Kristin: ​Yeah, right?
Jenny: ​Some real role reversal.
Kristin: ​Yeah, big role reversal in this episode. Ugh, we’ll get to that last
scene. Don’t worry, we’ll get there. But Anthony Head’s – Anthony Stewart
Head’s acting is incredible in this little scene where he takes a sip of
whiskey. He puts his head in his hand but he does it very quickly and
suddenly – it’s very powerful.


Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​His acting and then he goes over to the mirror. [Jenny laughs]
Yeah, then your favorite moment.
Jenny: ​It’s a little sillier but –
Kristin: ​It’s a little sillier.
Jenny: ​But at the desk, like, just after he crosses the name out of his
notebook.
Kristin: ​“Diedre,” yeah.
Jenny:​ Also, his list of names is clearly for us.
Kristin: ​[laughs] Right.
Jenny: ​“I’ve got – there’s five of us!” [they both laugh]
Kristin: ​Giles, he really has to keep track. He’s like, “well –”
Jenny: ​And last names.
Kristin: ​[laughing] Good call. So then right before the commercial break, if
you will, we cut to the morgue where we see...
Jenny: ​Oh shit, Phillip Henry, reanimated!
Kristin: ​Re-the fuck-animated with some cat eyes or some shit.
Jenny: ​[makes a guitar twang sound] That’s an eye noise.
Kristin: ​And I think this is a great – this is probably a great time for us to
learn some more about Phillip Henry and the guy behind Phillip Henry,
Stuart McLean.
Jenny: ​Hooray!


[Interview intro music plays]
Kristin: ​So the first thing that we talked to Stuart about was his experience
of shooting this episode of ​Buffy ​and what it was like for him personally.
Here’s some of what he had to share with us.
Stuart: ​This is one of the shoots that I think most fondly of is the ​Buffy
shoot because it did pay an awful lot of money, that was one reason I feel
fondly of it. [Kristin and Jenny laugh] But also, it was just such an easy
shoot and really actually, even from the point of view of like, not a lot of
pressure on me ‘cause most of the time, I was a zombie. So I didn’t have a
lot of lines to learn, you know, or anything like that, it was just kind of like –
Jenny: ​Right, right.
Stuart: ​And it was kind of fun. I remember on this shoot at that time, my
main drive – my only drive at that time was a 1967 convertible Mustang.
Kristin: ​Ooooh.
Stuart: ​And my girlfriend came on the set one time and she took photos of
me in full costume and makeup. You know, bits of me rotting off my face
and everything, driving my Mustang. So I thought that was –
Jenny: ​[high-pitched] Oh my god.
Kristin: ​Wow, wow. You don’t happen to still have those photos, do you?
Those would be incredible.
Stuart: ​Probably, yeah, they’re around somewhere.
Kristin: ​Oh well, if you find them, please send them to us. Our listeners
would love to see those.
Stuart: ​Yeah, absolutely, I’ll take a look ‘cause I’d like to find them. Now
that I was thinking about them, I was like, “Oh, I loved that car”, you know?
Jenny: ​Stuart, could you tell us a little about the audition process?


Stuart: ​It was a studio in Culver City where they shoot the main sets. I
went in and they asked me – the director was there. One part of the audition
was he wanted to see me, how I would behave as a zombie.
Jenny: ​Yes!
Kristin: ​[laughs]
Stuart: ​So I had to do my best zombie walk and zombie look and I think
that’s what sold them on it, so.
Jenny: ​You have a very convincing zombie walk, for sure.
Stuart: ​Oh good, well, thank you very much, yes. I’ve – and who knew that
there would be so many opportunities for it in the future, you know? ‘Cause
just about every other show these days is a zombie show, so that’s really
fantastic, you know?
Kristin: ​[laughs] At least they didn’t tell you – at least they didn’t ask you
to turn into goo. That would have probably been a little bit more difficult for
you.
Stuart: ​Yeah, that was the first and only time I’ve been killed by turning to
blue goo. [laughter] But I have been killed a lot of funny ways, I’ll tell you. I
got killed once by telepaths on ​Babylon 5​.
Jenny: ​What?
Stuart: ​Telepaths killed me by basically throwing things at me through the
air, pipes and chairs and such.
Kristin: ​Wow.
Jenny: ​Oh my god.
Stuart: ​So I’ve been killed a lot of ways you know? [Jenny laughs] That’s
pretty much my career is getting killed at some point. [They all laugh]


Kristin: ​We did something fun for this interview. We asked our listeners,
that’s you, on Facebook and Twitter for questions to ask Stuart and here’s
what he had to say in response to a couple of those listener questions.
Kristin: ​So Stuart, on Twitter, Clarissa asks, “how long did it take to do your
makeup?”
Stuart: ​I was in makeup probably – it depends on which day but as they
sort of rotted me through, it took a few hours to apply the makeup. And
particularly the scene where I was – the morgue scene, ‘cause they had to
do the full body for that.
Jenny: ​Oh, yeah.
Kristin: ​Right.
Stuart: ​But that’s one of the reasons I got paid so well on this show because
I had forced turnarounds all the time because I had to kind of be back at 5
am for makeup. And so you know, if we were shooting in the evening or
whatever, then I’d end up having what they call a forced turnaround which is
like less than eight hours between – I think it’s eight hours –
Kristin: ​Oh wow.
Stuart: ​Between sort of leaving the set and having to be back on it. Oh yes
and of course we forgot the Mark of Eyghon. The Mark of Eyghon was –
Jenny: ​Yes.
Stuart: ​That was another bit of the makeup, wasn’t it? I liked that thing. I
wanted to actually get it, you know, permanently tattooed onto me, I
thought it was pretty cool.
Kristin: ​But then what if, you know? Like what if that mark actually...
[laughing]
Jenny: ​Invited a demon to occupy you.
Stuart: ​Yeah, yeah. I didn’t do it so...


Jenny:​ We’ll never know.
Kristin: ​Right, yeah. You can’t be too careful about these things. [laughter]
Jenny: ​We have another question from a listener. Leah on Facebook wanted
to know: “what’s it like to go onto a show with an established bonded cast in
a one-off role where you ultimately, of course, get turned into goo?”
Stuart: ​Well you know, with the kind of career that I’ve had, that’s pretty
much what I’m doing all the time. I’m always – and getting onto a show
that’s kind of been running for a while. I was on​ ER​ for about three seasons,
kind of intermittently on ​ER​. I was the X-ray guy on that and you know, it’s
always – when a show’s really cranking along, it’s kind of a little bit like
jumping onto a moving train, you know? Because people are so good and so
adept and so not nervous and all that kind of stuff, because of course,
they’ve been there for weeks and weeks and weeks.
Jenny:​ Right.
Stuart:​ And eventually, everyone gets nervous the first time on the set, first
time you go on a stage, whatever. There’s always a nerve factor. I gotta
say, the ​Buffy ​gang, it was a really fun gang, you know? And they were very
welcoming. Pretty much all shows are very welcoming, the good ones,
because everybody’s happy to be on ‘em and everybody’s kind of on a high
from creating this thing and ​Buffy ​was a really good show. It was just a fun
show to shoot and it was fun to be in the company of those people who were
kind of like – I think that was the second season. You know, so they were
really kind of – they didn’t quite know, but it was probably hitting the height
of its popularity at that time.
Kristin: ​Right, right, totally. Do you have any stories in particular that you
remember as the stick out story when you were on set in that role?
Stuart: ​On this show, I gotta say, it was the first time I’ve ever in a morgue
drawer, you know?
Jenny: ​Oh yeah, that seems...


Kristin: ​That does not seem fun.
Stuart: ​That was pretty creepy, I have to say. That was very creepy, just to
kind of be slid in and out of that thing over and over again.
Jenny: ​Oh man.
Stuart: ​You know, being in the cage thing when I was kind of trapped in the
cage. And you know, they’re all having a discussion about me while I’m
inside that cage kind of growling in the background. [Kristin laughs]
Jenny: ​Right, right.
Stuart: ​And of course, the fight scene. The fight scene was quite – you
know? Because of course, you’re all padded up. You have pads on
underneath your clothing and all that kind of stuff.
Jenny: ​Really?
Stuart: ​Yeah, because you’re doing it over and over again.
Jenny: ​Right.
Stuart: ​It’s not like it would be so bad to hit the ground once or twice but
you know, you’re doing it ten, fifteen, twenty times, maybe.
Jenny: ​Wow.
Stuart: ​Because they’re shooting it from one side, then the other side, and
then a little bit of it and a close up here and – the blue goo thing I think they
had to – I can’t remember how they did that, I’m trying to think. But there
was a lot of special photography to kind of set that up. Because when I got
touched with her blue goo, we were laying on the ground forever. [They all
laugh] Me and Diedre. Me and Diedre were laying on the ground, you know?
Remember, this is – you’re talking about – you know, there were barely
computers then, you know?
Kristin: ​Right.


Stuart: ​I think I might have gotten my first cell phone at that point. Yeah, I
think I pretty much had my cell phone ‘cause I had my cellphone when I got
my ‘67 convertible Mustang so I had the cell phone. [Kristin and Jenny
laugh] It was a big brick of a thing, you know what I mean? I remember
when I first got it, I was driving up Pacific Coast Highway and I called
somebody, it was like – crazily expensive, but I called somebody in Britain
‘cause I just wanted to gloat, you know? [they all laugh] And I was like,
“yeah, I’m driving my convertible up Pacific Coast Highway, how’s it going?”
[laughter]
Jenny: ​Stuart, where can people find you and your work on the internet?
Stuart: ​Well, on Twitter, I’m at @sirstuartmclean.
Jenny: ​Great.
Kristin: ​Perfect.
Stuart: ​I gave myself a knighthood for that particular...
Jenny: ​After so many deaths, I think you’ve earned it.
Kristin: ​Yeah.
Stuart: ​Exactly. And also I have a film coming up in April. It’s premiering at
the Phoenix Film Festival and it’s called ​The Midnighters​.
Kristin: ​The Midnighters​, okay. We’ll be on the lookout for that.
Jenny: ​Yeah, that’s premiering at the Phoenix Film Festival, you said?
Stuart: ​The Phoenix Film Festival, I think it airs April 7th, 8th, and 9th.
Jenny: ​Great.
Kristin: ​Oh perfect, that’ll be soon enough for this.
Stuart:​ Not airs, screens. Screens at the Festival.


Kristin: ​Well, thank you so much for taking the time out to talk to us. Our
listeners are gonna be so excited to get to hear a little bit of behind the
scenes from you and just to get to hear about you in general, so we so
appreciate it.
Jenny: ​Yeah, thank you so much.
Stuart: ​Wonderful, I’m so glad you helped me relive my ​Buffy ​days, it was
great.
Kristin: ​[laughing]
Jenny: ​Yes!
Kristin: ​[laughing] Of course, any time. We will always help you relive your
Buffy ​days. Thank you.
Stuart: ​Thank you.
[Interview outro music plays]
Kristin: ​Wow, thank you again to Stuart McLean. That was so wonderful to
get the chance to talk to you and we will be posting on our social accounts
some of those pictures that Stuart did in fact send to us of him in his zombie
makeup in that convertible.
Jenny: ​Oh my god.
Kristin: ​You know what just occurred to me?
Jenny: ​What?
Kristin: ​The vampire was in a convertible and Stuart was on set in a – there
were a lot of convertibles.
Jenny: ​Lot of convertibles.
Kristin: ​Very ​Hollywood that day. That day. ‘Cause it takes one day to shoot
an episode [They both laugh]. I’m really good at TV.


Jenny: ​Also... I’ve got one more question! Do morgue people, morgue
employees, regularly check – it’s like the sheet that’s on the back of the
bathroom door at the gas station bathroom –
Kristin: ​Yeah, yeah. 2pm: all the dead people were here.
Jenny: ​Right, 4pm – and if so, if there is such a checklist and that’s
common morgue procedure, how frequent is it? And what’s the
accountability and what’s the occurrence of bodies going missing?
Kristin: ​Can somebody please write my wife –
Jenny: ​Please!
Kristin: ​Please write my wife... not to be confused with Cameron and
Rhea’s…
Jenny: ​Take My Wife​.
Kristin: ​Television show ​Take My Wife.​ Please write my wife and let her
know all about her morgue queries.
Jenny: ​[sighs]
Kristin: ​Um, so…
Jenny: ​It’s just, I feel like this episode raises more questions than it
answers.
Kristin: ​Would you say it raises ​morgue ​questions?
Jenny: ​[laughing] I would have said that if I thought of it fast enough! Ahh!
Kristin: ​Great. So then we go to – we’ve forgotten a very important subplot
of this episode, which is that Xander is not –
Jenny: ​School on Saturday.


Kristin: ​Yeah, Xander and Cordelia are bad at computers and Willow is good
at computers and apparently they’re the only three people who have either –
Jenny: ​Any relationship to computers whatsoever.
Kristin: ​A proficiency or deficiency in computers.
Jenny: ​Everybody else is right in the middle.
Kristin: ​Yep. Everyone else is just average. And so they are in school on a
Saturday. Very​ Breakfast Club​. It’s a very​ Breakfast Club​ episode. So the
real reason that I bring that up is because we’re in school, it’s a Saturday,
Cordelia is wearing a shirt that Kate did not mention, so I shall. It is white, it
has an off-center, and maybe you’d want to call it an asymmetrical neckline.
Jenny: ​Yes.
Kristin: ​And I’m into it and I’m into you. Still not time for your jingle
though, but I’m into you, Cordelia.
Jenny: ​You know what else this scene gives us? The sentence fragment “My
uncle Rory was the stodgiest taxidermist” from Xander and I just want to
say: I love that sentence fragment.
Kristin: ​Oh yeah, it’s good. It’s good. Not to bring us right back to Cordelia
but she does have a great line when she interjects, after they’ve all been
trying to figure out what’s wrong with Giles, to say [Jenny laughs] “No he
seemed perfectly normal yesterday when he was talking to the police.”
Jenny: ​“About a homicide.”
Kristin: ​Well, she doesn’t say “about a homicide” at first, they have to pull it
out of her.
Jenny: ​Right.
Kristin: ​But you know, she’s just – she’s just Cordelia, what are you gonna
do?


Jenny: ​She’s just being her.
Kristin: ​So Buffy’s like, “yo, Jenny, you’re the girlfriend. He won’t talk to
me. Figure it out.” And Jenny is very, like, on their level. Did you have
teachers like that, who were like one of the gang?
Jenny: ​Oh yeah.
Kristin: ​A little ​too much​ part of the gang?
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​Yeah, me too. [laughs] Jenny Calendar is totally that teacher. Jenny
Calendar had that moment with Cordelia, way back when, when they both
almost got killed by the mons – the three-headed Slurpee monster at the
end of Season 1. [laughter] You know what I mean? Where she was like
[imitating Cordelia] “ugh, can you even believe the stains in your clothes?”
And Jenny was rolling her eyes, but she’s very much on the student level.
She’s the young hip teacher.
Jenny: ​Yes.
Kristin: ​Anyway, I’m going on for too long.
Jenny: ​Never too long.
Kristin: ​Buffy goes to the library.
Jenny: ​And we see a nape of a neck that I’d recognize anywhere! It
happens to be attached to none other than Ethan Rayne!
Kristin: ​Ugh, back in our lives, back in our hearts.
Jenny: ​In top form! Sassier than he was on Halloween, even.
Kristin: ​Yeah, yeah. He’s getting stronger and stronger. Also, the fucking
library is huge!
Jenny: ​Really big.


Kristin: ​We saw way more of the library today than we saw –
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​Than we have seen. There’s a set of double doors –
Jenny: ​Yeah, we see the back section.
Kristin: ​He tries to throw a thing on Buffy.
Jenny: ​Yep, yep, yep.
Kristin: ​Buffy’s like, “quit it”. And they have a great – I really love –
Jenny: ​Yeah, I’d like to see a spinoff series.
Kristin: ​Right?
Jenny: ​“Ethan Around.” Oh wait, is that the actual name of the “Horsin’
Around” spinoff that they try to make in “BoJack Horseman”?
Kristin: ​Oh, because the guy’s name is Ethan?
Jenny: ​Yeah. Carry on.
Kristin: ​Yeah. I would also like to see that spinoff. So Ethan Rayne is in the
library, oh my god. Buffy grabs him and he’s like, “Giles was my friend and I
wanted to have sex with him and he turned me down.”
Jenny: ​[laughing] Well, he doesn’t say that.
Kristin: ​He does not say that.
Jenny: ​It’s important to include that he ​didn’t ​say that.
Kristin: ​But he did with his eyes.
Jenny: ​Ooo-kay.


Kristin: ​Anyway and Buffy calls Giles and is like, “Giles, I’ve got your buddy
here.” And Giles is like, “he’s very dangerous” as Giles smokes a cigarette
and drinks seven different cocktails. [They both laugh] And then they think
it’s just a trio here, Ethan and Giles and Buffy, but no. In comes zombie-man
Phillip Henry.
Jenny: ​Yes, in busts Phillip through the window. A lot of windows getting
decimated in this episode.
Kristin: ​Yeah. And then in come the Scoobies. It’s a whole hullabaloo. Giles
–
Jenny: ​Cordelia kicks Ethan.
Kristin: ​My favorite. My favorite moment – no sorry, it’s not my favorite
moment.
Jenny: ​Second favorite moment.
Kristin: ​Second favorite moment. Right, Cordelia kicks Ethan – wait, Ethan?
Is that who she kicks?
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​She kicks Ethan, right. Ugh, another great combo, Cordelia and
Ethan.
Jenny: ​Uh huh.
Kristin: ​They would – I would love to watch them have a cup of coffee
together.
Jenny: ​Yeah or like, go shopping.
Kristin: ​Oh yeah, good call. Is that a ster – are you stereotyping Ethan
because he’s a gay man in my analysis?


Jenny: ​[laughing] No, I just – he’s very – they’re both just very forward and
I feel like clothes is the department where I’ve seen Cordelia have the most
to say and it just seems natural.
Kristin: ​Yeah, that’s fair. So Giles apparently lives very close to school
because Giles is like, “oh no, I hear trouble” and –
Jenny: ​And then busts in through the library doors minutes later.
Kristin: ​Busts through the double doors. The other double doors. There’s a
whole big fight which we heard Stuart talk a little bit about, the fight scene.
Jenny: ​Right, right. He goes in the cage, he busts out of the cage. Buffy
kicks in him the throat or something? And then he falls down and turns into
goo but Jenny Calendar’s already unconscious...
Kristin: ​The door knocks Jenny Calendar out, is that what happens? The
door hits her? I didn’t understand how she got knocked out.
Jenny: ​Who can keep track?
Kristin: ​Right? She gets knocked out, Ethan Rayne runs away, Phillip Henry
turns to blue goo, the blue goo touches Jenny and then Jenny hugs Giles and
then she opens her eyes and she is possessed by the spirit. And only we
know that. Yes, Jenny?
Jenny: ​I was further disturbed by post knockout Jenny being like extreme
bedroom Jenny.
Kristin: ​Mm-hmm.
Jenny: ​There is no – [stutters] Like way that she says “prom –” [makes
grossed out sound].
Kristin: ​The way that she says what?
Jenny: ​“Promise?”
Kristin: ​“Promise”...


Jenny: ​Where he’s like “lean on me” and she’s like [sexily] “Mmm, kay.”
[Kristin laughs] And then he’s like, “everything’s alright now” and she’s like
“promise?” And he’s like “yeah.” Little does he know that that’s not
something he ​can ​promise. And so on.
Kristin: ​Right. Then we come back...
Jenny: ​Well, yeah. And Buffy’s all like, “WTF is going on?” and Giles is all
like, “stay out of it!” and Buffy’s all like “Avengers assemble!” and then she’s
like, “Willow, here’s your task” and then she’s like, “Xander, here’s your
task.”
Kristin: ​And then. Here is the moment. [Jenny laughs] And then my sweet
Cordelia hops off of her perch and smiles the best smile I’ve ever seen her
do.
Jenny: ​Oh yeah.
Kristin: ​To this day. “What about me, Buffy?” [laughs]
Jenny: ​Yeah, “I’m ready for my assignment. I’m one of the gang.”
Kristin: ​And she says, “what about me? I care about Giles.” And I just want
to kiss her face, all around her face. Not even in a sexy way, I just want to
kiss her all over her face because I love her so much.
Jenny: ​Oh.
Kristin: ​You’re okay with it.
Jenny: ​Okay.
Kristin: ​It’s great.
Jenny: ​[laughing] Okay.
Kristin: ​Cordelia, I love you. Here is your jingle.


[Cordelia’s jingle plays]
Cordelia (ah-ahh)
I love you, Cordelia (ah-ahh)
You’re perfect, Cordelia (ah-ahh)
Jenny: ​Ah yes. We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again. If you want to
wake up to the dulcet tones of me singing about Cordelia, you can go on
your iPhone, go into the iTunes store, and search for ‘Cordelia’ and you’ll
find it as a ringtone. You’re welcome.
Kristin: ​You will find it there. So now we’re at Giles’s house, right?
Jenny: ​Yeah, we’re cutting back and forth between Giles’s house and the
Scoobies doing research.
Kristin: ​Yeah and at Giles’s house, we learn that Eyghon knows how phones
work.
Jenny: ​Oh yeah.
Kristin: ​Which I thought was interesting that –
Jenny: ​Well, Eyghon was occupying their bodies, you know, 20 years prior
or whatever –
Kristin: ​And just taking notes? Like, “oh, interesting. This goes here…”
Jenny: ​Probably, just like the... Inca mummy princess.
Kristin: ​Right. So, you know, Jenny is, as we know, possessed and the
Scoobies are figuring this out. They’re slowly putting the pieces together.
Jenny: ​After they get over the small speed bump of that classic
Egyptian-Etruscan mix up, they put it together pretty quick.
Kristin: ​[laughing] Yeah. How could Willow have been so silly?
Jenny: ​Ugh, god.


Kristin: ​Foolish Willow! But this is where we go into Freddy Krueger
territory, and hard.
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​This was, to date, this episode is a parallel – if I had more time on
my hands, I would do a side-by-side comparison of three things. And I’m
gonna talk about all three of them now even though they happen as the
episode goes on. First of all, right when Jenny – and this is great. Once
Jenny starts really speaking as Eyghon, I mean, I guess she’s been speaking
as Eyghon the whole time. But when it notably shifts is when she stands up
and she’s like, “oh it’s not right, it’s not proper, it’s just –” and she’s
mimicking Giles – she’s mimicking Ripper, right, of olden days. We learn a
little bit that even though Giles was involved in magicks, it sounds like he
was still kind of cautious and hesitant. Always his nature. Then Eyghon says,
“you’re like a woman, Ripper.” So I don’t know if you know what that is,
Jenny, but that is the patriarchy.
Jenny: ​Oh my god, of course. It is the patriarchy!
Kristin: ​Could you say it right?
Jenny: ​[yells] The patriarchy!
Kristin: ​You have one job with the patriarchy. One job.
Jenny: ​I know. I just have one job?
Kristin: ​No, with the patriarchy specifically.
Jenny: ​Oh, oh, oh.
Kristin: ​To say it right.
Jenny: ​Oh.
Kristin: ​[laughs] And uproot it. That’s all.
Jenny: ​Oh, two jobs.


Kristin: ​[laughing] Anyway. Then Jenny shifts and it’s a closeup on her face
and her face – the way that her face is even done is very Freddy
Krueger-like and her voice changes and she’s like [deep voice] “under your
skin.”
Jenny: ​[laughs]
Kristin: ​And then makes a joke, this is the first Freddy moment. She says
[deep voice] “was it good for you?” Makes that silly, sexy joke ‘cause that’s
– Freddy Krueger’s entire personality is like those stupid jokes where you’re
like, “I get it, Freddy, god, just kill me already,” you know what I mean? And
then, Buffy comes in and is like, “Fuck this noise.” I’ve said “fuck” so many
times, I’m sorry for people who listen with their families. I really gotta rein it
in. But ​Ethan ​Rayne it in.
Jenny: ​Oh my god.
Kristin: ​Buffy comes in and Jenny leaves and she leaves by jumping
through the glass and this is – I swear, I want to find it ‘cause it’s like a shot
by shot from one of the Freddy Kruegers where he jumps through the glass.
The last thing is the door shot – this is later and don’t worry, we’ll come
back, but the door shot when we’re back at Ethan Rayne’s costume shop and
it’s Buffy and Ethan and the shadow of Jenny Calendar, the way that it’s lit
behind her…
Jenny: ​Mmhmm.
Kristin: ​She’s very, very tall and long.
Jenny: ​Yeah, yeah.
Kristin: ​And as she gets to the door, it gets shorter and shorter. That is an
iconic​, iconic piece of ​Nightmare on Elm Street​ for the very first one, there is
a scene where his shadow is so long down the alleyway and then he gets
closer.
Jenny: ​Woo!


Kristin: ​So it is – I was just thrilled by –​ ​[Jenny laughs]​ ​I was really excited
‘cause I mean, I think a lot of the parallels that I’ve talked about before
have been legitimate parallels. But this, I was like, are you kidding me? This
is shot for shot here. Really pulled a lot from ​Nightmare on Elm Street.
[singsong] So I’m excited, I always get excited when I talk about Freddy
Krueger. Okay!
Jenny: ​So after Jenny Calendar-slash-Eyghon jumps out the window, Buffy
and Giles sit down and they have a chat. And Giles tells Buffy what’s going
on and why.
Kristin: ​Yes.
Jenny: ​And he describes for her the ritual of passing out and being
possessed by a demon that he and his friends used to do.
Kristin: ​Yes. “Ethan and I discovered it,” is what he says.
Jenny: ​“Ethan and I discovered it.”
Kristin: ​We were making out and then we figured it out and yeah.
Jenny: ​And he says... that the high was extraordinary. Drugs! Drugs. Did
you ever have your friends make you pass out?
Kristin: ​No but I have friends who – like, I didn’t do that, but my best friend
before we became best friends had like –
Jenny: ​A circle of pass-out friends?
Kristin: ​His previous circle of good friends would always do this. They would
make each other pass out. And they actually would tape it ‘cause it was the
90s [laughs].
Jenny:​ Jesus.
Kristin:​ So everyone had a fucking camcorder. So they would tape it, that
was part of it. And it wasn’t – saying it now, it sounds like it was sexual. It
wasn’t at all.


Jenny: ​Right, right.
Kristin: ​It was just like – you know, you don’t have access to drugs so
here’s another fun, insane thing you should ​never ​do!
Jenny: ​[laughing nervously] Don’t do that.
Kristin: ​Please don’t do that.
Jenny: ​No, no, no.
Kristin: ​No, I never did that.
Jenny: ​Me neither.
Kristin: ​But I did know people who did.
Jenny: ​Same.
Kristin: ​So be like Jenny and Kristin. Don’t make yourself pass out, for god’s
sake. There’s plenty of other things to do in this world.
Jenny: ​So Giles is pretty stressed out because he doesn’t know how to get
rid of Eyghon without killing Jenny.
Kristin: ​Yes.
Jenny: ​And Buffy is like “I’ve got the guys working on it.”
Kristin: ​Ugh. Yeah, and this is just another underline in this role reversal
that we talked about, where Giles is a mess. Giles is a hot mess this whole
episode for so many reasons and has kept a secret, has tried to push Buffy
away. It’s all the things Buffy has done to Giles so many times.
Jenny: ​Mmhmm.


Kristin: ​And then something I skipped over that of course we’re going to
come back to is Buffy and Ethan again. And they’re planting more seeds for
their spinoff show.
Jenny: ​Right.
Kristin: ​Ethan has this comment to Buffy where she’s like, “I’m not gonna
run, I’m gonna fight this thing” and Ethan’s like, “aren’t we manly?” And
then Buffy says, “well, one of us is.” Which is a zing! ‘Cause Buffy’s on my
page, Buffy’s trying to be like, “I know you have a crush on Giles.” But in the
90s, the way she said that was by saying “you’re not manly” which is rude,
Buffy.
Jenny: ​Really? I thought she was just saying –
Kristin:​ [quietly] No, she wasn’t.
Jenny:​ One of us is manly ‘cause I’m gonna fight this thing and you’re just
trying to run away.
Kristin: ​No, she was. I just want to lay everything into my own narrative.
Jenny: ​Wow, wow! Wow, Kristin.
Kristin: ​This episode is just Kristin writing fanfiction live on the podcast.
[they both laugh] And in my fanfiction, Buffy is homophobic.
Jenny: ​No!
Kristin: ​No, no, no. She’s not, she’s not.
Jenny: ​It’s fine.
Kristin: ​It’s fine. Everything’s fine.
Jenny: ​So what I don’t buy is Buffy’s spidey sense not going off when
Ethan’s like, “after you.”


Kristin: ​Yeah, same. She – Buffy trusts Ethan a little too much, a little too
quickly.
Jenny: ​Yeah, that was a little too convenient.
Kristin: ​But also I think there might be something emotionally going on for
her, because Giles has really shut the door, literally and figuratively, on their
relationship and she knows that Ethan and Giles were friends.
Jenny: ​Awww.
Kristin: ​So I think that that might play into this situation, I really do. So
Ethan gives Buffy a tattoo.
Jenny: ​Ha!
Kristin: ​[laughing] This whole thing is just bananas.
Jenny: ​Yeah, he gives her a tattoo. Meanwhile, Cordelia and Xander almost
come to blows in the library and then Sergeant Rosenberg is all like, “get in
line!”
Kristin: ​Yeah and this was in line for my second runner up for sexual
tension.
Jenny: ​Wow.
Kristin: ​This is a sexual tension moment between Xander and Cordelia.
Jenny: ​Yeah, all that hate flying around?
Kristin: ​Where Xander’s like, “I know you’re a girl, but I’m ready to throw
down” and she, like, beautifully saunters across the library. [Jenny laughs]
And she is like, “I’ve seen you fight, I can take you.” And then as you said,
Willow is like, “ahh!”
Jenny: ​How romantic.


Kristin: ​“If you keep this up, you can get out of my library” is what Willow
says. [laughs]
Jenny: ​Yeah!
Kristin: ​Then we see Giles was sleeping on the floor.
Jenny: ​Oh right, and Ethan Rayne pours acid on himself.
Kristin: ​Right.
Jenny: ​We assume that’s acid.
Kristin: ​Yeah. To remove the tattoo.
Jenny: ​Also, ow. Also another question. If you pour acid on yourself, does it
really get rid of a tattoo?
Kristin: ​Ooh.
Jenny: ​Wait, I didn’t just ask that. Don’t do any research.
Kristin: ​That’s probably a horrible thing to Google.
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​Do you know that I learned this week that ​Buffy the Vampire Slayer
was the first television series to ever use the phrase “I Googled it”?
Jenny: ​You know what’s weird, you said you learned that today?
Kristin: ​Mmhmm.
Jenny: ​‘Cause I feel like about a month ago, we had the same conversation
where you were like, “do you know what I learned today?”
Kristin: ​No!
Jenny: ​[skeptical] Mmmm…


Kristin: ​Somebody tweeted at me yesterday.
Jenny: ​[skeptical] Mmm, but you know how sometimes you learn things –
[laughs]
Kristin: ​Did I say it on the podcast? Is there evidence?
Jenny: ​I put the question to our lovely audience.
Kristin: ​Okay, they’ll let me know if I’m repeating myself. I am like a
goldfish, I do forget things all the time. [laughs]
Jenny: ​[laughing] You are. So what do you think in these Giles dreams is
the person with the Bono glasses who’s like, “time to sleep.” Do you think
that’s Giles, do you think that’s Ethan, do you think that’s Phillip Henry, do
you think that’s that other guy whose name got crossed off?
Kristin: ​I think it’s the other guy – yeah, I didn’t identify that rose-colored
glasses person to be any of them. I was very confused about the dreams.
The dreams were weird to me. I didn’t feel the dreams had a necessary –
like, I didn’t feel that they had a purpose in the arc?
Jenny: ​I feel like they developed over the three times that we saw them
and they gave us a window into something that we didn’t have a full handle
on before – you know, it sort of seeded information each time.
Kristin: ​Yeah, I guess I just would have just preferred a flashback, you
know what I mean? I would loved to see young Giles, who by the way, we
get to see in that picture.
Jenny: ​Oh my god.
Kristin: ​Tiny Giles. But I would have loved to see them interacting more? I
just didn’t get very much from the dream sequences except for like, oh,
things are spooky. But they were – it seemed like we were supposed to
gather that Giles was learning things from the dreams, ‘cause he had a
dream and he realized Buffy was in – you know? I don’t know, I was
confused.


Jenny: ​Really? No, the last one? I feel like he just – she told him to stay put
‘cause he was all fucked up and then he woke up.
Kristin: ​And was concerned about her, just period?
Jenny: ​Yeah and more mobile than when he had passed out.
Kristin: ​Okay and knew that his boyfriend would be back at his costume
shop?
Jenny: ​Oh yeah.
Kristin: ​Great. So Willow has a –
Jenny: ​The best idea.
Kristin: ​The most incredible idea. She’s like, “Angel’s dead and Angel has a
demon inside of him that’s probably stronger than Eyghon” which that’s
kinda take – [through gritted teeth] by the way, kind of took a risk there
guys.
Jenny: ​Yeah, that could have ended badly.
Kristin: ​Could have ended really badly. But yeah, we go to the costume
shop and there’s another fight scene. [laughs]
Jenny: ​Most of it internal.
Kristin: ​Angel grabs Jenny by the throat and Giles has a moment of panic,
he’s gonna kill her, Willow says, “trust me” and then… [laughing]
Jenny: ​And then Eyghon enters Angel’s body and we see a wonderful
wibble-wobble effect come over his face.
Kristin: ​It’s such – it’s the same wibble-wobble that we saw in the
Master’s…
Jenny: ​Oh yeah!


Kristin: ​It’s the same filter. They were just like, eh, just put that wibble
wobble bubble. Just put that over Angel’s face. [laughing]
Jenny: ​And internally, Angel triumphs and then falls down.
Kristin: ​Yeah. Jenny and Giles walk out and we think, okay, well, they’re
gonna be still in love.
Jenny: ​But no because PTS Jenny.
Kristin: ​Yeah, because she’s so traumatized. I mean, she was possessed for
quite some time.
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​She’s exhausted and she doesn’t want Giles to touch her. It’s really
sad. I have –
Jenny: ​Yeah, she looks like she has not been sleeping. Wow, Kristin drew
Jenny and Giles and then a broken heart in the middle.
Kristin: ​In between. I was really sad for them. Right above that, I wrote:
“nice neckerchief, Buffy.”
Jenny: ​Ha!
Kristin: ​Buffy’s rocking a neckerchief, once again.
Jenny: ​To hide that tattoo.
Kristin: ​And then Buffy and Giles, right? At the end here, they have this
conversation.
Jenny: ​So beautiful.
Kristin: ​Jenny, you can talk about it. I know it really got you.


Jenny: ​It’s just like, this reversal, and Buffy’s all like, “you should forgive
yourself regardless of whether Jenny forgives you or not.” And then she’s
like, “hey, check it out, you were a short-sighted idiot. Guess we have
something in common after all.”
Kristin: ​Awww.
Jenny: ​Which is nice.
Kristin: ​Such a good moment. They have certainly – they’ve bonded way
more than Joyce and Buffy have bonded at this point.
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​Right, they’re like –
Jenny: ​Where is Joyce? Ugh, she’s at the gallery, I guess.
Kristin: ​Joyce is so busy.
Jenny: ​Uh, she’s got an opening coming up this weekend.
Kristin: ​She has so much to do. She’s probably going on a date, you know?
Jenny: ​[skeptically] I don’t know.
Kristin: ​No, just working. Just working hard for her money.
Jenny: ​Yeah, she is a busy lady.
Kristin: ​She is, she’s very busy. And then we learn that Giles does like
music, he just prefers music by the Bay City Rollers.
Jenny: ​Wow. Which – yeah.
Kristin: ​We’ll see what happens but I think we’re gonna take a little
inspiration from that fact for our song this week.
Jenny: ​We’re gonna try.


Kristin:​ We’re gonna try, we’ll see how we do.
Jenny: ​Also, “I think we’re supposed to be training right now,” Buffy says as
the completely full high school is walked through by many, many students
on their way to and from class. Implying that Buffy doesn’t just train in the
library after hours, as she was in the beginning of the episode, but she also
just does it in the middle of school.
Kristin: ​In her free periods, probably.
Jenny: ​Because as we know, no one ever goes to the library at Sunnydale
High School.
Kristin:​ No, no one. No one ever.
Jenny: ​For any reason.
Kristin: ​No. They don’t need books. They got... they don’t have anything. I
was gonna say they’ve got cell phones. They don’t. They don’t have
anything. They – they’re just good. They’re good. Maybe they brought
crossword puzzles with them or something.
Jenny: ​Oooh. Yeah yeah yeah.
Kristin: ​[laughs] Anyhow, great episode.
Jenny: ​Loved it.
Kristin: ​So exciting to get to talk to Stuart.
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​Um, yeah. And I think that does it for this week.
Jenny: ​Yeah, thanks so much for listening.
Kristin: ​Mmhmm.

Jenny and Kristin: ​Awooooooooooooo!
[Jenny performing “The Dark Age” off of the album “Songs from Season
Two” by Buffering the Vampire Slayer]
Never knew that you got into
Passing out for demon rituals
When you were closer to my age
Now these youthful indiscretions
Surfacing in fearful remnants
Making all your old friends turn into...
Blue goo
That’s how the demon spreads
Blue goo
If you’re unconscious or dead
Blue goo
Stay away from that blue goo
Ethan Rayne seems like the kind of
Nemesis who’s a backbiter
Can’t believe you used to be good friends
Jenny Calendar, you love her


Which is gross cause you’re adults but
No one wanted her to fall into...
Blue goo
That’s how the demon spreads
Blue goo
If you’re unconscious or dead
Blue goo
Stay away from that blue goo
My pals are really smart
And also my boyfriend
Is in possession of a useful demon
You said to go away
That you would handle it
Lucky for you I’m no good at listening
And it turns out we got
An actual awful lot
Of stuff in common and we need each other, Giles
Blue goo
Was how the demon spread
Blue goo
But now that demon is dead
Blue goo
We saved the whole world from blue goo
Except Phillip and Diedre
Kristin: ​So we recorded this episode on Tuesday, but it goes up on
Wednesday. And this Wednesday is March 8th, International Women’s Day
and also A Day Without a Woman. A day when many women are taking the
day off of work, staying home from work to make a statement about what
this world would be like without a woman. However, many women also can’t
do that. Many women have to go to work and many of them are going to be
wearing red.
So we just wanted to say that we stand in solidarity with all of you
participating. And I just want to close with a tweet from an activist that we
follow, Brittany Packnett, because I think it really sums up what today is


about. She says: “I’m hoping tomorrow is not a day where we judge women
for their choice to not work or their need to. This is a day of empowerment.
Whether you see a woman not working or a woman wearing red or a woman
doing neither, think about what we go through to need this day at all.”
