#Buffering the Vampire Slayer
Episode 7.18: Dirty Girls
[CHIME]
Jenny:
Oh, hello, everybody!
Kristin:
Wow. Are you ready to just dive into an audience
that is ready to party so
hard in Chicago, Illinois?
Jenny:
This audience. [Kristin laughs] So lively.
Potentially so full of malort.
Kristin:
[laughs] We recorded this episode that you’re
about to hear from Lincoln
Hall in Chicago, just a little over a week—mm, and a half—two—I don’t know what
time is. But—
Jenny:
What is time?
Kristin:
You know. And we have some fantastic special
guests, including but not
limited to—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Mmhmm!
Kristin:
Rosemary Maybe, who is—
Jenny:
Woo!
Kristin:
Many things, but in this universe, is one
of our incredible Facebook mods
and hails from Chicago. Jess Abbott, I’m not sure who she is, Jenny. Do you know
who Jess Abbott is?
Jenny:
That’s my wife.
Kristin:
[laughs] You’ll hear Jenny refer to Jess
as her current wife many times in
this episode. [Jenny laughs] And we also have a little treat from Morgan Lutich, one
of our nemesis-es that was sent in via video that we played in Chicago. One thing
that you don’t hear that’s important to the throughline of the episode is that at the
start, before Jenny said hello and we were just doing our live show banter, Jenny
said that she thought that she was my best friend. [Jenny laughs] But I was not her
best fri—I thought I was her best friend. [Jenny laughs] And she was my best
friend. But actually—so you’ll hear me ribbing—
Jenny:
But actually, I’m Kristin’s best friend and she’s my good friend.
Kristin:
Right, right. [laughs] So you’ll hear me
ribbing Jenny for that throughout,
but you don’t get the origin point. So now you know that Jenny’s a jerk. Off—[Jenny
laughs] both when recording a podcast and not, you know?
Jenny:
How dare! How dare!
Kristin:
Okay, a couple of orders of business, yes?
We have some Dirty Girls
merchandise, that’s related to the episode Dirty Girls. We have some Bad Girls
candles. Yes. Labeled, designed by Isabella Rotman, featuring a back-to-back Buffy
and Faith. They are handcuffed to each other, in fact. They’re so bad.
Jenny:
Oops.
Kristin:
They’re so bad.
Jenny:
They’re so bad, they had to be handcuffed to
each other. [both laugh]
Kristin:
The candle was made by hand, the candles
are made by hand. We have a
candle maker, that’s right, who hails from Chicago, so that’s fun.
Jenny:
[laughs] Indeed!
Kristin:
And they are gorgeous. They have some, like,
pomegranate and thyme as
their toppings. They smell delicious, they are beautiful and there are only, like, a
handful of them left because we sold a whole bunch of them in Chicago proper
before they went into the online store.
Jenny:
And while you’re in there, let me also inform
you—I’m here to educate, I’m
here to entertain. I’m here to deliver the good news of a fresh reprint of the
Kristin’s erotic novel scene. [laughs] From Season 3. And this edition is so beautiful.
You may recall Kristin plucking what she terms erotic novels, but are more like
sentences. [both laugh]
Kristin:
From the script. Already written. [laughs]
Jenny:
From the script of episodes in Season 3, where
hot things happen between
Faith and Buffy. This new printing is five by five inches, [laughs] you’re welcome.
Kristin:
That’s right.
Jenny:
There is a page at the front that probably has a specific name that Kristin
might know—
Kristin:
Vellum?
Jenny:
A vellum page that’s sort of, like, translucent
and then it has, like, some
very cool artwork on it. It looks extraordinary. Then you have you beautiful
illustrations and erotic novel text, and! [laughing] Bespoke blood spatter [Kristin
laughs] all throughout. They look…so extraordinary. They were printed over at
Delicious Designs in—also in Chicago. Just got some homebrew Fuffy merch up in
here.
Kristin:
Yes, the zines are gorgeous and they not
only were printed by Delicious
Design, they were redesigned. So it’s the illustrations by Kristine Tuna and then a
redesign of the layout and all of that by Delicious Design. Also, Jenny and I
painstakingly hand numbered each zine, a limited edition of 314, and we signed
them all. So they are signed, they are hand numbered, they are stunning. Jenny
took 69 out of 300 number—she has number 69 out of 300. Do you know what
number I took?
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Yes. [gasps] What number did
you take? One.
Kristin:
Fifty-five, baby! Five by five!
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Why?
Kristin:
Five by five!
Jenny:
Ohhh! Boy. Jeez. Yeah, that’s good.
Kristin:
Yeah. But yeah. Get ‘em while you can, ‘cause
once they’re gone, that’s it.
That’s what happens when you hand number shit.
Jenny:
Mmhmm.
Kristin:
Just a very quick shout to the fact that
on Patreon, we are rolling on
through our Yellowjackets podcast, Doomcoming. We’re doing our last live watch of
the last two episodes on August 11th in the Discord. LaToya and I also just
rounding out our First Kill podcast, and we’ll be finishing that up in the next couple
of weeks. And hey, speaking of First Kill, which is based on a short story by V.E.
Schwab, we are reading V.E. Schwab’s The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue for this
month’s book club. We meet a week from this Saturday to talk about that book, so
if you wanna scoot on in there and join us, it is so good so far! [Jenny laughs] I’m
only, like, 30 pages in and I’m like, oh, this is gonna be an easy ready ‘cause I
cannot put it down.
Jenny:
Speaking of not being able to put things down.
[Kristin laughs] And also
picking things up. Hey, let me tell you the results of last episode’s Sexual Tension
Awards, if you don’t mind. [takes deep breath] The people have spoken about our
noms and slots for Lies My Parents Told Me, and they said fourth place, 4% of the
vote, Xander and chains. The people said “no thank you” to Xander and chains.
[both laugh] Giles has been a bad boy, a bad daddy lately, so this makes sense.
He’s in third place, just barely ahead of Xander and chains, with 10% of the vote,
Giles and books.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
Mm! Mm! Now, normally I think we’d see second
place in hotter competition
with first place, but Dru, daffodils and viscera could only garner 26% of the vote.
And do you know why, Kristin?
Kristin:
It has something to do with some bells over
in Los Angeles, as far as I
know.
Jenny:
Mmm. Some good bells. [Kristin laughs] In first
place—Fred, sight unseen
on Buffy the Vampire Slayer proper. In first place, with 60% of the vote, you thirsty
homos, it’s Willow and Fred.
Kristin:
Congratulations to all of us. This is a win
for nemesis-es—
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
As well as witches and people who have been
living in hell dimensions for
many years. You know? Just—
Jenny:
A victory for everyone.
Kristin:
It’s true. A quick email before we scoot
on into this rowdy episode.
Jenny:
Mmm!
Kristin:
This is about Dirty Girls and it came in
after the live taping, so I thought it
would be fun to scoot it on into the beginning of the episode so it makes it in
context. Roser—I’m not sure if I’m saying your name right—wrote in to say,
“Preparing for Dirty Girls, I noticed that Buffy tells Faith that her house might be a
new house, since everything has been broken and replaced. [Jenny laughs] This has
to do with the thought experiment of Theseus’ ship. It is said that those who say
after replacing every component of a thing, that this thing ceases to be its old self
and become a new one, do not believe in the essence of a thing or a soul of the
thing.” Right? Like, if you say that if you take each piece of this ship—that was the
Theseus’ ship conversation. If you take every piece of that ship and replace it with
something new, and no old piece of that ship remains, is it a new ship? And so if
you believe—
Jenny:
Mm.
Kristin:
That it is a new ship, it is said that you
don’t believe that a thing has an
essence or a soul. And so, this listener says, “It’s interesting that it’s actually Buffy
‘he has a soul now’ who says [both laugh] that this house is actually a brand new
house.” So I thought that was a fun little—
Jenny:
Wow.
Kristin:
Little thing to put at the top.
Jenny:
Incredible. I love this. I love this! You know,
the human body actually—
Kristin:
Mm.
Jenny:
Replaces itself entirely every seven years
or so. You—every cell is gone
from seven years ago.
Kristin:
See? So if you don’t—if you don’t believe
that we have an essence or a
soul, then that means we’re just entirely different people every seven—even your
brain cells? Everything? Every cell?
Jenny:
Apparently. Every cell.
Kristin:
Wow. Well, Jenny and I will be thinking deep
thoughts about that—
Jenny:
Yeah. [laughs]
Kristin:
While you listen to us holler and hoot to
an audience in Chicago about girls
and how dirty they are.
Jenny:
[gasps] So dirty. [Kristin laughs]
[Buffering theme plays]
[cheering and applause]
Jenny:
Hello! And welcome to Buffering the Vampire
Slayer, a podcast where we’re
watching and discussing every episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, one by one,
spoiler free, in tandem with the gals I’d love to bum a cigarette off in the Summers
basement, strategically near some recently reinstalled manacles. [cheering] Angel
on Top! I am Jenny Owen Youngs! [cheering] Thank you!
Kristin:
Things have really progressed between you
and the girls at Angel on Top.
[laughs]
Jenny:
Leave us alone! [laughter] You have your corner.
[laughter] And we have
our cot and manacles. Let it happen. [laughter]
Kristin:
I am Kristin Russo, and this week we’re talking
about Season 7, Episode
18, Dirty, dirty,
dirty
Girls! [cheering and applause]
Stay tuned at the end of this
podcast every other week for an original song, written by Jenny Owen
Youngs—though this week, cowritten by Jess Abbott. [cheering] Recapping the
episode that we are discussing.
Jenny:
Dirty Girls was written and directed by nary
a girl, dirty or otherwise.
[laughter]
Kristin:
They were busy in the shower, getting clean!
Jenny:
Okay!
Kristin:
Together!
Jenny:
Yeah, that’s definitely what girls in a shower
together do. They get clean.
[laughter] This episode was written by Drew Goddard and directed by Michael
Gershman, and it originally aired on April 15th, 2003.
Kristin:
[laughs] Jenny and I have been doing a little
side Yellowjackets podcast
that aired, like, two seconds ago. And it’s just so funny. We’re like, this aired four
days ago.
Jenny:
The other day. [laughter]
Kristin:
According to IMDB, this is the one where Faith—have you heard of her?
[cheering] “She returns to Sunnydale just as a new villain, Caleb”—womp-womp—
[laughter] arrives—[laughs] yes, Chicago! “And sends Buffy a message in the form
of a badly beaten Potential. Buffy leads the rest of the girls to Caleb and the First’s
lair with devastating consequences.” We thought we’d do a fun one with you guys
live. [laughter]
Jenny:
Yeah, Kristin didn’t even read the episode
description when we scheduled
this live taping. She was just like, “Faith’s back, it’s called Dirty Girls.”
Kristin:
I was like, Dirty Girls, yeah! Then I watched
the episode and was like, oh
my, interesting, okay. Okay. [laughter] More happens here than just Buffy and Faith
kissing, okay.
Jenny:
Uh…so previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer,
for those of you who are just
joining us. Faith-Faith-Faith-Faith-Faith-Faith-Faith-Faith-Faith, Faith, Faith.
Kristin:
I—my favorite part of the Faith-Faith-Faith-Faith-Faith
previously ons is
that they cut—intercut Giles being like, “She’s unstable, Buffy,” with Buffy then
stabbing Faith in the stomach. [laughter]
Jenny:
Yes, and? [crosstalk]
Kristin:
[laughs] Just maybe examine this, okay.
Jenny:
What else happened previously? Oh, Jenny Calendar
was the original
apparition of the First that we saw. Is Angel a righteous man? It’s not in the
previously’s, but it always bears repeating. Don’t forget that the First is
noncorporeal and can only appear as people that are dead, for some reason. Also—
Kristin:
Or your favorite CGI demon, which is also
in the previously on’s.
Jenny:
[laughs] Or your fa—and the TV zap. Mm, Potential
Slayers are a thing, the
First wants to kill them and all the Watchers, and then Faith, and then Buffy. At
least, the hierarchy in Buffy’s mind. She’s like, “This is the order it’ll definitely
happen because I am the top of the pyramid.” [laughter] Spike has a soul now,
don’t forget.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
Giles, please! Oh, Willow got a call from Fred
in LA.
Kristin:
Mmhmm. [cheering] Give us the footage of the car ride, I demand it. I
wanna know.
Jenny:
The squirming discomfort.
Kristin:
Or!
Jenny:
The running at the mouth.
Kristin:
Or!
Jenny:
Which car ride are you talking about?
Kristin:
The car ride between Faith and Willow.
Jenny:
Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about.
Kristin:
So maybe they—[stutters]
Jenny:
Oh, you want them to do a little smooch?
Kristin:
I want
everyone
to do a little smooch! [laughter
and cheers]
Jenny:
No, the car ride is where Willow can’t stop
talking about Fred—like,
processing in real time.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Ohhh. Alright. Okay, fine.
But maybe just a little smooch.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] And Faith would give her some
very direct, like, shooting
from the hip kind of, like…straightforward feedback. If they could have a—
Kristin:
So what do you think that—
Jenny:
And then do a little smooch, maybe. [laughter]
Kristin:
Thank you.
Jenny:
Okay.
Kristin:
What do you think Faith would tell Willow
in that car ride to do? She
has—she’s dating Kennedy, but she, you know, just got very, very forwardly asked
out, kind of, by Fred.
Jenny:
Faith has enormous YOLO energy. [laughter]
Faith would be like, “Why
choose? Do it all.” [cheering]
Kristin:
Did you have “YOLO” on your bingo card for
tonight? [laughter] Just
realized I should open up a really important folder here, it’s just gonna take me a
second.
[FAITH jingle plays]
She's from Boston, keeps it Spartan, doesn't need any frills
Seems like she's the only one who's taking care of herself
Don't call her loser, she's a bruiser with the power and skill
But the demons deep inside her are the hardest to kill
Faith!
Jenny:
Just like Faith. [cheering and applause]
Kristin:
[laughs] It was like Faith’s jingle driving
in a car with Willow, you know?
Jenny:
Yes. [laughter]
Kristin:
Alright.
Jenny:
The other things you should know, just two
more things from the
previously.
Kristin:
Oh. Yes.
Jenny:
I just want everyone to be totally up to date,
because I know there are
some people who have never watched Buffy. [laughter] What?! [laughter]
Kristin:
Just like, so close to my face.
Jenny:
Giles did a plot with Robin! Where they tried
to kill Spike and hid it from
Buffy, ahhh! And Buffy’s like, “Fuck you, Dad.” Okay. [laughter]
Kristin:
Buffy is as cold as fucking ice, later in
this episode. [something clicks] Oh!
Wow.
Jenny:
What?!
Kristin:
That was just so—I just like a good sound
effect and it was good.
Jenny:
Okay. [laughs]
Kristin:
Yeah, so, whatever. Buffy is as cold as ice
to Giles, and we support it.
Although in this episode, she, like, proves somehow Giles’ point—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Yeah, she maybe is—yeah.
Kristin:
By making a—whatever. We’ll get into it.
It’s actually literally why we’re
here. [laughter] So we begin in the woods. Oh, no. I don’t wanna begin here, but
that’s what the episode is doing. Shannon, a Potential, is running away from the
Bringers. Oh, lucky for her, Nathan Fillion, hot off of the set of Firefly, [laughter] is
cruising in his really—I mean, you can say—
Jenny:
Very cool truck.
Kristin:
Say what you will about Caleb, the truck
is good. [laughter] Evil knows a
good truck, okay? Shannon gets into the car and is like, “Thank god you’re here.”
Caleb is like, “God? [laughs] Never heard of the guy.”
Jenny:
[laughing] “Let’s not give him credit for everything,
please.” [laughter]
Kristin:
We get our introduction to Caleb. We’re gonna
have a few things to say
about Caleb. We’re gonna have a guest or two that might have something to say
about Caleb. Jess Abbott, do you have something to say about Caleb later?
[inaudible] Great. [cheering and laughter]
Jenny:
One thing I know about Caleb is that he never
was anyone’s daddy.
[laughter and groans]
Kristin:
This is why we have the room mic installed.
[laughter] We need to catch
those responses. I’m sure—the line that gets me the most in this scene—well, I
mean, there’s so many. But the one that I bracketed in a marker backstage is “I’m
sure you just think I’m some crazy preacher man. My words would just curdle in
your ears.” Yeah.
Someone in crowd:
Why always milk? [laughter]
Jenny:
The eternal question.
Kristin:
Villains love milk! Therefore, milk is bad.
[laughter] It’s simple math,
people.
[HELLMATH jingle plays]
Hellmath!
Jenny:
He also calls the Bringers “freaky joes.” [laughter]
Has anyone here ever
used the phrase “freaky joes”?
Someone in crowd:
[inaudible] an average joe!
Kristin:
Average joe. Opposite of an average joe is
a
freaky
joe?
Jenny:
[simultaneously] [high pitched] Is it? [laughter]
Is it?
Kristin:
I don’t know.
Jenny:
Okay, I’ll take that under consideration.
Kristin:
You—[laughs] we get the title in the episode.
Jenny, you usually don’t like
that. I don’t know how you feel about it. “You know what you are? Dirty.” And a girl.
He doesn’t say that part. [laughter]
Jenny:
So we actually don’t get the title. [laughs]
Kristin:
But, like! Oh, yes.
Jenny:
Yeah, he says that she was born without a soul,
and I wonder if he says
that to all women? Or—
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
Specifically, like, Potentials and Slayers.
Many in crowd:
All women!
Jenny:
It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] All women. Caleb
hates
women—
Jenny:
So men have souls?
Kristin:
No.
Jenny:
No.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Caleb hates men too—
Jenny:
He thinks—
Kristin:
Caleb hates women more than men, but men
more than him…self.
[laughter]
Jenny:
And himself more than the First.
Kristin:
Yes. That’s the—yes. The diagram.
Jenny:
Okay.
Kristin:
Yeah, he hates women a lot. It’s bad. He
also calls Satan “a little man,”
and I would love—just, I would love, like, a little—[crosstalk]
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Reaction cam? In Hades?
Kristin:
Yeah. I just want a little picture in picture
of just, like, what Satan is doing
at that moment.
Jenny:
“The fuck?” [laughter]
Kristin:
Having a fucking good time down here.
Jenny:
Uh-huh.
Kristin:
Using a car lighter, very to the—you know.
What does Caleb do now?
Jenny:
It’s…I think…sorry, this is not an answer to
your question. [laughter] I think
it’s—
Kristin:
Did anyone think it was? [laughter]
Jenny:
I think it’s really interesting that instead
of just using the car lighter, he
goes—he adds, like, a laborious extra step for a man who’s driving and
monologuing. [laughter] You know? He waits until the lighter is done baking, and
then he puts it on his little ring, and you think it’s gonna be—like, when we see the
burn later, you think it’s gonna be like, “Caleb” or like—[laughter] “boys rule, girls
drool” or whatever. But it’s just a circle! Why not just use the lighter? You know?
[laughter] Thank you.
Kristin:
“Caleb.” Imagine it just said “Caleb.” [laughter]
Jenny:
Big C!
Kristin:
None of this is funny, but like, we’re reaching
for whatever we can here,
okay? You mentioned that Buffy thinks that she is the shit. But I hate to break it to
you, so does Caleb. Caleb literally says—
Jenny:
But Caleb is literally the villain of the piece.
[laughter]
Kristin:
True, but I’m just—
Jenny:
It looks worse on Buffy. [laughter] That’s
all.
Kristin:
Okay, fine. But I wrote in my notes, “rude,”
that he said, “Accept no
substitute Slayer.” ‘Cause I was like, I will accept the substitute.
Jenny:
Oh, oh, oh! I thought you meant, like, Caleb
thinks he’s the shit.
Kristin:
No, no! That Caleb is saying that Buffy is,
like,
the
Slayer.
Jenny:
He’s just reading
her
PR. [laughter] You know?
Kristin:
Alright. So. Caleb does a little stab. Throws
Shannon out of the truck.
Jenny:
A
little
stab?
Kristin:
A big stab. Throws Shannon out of the truck.
His—what did he do? Was he
waiting outside the Hyperion when Willow and Faith—
Jenny:
Dude! And he was like, “I’ll just get right
in front of them and I know the
way and—” [sings tune]
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Like, they pull into a Burger
King, he pulls into the Burger
King. [laughter]
Jenny:
This is—see, now if Adam had this kind of foresight
[laughter] in
Yellowjackets, then—
Kristin:
Oh, I was like, Adam?! The—
Jenny:
[laughing] Yeah, “Mommy.” [laughter]
Kristin:
So Willow and Faith get out of the car, they
find Shannon, it’s a big, like,
reveal. Faith, like, steps out of the shadows and is like—does
not
give a fuck about
Shannon, is like, yep. Guess I’m back in Sunnydale. [laughter] Credits. Oh no, more
fun.
Jenny:
Uh, [groans] okay!
Kristin:
Xander’s—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Okay, you know what?
Kristin:
He’s just…
Jenny:
Credit where credit is due. Sometimes there’s
a pillow fight, and I think we
can all appreciate [laughter] a pillow fight! And that’s good! Actually.
Kristin:
Xander is—
Jenny:
It doesn’t matter where the pillow fight
comes
from! [laughter] It’s a gift
from, like, god or whoever. You know?
Kristin:
[laughs] Xander is in his room, the door
is closed, he’s having his Xander
time. We all would imagine this is what it fucking was—
Jenny:
It’s truly none of our business.
Kristin:
It’s none of our business! [laughter] It’s
none of our business. Also, not to,
like, get too ahead of myself here, but I do—I was talking to Jenny backstage
about, like, this connective tissue between some of the moments in this episode.
Which is, like, Caleb being like, “Humans are so bad, they’re so dirty, they have
desires, they wanna touch each other, it’s gross” or whatever Caleb says. And then,
Xander has this fantasy that, you know, many of us are like, no—no, no. No—no?
No. [laughter] And then later, a scene we will talk about at length, we have Faith
talking about some fantasies as well, and Spike giving his two cents on fantasy and
desire and what have you. And so Jenny and I just talked back and forth about it
backstage, and I was like, if you don’t know exactly what the throughline is and I
don’t know exactly what the throughline is, then it’s not my fault. So we’re just
saying it out—this episode is talking about desire and fantasy in a way that is
complicated, makes us feel icky at times. But it also makes me, a gender studies
master’s degree holder, very curious to dig in deeper.
Jenny:
Oh, I’m sorry, do you need to go get your lab
coat out of the green room?
[laughter and cheers]
Kristin:
Some of us don’t actually need lab coats,
Jenny.
Jenny:
Oh! [crowd reacts]
Kristin:
Sorry,
best friend
. [laughter] Okay. Oh,
great, we go to the hospital, a
cheery place, always.
Jenny:
Faith has a great point, that we’ve been banging
the drum about for a
number of episodes.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
There she was, just a phone call away, just
a quick drive away. And nobody
thought, maybe it would be a good idea to just give her a little bit of a head’s up
that the First Evil ever is attempting to end the Slayer line by wiping out every
Potential, Watcher and active Slayer. They thought she was safe in prison,
[laughter] [sarcastically] the safest place I can think of. It’s fine.
Kristin:
[sighs] That moment from Willow…
Jenny:
We haven’t seen any freaky Josephines, [laughter]
to be fair, but somehow,
they got a—
Kristin:
[laughing] “Freaky Josephines.” [laughter]
Jenny:
A friend of the—a female friend of the freaky
joes did have a big pointy
knife in prison, recently.
Kristin:
Yes. Yes. Played by the same person—
Jenny:
I mean, I know, I’m telling
you
. [laughter]
Kristin:
I know. The front row is actually very suspicious
of us tonight. [laughter]
They love us, but they feel maybe we should know more. [laughter] And that’s fair,
we should. [laughter] But we don’t, ‘cause we’re Buffering the Vampire Slayer.
[laughs]
Jenny:
Just enough to get by. [laughter]
Kristin:
So Willow is concerned because Faith wants
to go find Buffy, and she’s like,
“You’re not exactly study buddies.” And I’m like, that is literally exactly what they
are. [laughter] In code, these two are study buddies, viewer.
Jenny:
They are study buddies, they are gal pals,
they are any two words that
rhyme. [laughter] And where one is a descriptor and one is a noun. [laughter]
Okay? What?
Kristin:
I was—no, no, I was trying to think of two
words that rhyme—
Jenny:
Oh!
Kristin:
And couldn’t think of any, so. [laughter]
Into the cemetery. Okay, this is
unfair. This is unfair, this cemetery scene, right? The cemetery scene starts, and a
vampire is doing what a vampire has never done before: running
away
from a
fight? Name me one. Name me one!
Jenny:
The—this happens—
Kristin:
[to audience] Did you say Harmony? [laughter
and applause]
Jenny:
Good, yes, correct.
Kristin:
Points! Points for the audience. But this,
like, blond girl is running away
from a man in a duster. And Faith sees this and is like, clearly, this is a vampire
chasing an innocent girl—
Jenny:
Mmhmm.
Kristin:
But it’s actually a vampire with a soul chasing
a vampire without a soul.
Jenny:
Yes. It’s more complicated, but Faith doesn’t
know, so she grabs him and
throws him against a little tombstone. Big tombstone.
Kristin:
“Leather pants. Nice right cross. Doe eyes.
Holier than thou glower. You
must be Faith.” [cheering]
Jenny:
Ahh, they have a nice little chat about who reformed first and who reformed
best. [laughter] And Spike says he reformed way before she did, but I don’t think
that is actually accurate?
Many in crowd:
No!
Kristin:
[laughs] Chicago!
Jenny:
[simultaneously] That is extremely incorrect.
Kristin:
Chicago was like, yeah, you went to Philly?
We’ll show you! [laughter] We
can be louder than Philly! [cheers]
Jenny:
In the middle of this, Buffy shows up and punches
Faith and Faith says,
“Luckily, you still punch like you used to.” [cheers] Good, yes, good. Punch each
other. [laughter]
Kristin:
Faith is like, immediately having an identity
crisis. Wait, so, hold on. I
understand that this show is written so that I’m supposed to be the bad Slayer and
you’re the good Slayer—are you the bad Slayer? Does that make me the good
Slayer? What the fuck is happening? [laughter] It’s really good. I don’t even know
where to go in this scene, because there’s so many things I’m excited about. One
is, of course, the fact that Faith takes the stake from the side of Buffy’s pants.
Jenny:
Is it in…a cargo pocket?
Kristin:
[flustered sounds]
Jenny:
What is the enclosing…fix—what is it?
Kristin:
I don’t care. [laughter and applause]
Jenny:
Okay.
Kristin:
[to audience] What? Metaphytics! Aww, metaphytics.
Jenny:
I love it, it’s probably metaphytics. It’s
probably not a cargo pocket.
[laughter]
Kristin:
No, it’s definitely—it feels like—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] That would be—
Kristin:
Because the only other option would be the
carpenter jean hook, and
there’s nothing to hook the stake on.
Jenny:
Well, no, no, no, because carpenter pants have
both a hammer hook and a
ruler pocket.
Kristin:
Ohh, maybe it’s—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Which actually would be a
really good place…
Kristin:
That—okay.
Jenny:
Depending on where it—how long the stake is
and how deep the pocket
goes and where that comes against your knee? Just for mobility?
Someone in crowd:
Thigh holster!
Kristin:
What?
Someone in crowd:
Thigh holster!
Kristin:
But—you think Buffy’s just casually wearing
a thigh holster? [laughter]
Jenny:
Okay.
Kristin:
I’m so sorry—listeners, we’re actually going
to give the microphones to the
audience. They…[laughter]
Jenny:
Yes, we’re gonna need 250 microphones, please.
[laughter]
Kristin:
Regardless of where the fuck the stake is,
Faith reaches and grabs it and
then kills a vampire, and I am turned on. [cheers]
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Would you say perhaps that
she first wants? Then she
takes?
Kristin:
[simultaneously] [to crowd] Thank you. Jenny
wants to talk over it. She
doesn’t wanna hear about it.
Jenny:
Then she
has
the stake.
Kristin:
Yes.
[cheers and applause]
Jenny:
Yes, I for—for the first time ever, I spoke
over
you
. [laughter] And that was
shocking for Kristin.
Kristin:
I’m not insulted by that. That’s just the
truth. [laughter] Jenny interrupted
me and said sorry yesterday, and I was like, you’ve got a, like, big stack of, like,
Kohl’s cash. But instead of Kohl’s cash, it’s like, interrupting me cash. [laughter] So
you’re good. The other—my other favorite part is that Faith is like, “Oh, so you’re
like Angel?” to Spike. [laughter] And for the rest of the scene—the whole scene is
happening, and Spike is only thinking about this. [laughter] I’m not—I’m not—at
the end, he’s like, “Angel’s dull as a table lamp and we have very different coloring.”
[laughter] So mad!
Jenny:
I like any time Spike is thinking about Angel,
and any time Angel is thinking
about Buffy and wondering what she thinks about him.
Kristin:
Yeah. We have a video for that later. [cheers]
Oh my god, thank god,
finally, we’re at Revello Drive, not like a hospital or an evil preacher’s truck.
Jenny:
Or Xander’s…situation. [laughter]
Kristin:
You know, we do hard work up here. So, we
go to Revello—[audience
laughs]
Jenny:
Hello. [laughter] Phrasing. So at Revello Drive.
[laughter]
Kristin:
At Revello Drive, Faith shows up and is like,
“Hey, this time, do you have
any room for me?” [crowd reacts]
Jenny:
And they’re like, “Well, we didn’t have any
room for you before when three
people lived here, but now that 72 people live here, [laughter] we can find
somewhere for you to squeeze in.”
Kristin:
But they’re so fucking shitty about it! This
girl turned herself in to fucking
prison. Just, fuck everyone is the long and—I don’t even need to—I’m not even
gonna waste your time. It’s just like—they’re just really rude, and she bats it back.
But the thing that I love about this is that Faith sees Dawn and is like, “Brat’s all
woman-sized now.” And we’re like, wait. The monks gave Faith Dawn memories
and—
Jenny:
Whole package. Whole life package.
Kristin:
Just like, the monks deserve a raise. [laughter
and cheers]
Jenny:
Haven’t they all been destroyed?
Kristin:
Well, wherever they are now.
Jenny:
Wherever they are. Okay.
Kristin:
To—you know. Pour one out for the monks.
[laughter]
Jenny:
Salut.
Kristin:
That’s some high quality IT work, you know?
[laughter] Anyway, they
squeeze Faith in for the night. Which, I could make several other jokes about.
[laughter] But Spike and Faith—
Jenny:
Spike is like, well, actually, previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
[laughter]—Giles—he literally says, “Giles was part of a plan to kill me for Buffy’s
own good,” which feels [Kristin laughs] like maybe the most exposition-est thing
I’ve ever heard on this show. [laughter]
Kristin:
But it’s Spike and Faith talking to each
other, so I’m fine with it.
Jenny:
Yeah, so it’s fine.
Kristin:
Yeah, and Spike is basically like, “Not all
of that tension that you just saw
is about you.” You know? And Faith is like, “okay, well, it makes me feel a little bit
better about me, a little bit worse about Giles and, hmm, kinda shaky about you.”
Love—and these two tell—these two tell the truth. I was like, these two tell the
truth. [laughter] For the listeners at home and all the people on the balcony who
couldn’t see me, I made a scissoring motion with my fingers.
Jenny:
Yeah, Spike and Faith, always scissoring. Never
not scissoring. [laughter
and applause]
Kristin:
Don’t yuck my yum, Jenny!
Jenny:
[laughing] Okay.
Kristin:
Oh, goody, the vineyard.
[crowd groans]
Jenny:
The
evil
vineyard! Do you like it any better
when it’s
evil
? [laughter]
Kristin:
Do you think the wine is good at the vineyard?
Jenny:
Noo! They’re in California. No offense to California.
[crowd reacts]
Kristin:
Oh no, I just—I literally got so scared for
the future. Because we’re in
Chicago, so we’re, like, mostly safe?
Jenny:
[simultaneously] We’re among friends here.
They’re like, malort! [laughter
and cheers]
Kristin:
I got nervous.
Jenny:
I just—sorry.
Kristin:
It looks like fruit punch, so—
Jenny:
It doesn’t look great.
Kristin:
It doesn’t.
Jenny:
But also…wine is red, or whatever. [laughter]
As I always say. [laughter]
No, I’m just—I’m sweating, I’m scared about what people from California will do to
me in the future.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Oh! I was like, take your
jacket off. Okay.
Jenny:
Our many…
Kristin:
I agree. Cali—there is some good California
wine, but most of it—
Jenny:
Totally! But there’s so much of it—
Kristin:
Yes.
Jenny:
That it can’t all be good and when you live
in California, it’s all you
can—like, it’s—you know—okay.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] This is what you came here
for, right?
Jenny:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kristin:
Did you come here to have a set of wives
and ex-wives talk about a
misogynist preacher? [crowd affirms] Is Jessica Abbott here?
[cheers and applause]
Jenny:
Jess!
[cheers and applause]
Kristin:
Hello, Jess!
Jenny:
My beautiful, current wife. [laughter and cheers]
Kristin:
I see you’ve brought some notes to the stage.
What are they written on?
Jess:
My airplane vomit bag. [laughter]
Jenny:
Very cool. Do you have a whole pad of those?
Kristin:
[laughs] That would actually be kind of a
cool idea. [laughter] They have
at least one customer. [laughter]
Jess:
I was on the plane, like, what, three days ago?
Jenny:
Sure.
Jess:
And I’ve just been carrying this around and
then I made the notes tonight on
it, so. [laughter]
Jenny:
Is that some special memories, this—?
Kristin:
Is this—so you wanted—you had thoughts about
Caleb. Is—did you write
on a waste bag as, like, symbolism?
Jess:
Symbolic, yeah. Yes, I brought this with me
when I watched the episode.
[laughter]
Kristin:
Yeah, tell us—tell us some of your thoughts, Jess.
Jess:
Well, I—so many awful, horrible tragedies happen
in this episode. And I think
that the biggest one is that it is the first time in his film career that Nathan Fillion is
not hot. [laughter]
Jenny:
How dare they? A criminal offense, objection!
Jess:
He looks like Jim Carey in Dumb and Dumber.
[laughter]
Kristin:
It’s the bangs.
Jenny:
How dare they comb this man’s hair straight
forward?
Jess:
It’s so bad—
Kristin:
They were like, we’ll just start here and
bring it all, bring it all forward. It’s
true. It’s true.
Jess:
Yeah, when you hold him up next to Mal in Firefly,
it’s like, not the same
human being at all.
Kristin:
They really wanted to make sure we didn’t
like this villain. You know?
Jess:
Yeah. And Caleb is one of my favorite villains,
starting from probably my
second or third watch through of Buffy. The first watch through, you know, he’s
like—he makes you feel so many awful, awful things. It’s—he’s just the worst, I
hate—he’s the kind of villain that you don’t even wanna watch for fun. But then I
started to really like him because I think it’s like, a fitting villain to end Buffy with.
Because it kind of, like—the lore of vampires starts with a lot of kind of, like,
Christian ideas of vampires being unholy and holy water is what kills them and so
on. And so I think it’s kind of cool that it ended up being this, like, Christian
minister type that ends up being, like, the biggest bad. That’s, like, my favorite
thing in media is when, like, they take something really average and basic and
standard and then, like, show how it can be weaponized? And I mean, that’s really
easy to do with Christianity, I think, given—[laughter] given its history. [cheers and
applause]
Jenny:
[sarcastically] Huh. I don’t know what you
mean. Christianity never did
anything wrong. [laughter]
Jess:
But I started to come around to Caleb more—not come around to him, but
like, [laughs] come around to enjoying him as a character, as a villain or whatever,
when I started to think about it more in terms of Christianity. And how he really
says things that are, like—he doesn’t say anything that sounds super crazy. He says
things that are, like, very standard Christian things to say.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jess:
It’s like, the implication he brings with it
that, like—like, the idea of calling
these girls “dirty” is the idea that no human is perfect, which I think we can all
agree upon. You know? There’s no perfect human.
Kristin:
Except for me. [laughter]
Jess:
[laughs] Except Kristin. Except my wife’s ex-wife.
[laughter]
Kristin:
Thank you.
Jess:
But it’s the—[laughter] it’s how he, like, wields
that concept that, like,
because she is not perfect, she deserves to be punished. This girl in the truck in the
beginning. And that he has the right to hand down that punishment, which is like,
when things become, you know, like, not Christian at all. [laughs] But I also think
that when it comes to Christianity, that like, Caleb is an example of what happens
when you don’t venerate Mary. [laughter] You hate women.
Kristin:
Hate women. Who the fuck is Mary? Never heard
of her.
Jess:
Yeah. I was watching—when I watched it, I was
like, this is the kind of
Christian that would—simply does not venerate Mary, [laughter] because he would
not be treating these women like this.
Kristin:
I can’t believe—did anyone ever think that
this brilliant stuff would be
written on a fucking vomit bag? [laughter] ‘Cause it really is—you picked a good
second wife.
Jenny:
Thank you! [laughter]
Jess:
Oh my god, thank you.
Kristin:
You’re welcome. [laughter] You guys wanna,
like, move in together?
Jenny:
Ahhhh! [cheers] I’m already outnumbered. [laughter]
Kristin:
Yes, though, to all of this. Yes. I could
hear the first row—mostly ‘cause
they’re closest—being like, “yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.” They’re all very excited about this.
Jess:
The only other thing I have written on this
barf bag here is…[laughter] that
Caleb strikes me as somebody that began as a criminal, and then became Christian,
as opposed to the other way around. Because he is—[laughter]
Kristin:
You hear ‘em, right? They’re into it.
Jess:
He’s too stupid to understand why there was
not the choice between red and
white wine at the last supper. [laughter] And yet was able to successfully execute
an international bombing and not get caught. [laughter] This man was definitely
trained in how to evade the law and not trained in how to interpret scripture.
[laughter]
Jenny:
Get him, Jess! [cheers]
Kristin:
Honestly. I want a whole podcast just from
you talking about Caleb.
[laughter] It’s great, right? She’s great. [cheers and applause] Jess. I mean—sorry,
do you have anything that you wanna say about Caleb, in response to what Jess
said about Caleb?
Jenny:
My wife is always right. [laughter] As I always
say.
Kristin:
Does that apply, like, retroactively?
Jenny:
Yes. It’s like being the president. You’re
always an always-right wife. No
matter—
Kristin:
Amazing!
Jenny:
The divorce status. [laughter]
Kristin:
Do you wanna high-five again?
Jess:
Oh, right, we high-five Eiffel-towered [clapping
noise] over Jenny last night
on stage. [laughter and applause]
Kristin:
I—
Jenny:
Only because I
let
them. [laughter]
Kristin:
No, I agree with all of this and I think
it’s very brilliant and I think Caleb is
terrifying. I have not yet reached my rewatch place where I still am creeped out. I
still don’t like to hear him talk. You know, Season 7 is hard, but like, see, it has
some fucking cool shit in it. Might taste like malort, but.
Jess:
You have to really—[laughter] you have to reach
for it, but—
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jess:
But it’s kind of there. [laughs] Yeah, I’d hate
to return to his awful haircut
again, but just thinking about Dumb and Dumber, like, every time I see Caleb, I
hear that line where it’s like—[laughter] some guy sees Jim Carey in that movie and
calls him a pumpkin-pie hair-cutted freak. [laughter and applause]
Kristin:
Jess. I also—you wrote a lot of the song
that is at the end of this episode.
As a matter of fact, Jenny was, like, off somewhere and she was like, “Jess just sent
me the first verse.” Like, you wrote—
Jenny:
And the entire structure and…it’s fine. Thanks,
Jess! [laughter]
Kristin:
Jess basically wrote the song. [cheers and
applause]
Jess:
Yeah, the song got finished 24 hours before
we played it yesterday. [cheers]
Jenny was very busy and—
Kristin:
Jenny and I were like, so? Jess was like,
how do you fucking work like
this?!
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Yeah, we’re like, this is
how you make a song.
Jess:
They were completely unconcerned. [laughter]
And I had been panicking for,
like, a week. [laughter]
Kristin:
Jess was like, I don’t even know how this
piece goes. And I was like, we
never know how any of the pieces go. They’re fine. [laughter] They’ll like us! Just
make a little joke. [laughter]
Jenny:
Unzip the old boob window. [cheers]
Kristin:
Oh my god, I wish it had a zipper! That would
be so fun! I would—it would
actually be very distracting ‘cause I would be constantly zipping it and unzipping it.
Jess:
It sounds like something any of the Slayers
would wear. [laughter] Any
Slayer, pick one. [laughter] Oh, okay, sorry, I had one random thought that I
wanted to say also about this episode, which is that I know that there’s a lot of
Kennedy hate, right? Is that still true?
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jess:
I don’t—I’m neutral. I have no take on it, other
than that in this episode,
when we’re watching all of the Potentials fight Caleb and those guys. The freaky
joes. [laughter] Kennedy did strike me as the one that looked the most Potential-y,
as a Slay—like, I was like, I could see her having a spinoff or something. Like, she—
Kristin:
Yeah! She fought good.
Jess:
Yeah. The camera worked for her, she seemed
like she had it together. Like,
she was acting well, the character—yeah. Anyway. I’m not saying I liked it, that was
just how it felt.
Kristin:
Yeah. Yeah. She also has a moment—she has
a moment in this episode,
Kennedy, that I love, which is when Xander is, like, about to address everyone. And
he’s like, “I need you to listen to me,” and she literally just has this one-off line
where she’s like, “We literally were.” [laughter[
Jess:
Right.
Kristin:
It’s just nice.
Jess:
Yeah.
Kristin:
It’s like, good job. Good job, Kennedy.
Jess:
Yeah. If Faith and Buffy have taught us anything,
it’s that you simply have to
have some kind of, like, salty little line to say after anyone says anything.
Kristin:
Yeah! That’s how you can tell who the next
Slayer up is.
Jenny:
Ahh! Ah-ha, ah-ha.
Kristin:
The saltiest—who’s the saltiest?
Jess:
Kennedy’s taking the most notes, for sure. [laughter]
Kristin:
Jess, I cannot tell you how lovely it was
to sit in this little line here.
Jenny:
Mmhmm!
Kristin:
For me, anyway. I don’t—Jenny, are you having
a good time?
Jenny:
Great, I’m having the best time.
Kristin:
Is there anything that you wanna talk about
together, about Jenny, while
you’re up here? [crowd reacts and cheers]
Jenny:
[firmly] Jess, it’s been so great to have you
on the podcast. [laughter]
Thank you so much for joining us and for being my beautiful wife who’s always
right. [Kristin laughs]
Jess:
Alright, well, thanks so much for having me.
[cheers and applause]
Jenny:
Jess Abbott!
[cheers and applause]
Kristin:
Hi, Jenny.
Jenny:
Hello. And welcome back to Buffering the Vampire—
Kristin:
[simultaneously] It’s fun—fun to be queer.
You know? It’s fun to be queer.
Jenny:
Mmm? Hmm.
Kristin:
Honestly, right? Isn’t it fucking—it is!
[cheers and applause]
Jenny:
Oh, come on, how would all 250 of you know?
[laughter] Okay, so, what’s
happening at the evil vineyard…is that Caleb is doing his little monologue he’s
putting together that the First is appearing to him in the guise of the—
the
Slayer,
singular, interesting. And we learn, of course, yes, that he blew up the Council
headquarters, that he is the head of the freaky joes. That he’s been sticking all the
splits, I don’t know what that means.
Kristin:
Gymnastics?
Jenny:
Ohh, okay. Doing the difficult thing well. Right? Okay. And then, he
tells—we didn’t mention about the Shannon truck business, that he was like, “I
want you to give her a message from me. Not the one behind us, the
real
one.
[laughter] The
real
Slayer.”
Someone in crowd:
Boo!
Kristin:
Booo! [crowd boo’s]
Jenny:
And in this scene, he tells the First, like,
“I know it’s going to work, because
curiosity is woman’s first sin.” [crowd boo’s]
Kristin:
I don’t know, I personally like being a dirty
girl. [cheers]
Jenny:
I have a really—the thing that I have—aside
from it being really just terrible
what they’ve done to Nathan Fillion’s hair. [laughter] The other thing about
this—this scene in particular that just, like, makes it hard for me to, like, totally buy
into him as, like, a
scary
guy—is that it’s really
hard, I think, to be scared of a man
while he’s drinking wine. [laughter] He’s like, sippin’, he’s tasting, he’s thinking
about the notes.
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Jenny:
And I just feel like it just—there’s nothing
un-tough about drinking wine. I
guess. But there’s just, like, something that’s like, not—maybe that’s it. Maybe it’s,
like, not a cinematically villainous or, like, aggressive alcohol.
Kristin:
You want, like, a good rocks glass.
Jenny:
Rocks glass or just neat, you know—
Kristin:
Yeah. Well, you can have something neat in
a rocks glass.
Jenny:
I’m…an adult, Kristin, I know. [laughter]
Kristin:
Sorry, I’m just trying to teach my best friend
a thing or two.
Jenny:
I know, and I really appreciate that. [both
laugh] But I just—you know, evil
vineyard, when you say it as a phrase, just doesn’t really strike the fear—I get the
whole blood of Christ thing. I guess. But—
Kristin:
Do you think that it is the patriarchy? [cheers] Do you? Like, I don’t wanna
misuse the jingle. But it feels like wine is, like, a woman’s thing.
Jenny:
I don’t think it’s a woman’s thing. I just
don’t think it’s a scary thing to—
Kristin:
[simultaneously] I don’t think
you
think
it’s a woman’s thing!
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Okay.
Kristin:
I’m just saying, like, a wine—it’s like,
there’s something, like, delicate
about a wine glass. It has a stem. It’s like—you know what—
Someone in crowd:
Wine mom!
Kristin:
Huh? Wine moms. Just yell—[stammers] anybody—I
just think that it—I
just think it’s maybe a patriarchal thing. That like, you know, a rocks glass is, like,
tough. Man drinks liquor.
Jenny:
Mmm.
Kristin:
Woman drinks wine. And like, I don’t think
you think that, but I think it
gets embedded in our brains and then, you know. Or…not. But I’m—
Jenny:
You should play the jingle. I’ll keep thinking
about it—I did not…fully cosign
on this jingle.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Think about it—think about
it through the jingle. Okay,
everybody think about a wine glass.
[THE PATRIARCHY jingle plays]
The patriarchy! [thunder clap, evil laughter]
Jenny:
No, I think it’s more—[laughter and applause]
Kristin:
She knows she’s funny. She fucking knows
she’s funny, you know what I
mean? Yeah, go ahead.
Jenny:
Uh. Okay. Maybe it’s about the alcohol content
of the drink, right?
Kristin:
Okay.
Jenny:
Because, like—
Kristin:
That you have to drink more wine to get drunk
then you have to drink—?
Jenny:
Yeah, and then you’re all red and, what, I’m
gonna be intimidated by you
when you’re red? [laughter] Okay. Then—
Kristin:
Okay, wait, I have one more thing—
Jenny:
Oh.
Kristin:
Are you moving scenes? Because I have one
more thing to say. I just
really—I love the—’cause after Caleb says, “Curiosity, woman’s first sin,” he says, “I
offer an apple and what can she do but take it?” which I think is, like, a very
well-written line. That’s all. I just think it’s nice. You know? It’s just, like, a nice
setup for—I see you all nodding. Yeah. Mmhmm.
Jenny:
And wouldn’t it be even cooler if it was, “I
offer her a grape. [laughter] And
what can she do but take it?” [both laugh] And then it would be all one thing.
Kristin:
Actually, the next scene, we decided to show
you—
Jenny:
[simultaneously] To show you.
Kristin:
Even though if you were here last night,
we also showed you, but it’s just
too delicious not to. So are you down for a clip?
[cheers and applause]
[Clip from episode plays]
Andrew:
Faith. Her name alone invokes awe. Faith:
a set of principles or
beliefs upon which you’re willing to devote your life. The dark Slayer. A lethal
combination of beauty, power, and death. For years and years, or to be more
accurate, months, Faith fought on the side of good, terrorizing the evil
community. But like so many tragic heroes, Faith was seduced by the lure of
the dark side. She wrapped evil around her like a large, evil Mexican serape.
She became a cold-blooded killer. Nobody was immune to her trail of
destruction, not friends, not family, not even the most pacifist and logical of
races. [fighting sounds]
Amanda:
What the hell are you talking about? I thought
Faith killed a
volcanologist.
[cheers and applause]
Kristin:
It’s just too—it’s just too good. It’s too
tasty not to play a second time.
Amanda explains to Andrew, of course, that it was a professor studying volcanoes,
not—Andrew’s like, “Uh, that doesn’t even make any sense. Why would she kill
somebody who studied Vulcans?” [laughter] It’s cute, it’s cute. Faith, meanwhile, is
in the—she’s in the backyard by herself.
Jenny:
That’s right, she’s just doing a little punch
here, a little punch there.
Punch-punch.
Kristin:
It’s nice, you know? She’s just like, I’m
gonna wake up, I’m gonna have
my morning routine, I’m gonna do my own thing. She’s not messing around with
the girls in the house. She’s just like, here to focus. I like it. I like Faith. [cheers]
There’s another language barrier joke for Chao-Ahn, in case you were missing
those. [crowd boos]
[WHITE SUPREMACY jingle plays]
You know what that sounds like to me? (What?)
White supremacy! (Oh no)
Woven in not too subtly (Ugh)
White supremacy! (Uh-uh)
Open your eyes and that's where you'll find it
Crush that (squash that)
White supremacy!
[applause]
Kristin:
Thank you, everyone, for encouraging us to
play that jingle. I looked up
the minute it started and made direct eye contact with the disco ball, [laughter] and
was just, like, so excited, you know? It really all fit together well. Yeah. Fuck the
Chao-Ahn jokes. Oh, cool, let’s go to school, shall we?
Jenny:
Robin being so good natured. What a good boy.
[laughter] Healing. Dealing.
Maybe a little too well?
Kristin:
Yeah, I mean, it’s interesting because, like,
this is the conversation that
seems to propel Buffy into making the choices that she then makes, for the rest of
the episode. And it’s like, you know, on the one hand, like, I do want her to be
listening to Robin. Because Robin has a lot of important shit to say, but also, I don’t
know that she took Robin’s advice to the proper scenario. But Robin says—I mean,
Buffy says—about the Potentials—like, “I don’t wanna do this. I don’t want to be
leading these girls into war. It can’t be the right thing.” And Robin is like, “If they
haven’t been tested in battle, then maybe the thing that they need is to be tested.”
And then he gives us this quote that calls back to the last episode. “Remember,
Buffy, the mission is what matters.” It’s a good—
Jenny:
Really trying to cement the new catchphrase,
five episodes from the series
finale. [laughter] The mission is what matters, as we have
always
said, since
Season 1.
Kristin:
We’re like, “from beneath you, it—” no, no,
no, no, no. [laughter] It’s the
mission that matters. Ugh.
Jenny:
I just think it’s, like—it’s a little—I mean.
Obviously, everyone is, like, you
know, interested in saving the world and stuff. But for a guy who, you know,
had—who had, like, been waiting his whole life to seek a particular vengeance and
then got his ass kicked.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
To hear him say, like, oh—Buffy’s like, “I
need you in this fight,” and he’s
like, “Thanks. That means a lot.” I feel like it just feels like, very—just a little
one-dimensional.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
But save the world first, blood vengeance next.
Maybe.
Kristin:
Spike, give Robin his mother’s coat back.
Jenny:
Or maybe Spike and Robin do a little smooch.
[cheers] Maybe they go to
therapy and work through some stuff, and then we can get good things.
Kristin:
Why. Not. Both? [cheers] Also, you said,
like, a bunch of things, but I
noticed some folks coming back in with drinks and one of them was wearing a boob
window. And I was like, yay! And then I was like, oh shit, Jenny’s talking. [laughter]
So. I’m so sorry.
Jenny:
Cool. [laughs]
Kristin:
Just like, great job! Boob window solidarity!
[laughter and cheers]
Speaking of boobs.
Jenny:
Yes. Go on.
Kristin:
We are about to go to the basement. [cheers]
[singsong] “Does anybody
have a cigarette for me? [cheers] I wanna smoke a cigarette!” [laughter]
Jenny:
Uh-huh? Uh-huh?
Kristin:
Faith goes to the basement to smoke a cigarette.
And—
Jenny:
But Spike’s all down there, shirtless already.
[cheers]
Kristin:
Be-sheeted, as Jenny Owen Youngs would probably
say.
Jenny:
Yep. Yep. Faith clocks the man—the recently
reinstalled manacles, strung
casually from the wall nearby, and is like, “Whatever butters your bread, man.”
[laughter] Or whatever.
Kristin:
I like that you made your own Faith-ism up.
Jenny:
She would say it.
Kristin:
She would! It was a—you did a good job. We
have another guest. [cheers]
Who really, really, really needed to talk about this particular sexy scene. [cheers]
Rosemary Maybe, will you please come to stage? [cheers and applause] Look at
Rosemary! Oh my god, and you brought me my beer, you beautiful, beautiful angel.
I’m gonna give you a proper intro, are you ready? Rosemary Maybe is a Buffering
Facebook mod, [cheers] drag queen, burlesque dancer, archivist, and several other
nouns. [laughter and cheers] She has been a Buffy fan as long as she can
remember and learned about sex through reading Spuffy fanfic on her Gateway
2000 at her parents’ house in the Chicago suburbs. [cheering and applause]
Jenny:
[laughs] Hell yeah!
Kristin:
She believes this makes her uniquely qualified
to guest on this pod.
[cheers] Please contact her for fanfiction links after the show, if desired. [cheers]
Welcome, Rosemary.
Rosemary:
Hi.
Kristin:
What—what are you—what is—
Jenny:
Who’s this?
Kristin:
What is on the table?
Rosemary:
Well, I heard this was a show about vampires.
So Kristin requested—
Kristin:
Ohh, oh my god, I’m so excited.
Rosemary:
Requested—I have several cosplays, several
outfits. Most recently,
Nadja from What We Do in the Shadows. [cheers and applause] And Kristin
requested [Kristin squeals] that I bring my little Najda doll.
Kristin:
Does she, like, go on you hand?
Rosemary:
You know, she could. She’s pretty adaptable,
I would say.
Kristin:
Look at her!
Rosemary:
And I got this from Etsy—
Kristin:
Hi!
Rosemary:
And the artist actually makes a smaller
doll so that your doll also can
have a doll. [laughter]
Jenny:
Wow.
Rosemary:
She’s very small.
Kristin:
We should link—in the show notes, we will
link how
you
can get your own
Nadja doll with her own Nadja doll.
Rosemary:
Yes. [laughs]
Kristin:
Thank you for bringing her to stage.
Rosemary:
So welcome.
Kristin:
She’s beautiful.
Rosemary:
I love horny vampires. [laughter and cheers]
Kristin:
That does mean that this scene is uniquely suited for you.
Rosemary:
It’s true. I said, “Kristin, please put
me on the horny basement scene.”
Kristin:
Mmhmm. I know, I was like, “Rosemary, which
scene?” Come on! [Jenny
laughs] We knew which one.
Rosemary:
Yep.
Kristin:
So tell us some of your thoughts. How do
you feel about this scene? Is
it—does it work for you? What are your favorite parts?
Rosemary:
It works for me on a deep level. [laughter]
Jenny:
How deep, precisely? [Kristin laughs] [cheers]
Rosemary:
This is a kid’s show. [laughter] No, it
was—so watching this when I was
a teen, who was not out yet. I thought Spike was so hot, I thought Faith so neat
and I wanted to be her friend.
Kristin:
Yes. Yes.
Jenny:
Best friends. [laughter]
Rosemary:
Best friend, and her to not be friends with
anyone else. [laughter]
Kristin:
Yeah! [laughs]
Jenny:
Nice.
Rosemary:
Ever. Especially boys.
Kristin:
Just your friend.
Rosemary:
Just my friend.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Rosemary:
So pansexual panic 2K03. [laughter]
Kristin:
A pansexual panic is actually just called
panic. [laughter]
Rosemary:
Oh, no! You’re correct. [Jenny and Kristin laugh] But yeah, it’s just so
charged with them. And the fact that they did not hook up with Buffy also? [cheers]
Jenny:
That we see.
Kristin:
That—I was gonna—I was literally like, I
mean, it’s not on the screen, but
that doesn’t mean…
Rosemary:
I have the links. [laughter] If you would
like that, I have the links.
Kristin:
Buffy comes down, she’s mad, right? But then
what happens after she’s
mad?
Rosemary:
Fade to black. [laughter]
Jenny:
None of our business. [laughter]
Kristin:
That’s the kind of “none of our business”
that I actually would like to see.
[laughter]
Rosemary:
Correct. Oh yeah, a pillow fight.
Jenny:
Uh-oh.
Rosemary:
Spike and a pillow fight.
Kristin:
You see—you think—you’re like, “oh, a pillow
fight. How cliche.” And then
you’re like, unless… [laughter] Pillow fights, they’re for everyone.
Rosemary:
It’s true.
Kristin:
Unless you have an allergy to down. [laughter]
Rosemary:
The way that they flirt is just so smart
and, like, so charged. And, like,
her body language? Like, that big stretch that she does? Like, she knows exactly
what she’s doing. And I just respect it so much. [laughter and cheers]
Kristin:
I do too. I have a question for you.
Rosemary:
I have an answer.
Kristin:
‘Cause you do drag and you do burlesque. And it feels like those are things
that could make a person more comfortable in their body, doing gestures like that.
Rosemary:
I’ve done it, yes.
Kristin:
Because it—well, I ask you because, like,
I watch Faith do that and I’m
like, yeah, no. So do you think that with the proper training, I too could be able to
do what Faith does?
Rosemary:
I think that I can…get a syllabus together.
[laughter]
Kristin:
Great.
Rosemary:
We can have homework assignments.
Kristin:
Okay.
Rosemary:
We’ll make it happen.
Kristin:
Next live show is September. I’ll practice.
[cheers and applause]
Jenny:
Good.
Kristin:
Okay, okay. Let’s go back into the scene.
I actually am, like, nerding out.
Like, wanna talk to you about body positivity through burlesque and drag. But we’re
gonna go back into the scene. You watched this as a teen?
Rosemary:
Mmhmm.
Kristin:
Did you have the benefit of watching it on
your own, or were you in the
room with adults?
Rosemary:
[sighs] I believe the first time, I was
in the room with adults. [Jenny
groans] My mom had a habit of showing me things that she should not have been
showing me. [laughter] And she’s very—she’s an incredibly intelligent woman, but
very, very ditzy. So she showed me, like, Fast Times at Ridgemont High—
Kristin:
[simultaneously] I understand this. Yeah.
Rosemary:
When I was, like, twelve. And the whole
time she was watching it, she
was like, [whispers] “I don’t remember this part.” [laughter] But…
Kristin:
Oh no!
Rosemary:
Afterwards, I did watch it on my own. [laughter]
Kristin:
I just always—’cause I didn’t watch this
show as a young person, you
know? And so now, watching it as an adult, I’m like, oh my god. I just feel for all of
you out there. Who had to watch this—yeah.
Rosemary:
But then I found the fanfiction after, and
like I said, I learned about sex
through Spuffy fanfiction.
Kristin:
Fuck yeah! [cheers]
Rosemary:
Faith is a frequent guest star. [laughter]
Kristin:
I’m sure there is more that you wanna talk
about in this scene, but I just
wanna take a serious moment, to thank—because it’s very cool that we had a
liveshow in Philadelphia, where we got to talk to Jeremy. Jeremy! [cheers and
applause] And then right after that, had a liveshow here in Chicago and get to
speak with you. Because the most—I think, anyway—the most powerful part of the
podcast is the community that exists outside of the podcast and what you all do for
each other.
Rosemary:
Mmhmm.
Kristin:
And Rosemary, and Jeremy, are the fucking—you
guys are the fucking
best. You really are. [cheers and applause] And I just—I’m just so thankful that we
get to, like, actually be here and talking to you in real life!
Rosemary:
Thank you! Yeah.
Kristin:
So thank you for being here.
Rosemary:
Thank so much! Yeah, and I wanna shout out
the other mods on the
Facebook group, too. Siobhan, Alia, Kimberly, Nicolette and Mack helps a ton too.
So—
Kristin:
Yes! [applause]
Jenny:
So we’ll be doing a little tour.
Rosemary:
Yeah.
Jenny:
Of five more cities. [laughter]
Kristin:
The Facebook mod tour, 2023! [Jenny makes
sound effect]
Rosemary:
Y’all make it easy to do, though. Like,
the community is so chill.
Someone in crowd:
Alia’s here!
Rosemary:
Oh, hi, Alia!
Kristin:
Oh, Alia—Alia is like—
Rosemary:
Hello!
Kristin:
[chanting] Hawaii, Hawaii, yeah.
Rosemary:
But y’all have created such a lovely community.
It’s really—it’s not a lot
of work. To do. [laughs] I shouldn’t—it’s so much work. [laughter] I should pretend
like it’s more work.
Kristin:
We are thankful for all of the work or non-work
that—whatever
you—whatever magic you are doing, we are very thankful for it.
Rosemary:
Thank you.
[someone in crowd says something] [laughter]
Kristin:
Alia, working from the audience. Please add
your image descriptions in
Facebook, thank you so much. It’s like, Faith sits sultrily on…the desk, removing her
jacket in a way that no other person has ever been able to accomplish. Rosemary,
are there any other key sexy points? Or non-sexy points that you’d like to talk
about with us tonight?
Rosemary:
I was not a fan of Season 7 at all. This
was, like, the highlight for me,
growing up. I’m enjoying it a bit more on the second watch. But…Buffy was so
formative. I have, like—I have a little story, if it’s cool.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Rosemary:
‘Cause Jeremy shared a James Marsters story
on their show, so I feel
like I must—I must too.
Kristin:
[laughs] This is a safe space for James Marsters
stories.
Rosemary:
Thank you so much. So me and my—who I am
going to be calling my
current wife from now on.
Jenny:
Nice. [laughter]
Rosemary:
We—
Jenny:
Keep them on their toes! At all times! [laughter]
Rosemary:
So we went to Portland Wizard World ‘cause
they were having that
huge Buffy panel. And she got me a photo op with James. And he, like, will look
right
into your eyes—
Kristin:
Yeah.
Rosemary:
When he is talking to you. He’ll look directly
into your eyes. And I was
telling him how I, like, saw his band Ghost of the Robot when I was, like, thirteen
with my mom [cheers] and so many other people’s moms [laughter] at this, like,
show in Chicago. And it was just me and so many middle-aged women, so great.
And he was so stoked and so lovely and he gave me a hug. And I was so overcome.
I calmly walked back to the back of the convention center, I slid down the wall, I
just cried for a little bit.
Kristin:
[laughs] Sure. Sure.
Rosemary:
And then we immediately got engaged. [cheers]
Jenny:
You and James?!
Rosemary:
No, god! [laughter] Wouldn’t that have been
a better story? [laughter]
Kristin:
Breaking news.
Rosemary:
She is only my current wife. [laughter]
Kristin:
My current wife is James Marsters. [laughter]
Wow!
Rosemary:
Yeah, we got engaged and then immediately
went to a strip club. It
was a great time.
Kristin:
Yes! [cheers] Rosemary, thank you for sharing
your Najda doll, your sexy
thoughts, your fanfiction, your engagement stories, and just everything about
yourself with us.
Rosemary:
Thank you guys for creating such a fantastic
community and show. And
seriously, get at me if you want fanfiction links, ‘cause I have so many. [cheers]
Kristin:
You have literally—you have, like, three
days to start a Patreon, so.
[laughter]
Rosemary:
I’ll do it.
Kristin:
Rosemary Maybe! [cheers and applause] The
James Marsters gasps from
the audience is my favorite part. James Marsters, he’ll look right into your eyes.
Somebody went, ohhhh. [laughter] And then Rosemary said something else about
James Marsters and from over here, I heard a [gasps]. [laughter] The power. Okay,
so these two are—[exhales]
Jenny:
Yeah…[Kristin rapidly deep-breathes] Faith
tells Spike about this guy she
used to hook up with who liked her to dress up as a schoolgirl with a bullwhip. And
for some reason, Spike cuts her off in the middle of this? [laughter]
Kristin:
It’s their—they’re, like—they’re playing
this, like, who’s the top? Are
you—like, who’s the top?
Jenny:
Right, right.
Kristin:
Are you the top, am I the top, are you the
top?
Jenny:
They’re both just like, wait. [laughter] That’s
why it doesn’t happen, they
can’t figure it out.
Kristin:
Right. But it’s—no, it’s clear—I think it’s
clear from the jump that, like,
Faith is the top, Spike knows Faith is the top, but they’re just doing their little, like,
dance, you know? And I like it. I like it. Actually, excuse me, but—
[SPIKE jingle plays]
Spike! I love you
Spike! So dreamy
Spike! Your trench coat
Spike! I love you
Spike! Your black nails
Spike! Peroxide
[cheers and applause]
Kristin:
Okay. They’re doing a lot of flirting. It
is established that Faith is the top,
everyone is comfortable with this. [cheers] The last movie that Faith saw in prison
was Glitter. [laughter]
Jenny:
Oh yeah, what’s Glitter about?
Kristin:
Glitter is about—
Jenny:
[laughing] Kristin?
Kristin:
A little child who is a singer and grows
up to be as good of a singer as
Mariah Carey. [laughter] Also, she falls in love. Glitter has a rating of 6% on Rotten
Tomatoes. [laughter] Based on 87 reviews, with an average score of 2.9 out of 10.
[laughter] The consensus states: “Glitter is a hodgepodge of movie cliches and bad
acting that’s sure to generate unintentional laughs. Unfortunately, the movie is not
bad enough to be good.” [crowd reacts and laughs]
Jenny:
But imagine if Mariah Carey was Mariah Carey
and then was also great at
being in a movie and making a great movie, too. Would that be fair?
Kristin:
I mean. Let us take a moment for fucking
Mariah Carey. [cheers] Do you
know the amount of times in my house that I say, “hey google, play Mariah Carey.”
All the time. I panicked that there was a google in the room. [laughter] Oh no! It’s
just—it doesn’t stop. Trust me, go home, talk to your robots. Tell them to play
Mariah Carey. [laughter] This is a pro Mariah Carey podcast, but Glitter was not
great. Okay. Something else important in this scene is that Faith and Spike are
talking about the fact that Faith could have left prison at any time. And Spike is like,
“You could have gone—there was nothing to stop you.” And Faith says, “I stopped
me.” [cheers] Yeah, and I—
Jenny:
Very cool, Faith.
Kristin:
Like, you know, definitely not fans of the
fucking prison system, at all.
[someone “boos”] Boo. Boo! [crowd boos] Big boo. However, I am a fan of the fact
that Faith is truly leaning into the fact that she has the power to control her own
self, in her own way, at her own time, at her own pace. Yes. Chef’s kiss. [cheers]
Jenny:
Faith also lets us know if you scratch the surface of any vanilla man.
[laughter] “It’s all naughty nurses and horny cheerleaders.” [laughs] Faith said, it’s
stepsisters all the way down. [laughter]
Kristin:
Oh, god. And you’re like, wow, this scene
is getting sexy, and then Faith is
like, “I’ve actually met you before?” [cheers] Roll the tape. She’s like, “I might have
said a few things.” Spike is like, “I’ve literally been on the planet Earth for, like, 172
years and I remember every fucking word you said to me. [laughter] Pretty sure
you said you could ride me at a gallop till my knees buckled? Pretty sure there was
warm champagne involved. It’s not the kind of thing a man forgets.” [cheers] It’s
not the kind of thing a person forgets. [laughter and cheers]
Jenny:
They also have a really great exchange where—kind
of coming off of this,
where Faith is like, “You should have known it wasn’t, ahh…[Kristin laughs] you
should have known Buffy wasn’t driving. Buffy would never.” And Spike’s like, “Oh,
[laughs].” [laughter]
Kristin:
And Faith’s like, [laughs questioningly]
[laughter] go on?
Jenny:
This comes to an end because Buffy enters the
chat. [laughter] And then,
Shannon is awake at the hospital and thus we must go.
Kristin:
[sighs] Back to the hospital. Alright, so—I
know. [crowd reacts] Listen. It’s
our—
Jenny:
Sorry, we have to talk about the whole thing.
[laughter]
Kristin:
It’s our fucking—
Jenny:
It’s our two girls in all the world—
Kristin:
It’s our job.
Jenny:
They alone—[makes “blah blah blah” sound] [laughter]
we’ll go fast
through this. Shannon tells them about Caleb, shows them her burn. Willow takes a
flash photo of the burn, for some reason. [laughter] It’s like, oh my god, it’s a
circle! [laughter] And they get Caleb’s message: “I have something of yours.”
Kristin:
It literally could be a stapler, poised to
Giles. [laughter] We then move to
the standing meeting.
Jenny:
Yeah.
Kristin:
I call it the standing—no one is allowed
to sit down, we are having a
standing meeting in the living room at Revello Drive.
Jenny:
Buffy’s like, “We don’t know anything. They
haven’t been tested. We should
go! This is a good plan, actually!”
Kristin:
Why?! Why?
Jenny:
Because! Because!
Kristin:
I know. It’s okay—like, it isn’t okay, but
it—I also just—I’m, like, following
Buffy on this journey of like, “I’m not okay, I’m not okay, I’m gonna do this thing.”
And she’s doing everything with, like, the fullest of herself, which means that every
time she fucks up, she fucks up with, like, the fullest of herself. [laughter] And you
know…[sighs] thank you, Alba. It is rough, yes. Okay. Oh, great, don’t worry—don’t
worry, everyone, we’re going to the vineyard.
Jenny:
Meanwhile at the evil vineyard, the First is
doing Caleb’s greatest hits.
[laughter] Here’s all the girls you killed after church.
Kristin:
To all the girls you’ve murdered before.
I’m sorry, it’s a live episode, it’s
whatever comes out of my mouth. [laughter] I can edit it out later, but if you’re
recording me, I have to be held accountable. [laughs] The giggler in the front of—I
like you. [laughter]
Jenny:
Swinging back.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Jenny:
To Revello Drive. Uhh…? Buffy, Faith, Spike,
Xander, Willow and Giles are
having this little meeting. And Giles is like, “We don’t know if he has anything.” And
Spike is like, “This could be a trap.” And Xander’s like, “This is probably a trap.” And
everyone’s like, “This is a trap.” And Buffy’s like, “No. You’re all idiots. And this is
what we’re doing, because I said so.”
Kristin:
Yeah. Yeah. It’s a big boo, but as somebody
who sometimes swings a little
too hard when I’m anxious…[sighs] you know. It’s hard to watch, but there’s
something to learn for some of us in this room.
Jenny:
And Buffy’s like, “Willow, I need you to stay
back and protect everyone. And
Giles, I need you to stay back because fuck you, Dad.” [laughter] “Help the girls
who still need a teacher,” she says. [crowd reacts] You’re a very reactive audience.
[laughter and cheers] Which I celebrate.
Kristin:
They’re full of malort!
Jenny:
Yeah! [laughter and cheers] There’s malort
running through your veins.
There are no vampires in Chicago because they tried and then they were like, “It’s
all malort.” [laughter and applause] [someone in crowd says something] Correct.
Kristin:
I just wanna—I don’t wanna go back to the
roleplaying in the vineyard. But
I just do wanna, like, give a moment to the fact that, like, I’ve been wondering
what the First is up to for a long time. And it’s just incredible to me that it’s
like—the First is like, sure, let’s play a little game. [laughter] I’m trying to end the
whole fucking world as we know it, but let’s play a little game. Okay. Oh my god,
we’re getting to my—one of my favorite Faith lines in this whole episode happens
next. So we’re now in the woods outside the vineyard. Faith and Buffy are walking.
They’re doing some reconnaissance.
Jenny:
Even Faith is like, “Wow, this is what a trap
would be. [laughter] For sure.
But I’m down—”
Kristin:
“I’m down!”
Jenny:
She’s DTT.
Kristin:
Literally! Do you remember when she jumped
in that hole? And Buffy was
like, “Don’t jump in that hole!”
Jenny:
[simultaneously] She did jump in that hole.
Kristin:
She jumped in that hole. Not
that
hole. [laughter]
Jenny:
Family. Show. Family. Show.
Kristin:
So my favorite part of this episode—okay,
that’s not true. But one of my
favorite lines is when they’re talking about the Bringers and Faith is like, “Wow.
They just—like, do they have sonar? Like, how do they move around like this?” And
then she just says, “So they just roam free around town?” [laughter] And I just love
this idea of Faith being like, I’ve been in Los Angeles and I was in prison before
that. And since I’ve been gone, you just have these guys walking around town?
Jenny:
With their curved little knives.
Kristin:
Do they go—like, are they at the Espresso
Pump? Like, I’d like a red eye.
[laughter] Okay. So Faith, like we said, says she’s with Buffy. Okay? And Buffy is
like—[Jenny inhales sharply] [laughs] It sounded like an angel was descending.
Jenny:
I…was just inhaling. Yep. [laughter]
Alba from audience:
It sounded like the Cordelia jingle.
Kristin:
Oh. Alba said it sounded like the Cordelia
jingle. Like this?
[CORDELIA jingle plays]
Cordelia… (ah-ahh)
I love you, Cordelia (ah-ahh)
You're perfect, Cordelia (ah-ahh)
Kristin:
Okay, so Buffy is like, “Why did you come
back? To—why’d you come back
to Sunnydale?”
Jenny:
No, she actually says, “Why are you here?”
[laughter] More like that. And
Faith’s like, “Do you not want me to be here?” And Buffy’s like, “No, I’m—I’m glad.
I’m glad you’re here.” It’s good. Thank you.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] She’s glad. She’s glad.
Jenny:
Thank you. And then she’s like, “Angel says
hi.” [laughter] Faith says,
“Angel says hi.” And Buffy says, “Really?” and Faith says, “Sure.” [laughter and
applause] Oh my god! And then they talk about Angel for a little bit, you know.
Buffy’s like, “How is he?” and Faith’s like, “Good, we just did this magical mindwalk
where I was, like, in his thoughts.” And Buffy’s like, “What?! [laughter] Was I there?
Did you see me? Were there any thoughts…of Buffy Summers? Therein?”
Kristin:
We have…we have a video to play for you with
somebody who has a lot of
Buffy and Angel thoughts, if you’re into it. [cheers]
[Video plays]
Jenny:
Oh my god!
Kristin:
These Angel on Top kids, they just keep bustin’
on in via video to our live
tapings.
Morgan:
Hello, ladies, enemies.
Jenny:
What?!
Kristin:
Oooh, wow, she went for you just as hard
as me. I didn’t think it was
gonna happen, but it did.
Morgan:
I can call a truce. For the purposes of today.
Jenny:
That would be great. I would love that.
Morgan:
Is that good?
Kristin:
Did you get LaToya’s prior consent for this,
or…?
Morgan:
No, don’t tell her. [laughter]
Kristin:
So Morgan, I think the reason that you were
summoned here is because
the name of a certain ensouled vampire just came out of a lot of people’s mouths,
namely Buffy and Faith. And you have some—do you have feelings about that?
Morgan:
A couple. It’s been awhile since Buffy and
Angel saw each other, right?
You know, it’s been a minute. Now, brought up out of the blue. You know, she’s
already having intense conversation with what one could arguably say is her ex.
[laughter] Only for her to bring up her other ex? [laughter]
Jenny:
Oh my god.
Morgan:
I gotta say, in watching this episode—and
I have not been joining you
guys for all of Season 7, in terms of my rewatch. She’s in a bad mood. [laughter]
And you know, I think that’s valid. I think there’s a lot of stuff going on.
Jenny:
Mmhmm.
Morgan:
But it does seem like she could use something
in her life to cheer her up.
And I know it’s perhaps cliche, it’s perhaps…in some ways, regressive to say she
needs to get laid. But. [laughter] I don’t know if you guys have been watching
Angel lately, but he is also not in a good mood. [laughter] I propose…
Kristin:
Mmhmm.
Morgan:
A meeting of the minds.
Kristin:
You do know what…you do know what happens
if they…you know what—
Jenny:
She said of the
minds
, not of the—
Morgan:
I said of the
minds
, not of the—you know—
Kristin:
Right before that, she said Buffy needed
to get laid, so I just was
connecting dots. [laughs]
Morgan:
Now, look. Here’s what I’m saying. I’m saying,
we need some good, old
fashioned, nondenominational, something in it for everyone, dream sex. [cheers]
Jenny:
Oooh.
Morgan:
This is what I am pitching. I’m talking, Graduation
Day, post blood
drinking—which in a way, isn’t it even more intimate than…having sex?
Jenny:
Mm, mmhmm.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Morgan:
Like, they need to dream bang it out. And
then the both of them wake up,
like, kind of, like, feeling themselves a little more. Like, in like, slightly better
moods. Gunn is like, “Did you see Angel smile?” [laughter] Which like, a smile for
Angel, so it’s like, the corner lifted a little bit. [laughter]
Jenny:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Morgan:
This is what I want for them.
Kristin:
Counterpoint. She could just have more sex
with Faith. [cheers]
Morgan:
You know what—
Jenny:
Your other ex is already in town.
Kristin:
Right there, she’s right there.
Morgan:
It’s such a good point. I guess I was like—the
dream will, like, not create
any consequences. ‘Cause they’ll both be like, that was a weird dream, and then
they’ll both feel better. But you make such a good point.
Kristin:
Morgan, I can’t believe that you showed up
to our Fuffy weekend, with
your Bangel self. [laughter] I can’t believe it.
Morgan:
They’re just beautiful. And they’re so sweet
and they’re so sad and
they’re so goth. And I just know that one day, they’re gonna kiss so hard, it fixes
everything. [laughter and cheers]
Jenny:
Do you think that there might be a specific,
like, music cue that would rise
in the background, at that incredible event?
Morgan:
Yes. I do think so. And I think—
Jenny:
How would it go?
Kristin:
Yeah.
Morgan:
It goes a little something like…[sings Buffy
and Angel’s theme tune]
[laughter and applause]
[Video ends]
[cheers and applause]
Kristin:
Ohh. Okay, wait. A moment—a moment. I just—anyone
in the audience
who feels so inclined to please—okay. Jenny, can you start them? No, don’t do that.
I wanna film them. [laughter]
Jenny:
Oh! Sure, yes.
Kristin:
Can you please start them off so they can
fucking sing the Angel/Buffy
theme right now? [laughter] I know they want—I can hear them out there. Go
ahead.
Jenny:
[yelling to crowd] Two! Three! Four!
[crowd sings Buffy and Angel’s theme]
[laughter and applause]
Kristin:
[sighs happily] Alright. Okay. Let’s take
it home.
Jenny:
Okay, so…this whole Angel mindwalk-whatever business is interrupted by
them arriving at the evil vineyard. And they’re like, okay, now we know
headquarters is. So back at the Summers house—[laughs]
Kristin:
[disappointed] Oh.
Jenny:
Xander’s telling everyone to aim for the eyes
and the heart. [crowd reacts]
Kristin:
She’s—what?
Jenny:
I mean, we’ve all watched the episode in preparation
for this taping, right?
Kristin:
[simultaneously] We know what happens! [laughter]
Jenny:
Xander said it, not me. [laughter]
Kristin:
We didn’t do it! [laughter] But see, I love—I
love this moment, for Xander.
Because it’s like, he’s so emphatically explaining everything he’s learned over the
last seven seasons. And he, like, really knows a lot of shit. He’s like, “vampire, this
is the way. Bringer, this is the way. Some other thing, don’t get distracted by the
tentacles—”
Jenny:
I’m always getting distracted by the tentacles,
myself. [laughter]
Kristin:
It’s just like, you know—you know we have
complicated relationships with
Xander. But I—I have a lot of love for him in this scene, in many ways.
Jenny:
It’s nice. Good job. Good job, Xander. There’s
also a little moment for one of
our most beloved couplings, question mark? Uhh, in which there’s, like, a little bit of
Godzilla talk brought into the larger conversation. [laughter] And Amanda asserts
that Matthew Broderick killed Godzilla and Andrew’s like, “Xander! Tell her! Explain
it to her!” [laughter] Xandrew rides again. [cheers] Rona, very reasonably—very
consistently reasonable.
Kristin:
[laughing] Very consistently reasonable.
Jenny:
Says, “I came here for protection. I don’t
want to die.” [crowd affirms] Call
me old fashioned.
Kristin:
Yeah, “this plan is trouble.” Correct.
Jenny:
Correct. Then Xander gives a little speech.
Kristin:
Yeah, well, and it does pivot off of something,
I think, that Rona says,
which is, “This plan is trouble.” Correct. “Buffy doesn’t care how many of us she
puts in danger.” And I think that’s the piece that Xander, like, jumps off of, when he
gives his speech, you know?
Jenny:
Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin:
Because it’s possible that Xander also thinks
that this plan is not great. But
his speech isn’t about if the plan is or isn’t great. It’s about, like, the fact that
whatever Buffy does, her intentionality is to protect us. And that does not mean
that the plan is good. It does not mean that the impact is good, when your
intentions are good. But yeah, do you wanna talk about his speech, or do you want
me to talk about his speech?
Jenny:
Sure. He’s all like, [dramatically] “She’s
stopped everything she’s ever come
up against. She died twice and she’s still standing.”
Kristin:
She has to talk like this ‘cause she’s wearing
a duster.
Jenny:
[dramatically] “You’re scared and that makes
sense, but Buffy cares about
you so much.” I actually have a note from Alba—producer Alba, to be specific.
[cheers]
[PRODUCER ALBA jingle plays]
Producer Alba!
Kristin:
Hello, Alba.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Hey. Hey, Alba.
Kristin:
Are you gonna read this—do you know what
it is? No. Tonight, I was like,
“Alba, did you have to wait in line?” ‘cause there are other people that are, like, on
the guest list, we don’t know if they have to wait in line. Alba was like, “I did not
wait in line.” [laughter]
Alba:
Guys, it’s—
Kristin:
And I was like, everybody needs to get some
fucking Alba energy. You
know what I mean?
Alba:
Listen, listen. It’s Leo season. [laughter]
Okay?
Jenny:
It is.
Alba:
It’s Leo season. For those of you who do not
know, I am a Leo. [laughter]
Kristin:
Leos like to tell you they’re Leos in Leo
season. [laughter]
Alba:
Actually, my birthday’s tomorrow. [cheers] Yes,
I know that! Okay, thank you
so much for having me up here. Hi, Chicago.
Jenny:
Oh my gosh, thank you for sending us such wonderful
notes. This one really
sang to me.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] Oh, it says “from Alba.”
[laughs]
Alba:
[simultaneously] From Alba. It’s in bold, you
guys. It’s important.
Whew—[crosstalk]
Kristin:
Read your words to us.
Alba:
This was, like, two weeks ago, fuck. [laughter]
Kristin:
Two weeks ago, Alba had this thought, read
to you by present day Alba.
[laughter]
Alba:
After two Cosmos and a few beers earlier.
Kristin:
Cosmos?!
Alba:
They’re on tap!
Kristin:
Ohh.
Jenny:
It’s Leo season! [laughter] Come on! [cheers]
Alba:
Okay, also, this is my Faith boob…situation.
[cheers] Thank you so much,
thank you. Thanks.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] There it is. Now you’ve all
seen it.
Kristin:
Four boobs, no waiting.
Alba:
Six—? No, yeah, four.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] No. Just four.
Alba:
Yeah, just four. [laughter] Jenny! Do you even
have boobs, though?
[laughter] It’s none of our business, as Jenny would say.
Jenny:
Mmm.
Alba:
It’s none of our business. [laughs] I get it.
The front row is—they get it.
Jenny:
They’re rowdy.
Alba:
The front row gets it, they laugh. Alright.
Okay, from Alba. [laughter] From
me. I say, “Xander’s speech about Buffy is very, very cute, but Buffy is literally
unhinged in this episode.” [laughter] Right? Yeah, she’s fucking unhinged. I agree
with past self. “I’m also—I’m just also having a hard time thinking that she would
want to fight Caleb right away, after the Turok-Han almost killed her without
blinking.” Right? Like, the last thing that the First sent her, like, hello? Giles was
like, “She might die,” and we were all like, holy crap, she might die from internal
bleeding, I don’t know. Anyway. “Like.” I said this. I said “like,” no comma, but I
meant comma. “Like, when the First has an ally, that ally is pretty fucking powerful.
Except the Bringers.” ‘Cause they’re freaky…they’re freaky joes.
Kristin:
They’re freaky joes. They are. [laughter]
Alba:
They’re not that powerful.
Jenny:
They do what they do. There’s a lot of them.
Kristin:
Yeah.
Alba:
I was gonna say.
Kristin:
And they have those freaky joe knives.
Alba:
Power in numbers. Okay.
Jenny:
Mmhmm, mmhmm, mmhmm.
Alba:
“Except the Bringers, but still. Buffy, what
the fuck?” [laughter and applause]
Thank you. Thank you, Chicago, thank you.
Kristin:
[inaudible]
Jenny:
Good, it’s good. [cheers and applause] Oh my
god.
Kristin:
Producer Alba! [cheers and applause]
Jenny:
Oh, is it Leo season?
Kristin:
[laughs] Is Gaby Dunn also a Leo?
Jenny:
No, Gaby’s a Gemini.
Kristin:
Okay. [cheers] Oh!
Jenny:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.
Kristin:
Don’t ever put Alba and Gaby in the same
room. Okay, sorry, I’m sorry!
You just gave me some serious Gaby vibes.
Jenny:
[simultaneously] Okay, okay, okay. No other
signs exist in Leo season.
[laughter]
Kristin:
We know, we know, we know. Alright. So Xander
gives this beautiful
speech. They go to battle…
Jenny:
Wait, please.
Kristin:
Wait, please.
Jenny:
Wait, please. While Xander’s giving this little
speech, Buffy and Faith
happen to enter, and Faith’s like, “Damn. I never knew you were that cool.”
[laughter] And Buffy—well, you know what she says. [Kristin laughs] The point is
that they are in love.
Kristin:
They are in love.
Jenny:
And it’s nice.
Kristin:
It’s just so clear that the people who would
enjoy kissing each other the
most are Buffy and Faith. [crowd affirms and cheers]
Jenny:
So they go to the evil vineyard, and then, they stand right outside the door
of the evil vineyard, [Kristin laughs] as my beautiful current wife, Jess Abbott,
observed while we were watching earlier today. And they announce their plan,
clearly. [laughter] They project, they enunciate. They’re like, “This is what we are
doing. And here we go!” [laughter] So A Team goes into the vineyard. And they’re
like, oh, it’s an
evil
vineyard. And Spike says, “Like
Falcon Crest.” Kristin. Falcon
Crest—
Kristin:
Yes.
Jenny:
Is a soap opera about, like, wine people? [laughter]
And I’m telling you this
because Spike is just still on his soaps. [laughter and cheers]
Kristin:
Wine people?
Jenny:
Like, people who have a vineyard, I think.
Kristin:
Okay.
Jenny:
I did just enough research to get…that far.
Kristin:
There, okay. [laughter] I also actually have
a vineyard fact, which is that
these—this vineyard—these vineyards? This vineyard or these vineyards? [people in
crowd speak] Thank you, this vineyard is called Shadow Valley Vineyards. Malcolm
Reynolds, a character from the show Firefly, which I have seen because I know
about everything on television.
Jenny:
Mm!
Kristin:
Malcolm Reynolds is born on a planet called
Shadow, and fought in the
Battle of Serenity Valley.
Jenny:
Coincidence?! Where’s my magnifying glass?
[laughter]
Kristin:
We think not!
Jenny:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kristin:
So then, Bummer Town, USA—
Jenny:
Yeah, yeah.
Kristin:
Population: Potentials.
Jenny:
Yes, the fighting begins and at first, things
are going well, ‘cause it’s the
Bringers. Then all of the Bringers scurry off into the shadows.
Kristin:
They’re like, “where are the freaky joes?”
[laughter]
Jenny:
They finish giving Buffy and company the ol’
razzle-dazzle, [laughter] and
disperse. And—
Kristin:
God, the Turok-Han as the lead with the freaky
joes and the—[laughter]
everybody’s got top hats.
Jenny:
And here’s Caleb! And Buffy’s like, “I heard
you have something of mine.”
And Caleb—I’m so sorry to be the one to tell you this—
Kristin:
[simultaneously] He’s like, “It’s a stapler.”
Jenny:
Says, “Well, I do now.” The last thing you
wanna hear when you’re in an
evil vineyard, going toe-to-toe with a new big bad you just met, five episodes away
from your series finale. [laughter]
Kristin:
Yeah, truly bad fucking news. He’s like,
“The Slayer? You’re the Slayer?
The strongest, the fastest, the most aflame?” Points for that. “With that most
precious invention of all mankind, the notion of goodness.” And then he punches
her clear across the room in a way that all of us hate to see. Because we need her
to be strong enough to not be punched across the room, because if she can be
punched across the room, then all of us are toast.
Jenny:
Then Caleb bops Spike to the floor. And throws
him into a barrel that is so
large. [laughter] It cannot possibly be representative of something that happens at
a real vineyard. Please, god, tell me this is fake. [laughter] It’s so big. Wine goes
everywhere. Then Caleb…breaks Rona’s arm. [crown groans]
Kristin:
And like, Caleb—I mean, I think this is—it’s
horrible to watch, but it’s also,
I think, good writing in that, like, Caleb is there not to necessarily kill—only. He’s
there to let everyone there know how strong this power is. And he’s gonna do that
in a million ways, so that they all leave hurting and doubting. And like, that is the
most powerful tool that, you know, evil has, or whatever.
Jenny:
He—oh my god. He breaks another barrel with a Faith projectile.
He—[groans] god. He picks up—well, he breaks a Potential’s neck, and then he
picks Molly up by the throat and does a little stab.
Kristin:
Molly!
Jenny:
I’m so sorry. Actually, no Potentials were
harmed in the filming…[laughter]
of this television show. So we can feel better. It’s okay, everyone.
Kristin:
Yeah, the actor playing Molly is—
Jenny:
Did not actually have to die for the role.
Kristin:
Did not—yep. It’s true. It’s just ketchup!
[laughs]
Jenny:
And so, they retreat. But before they retreat,
one other thing—
Kristin:
Well. [crowd reacts] But like, backing up
a couple clicks.
Jenny:
Mmm.
Kristin:
Xander has an incredible shot to save Rona.
Like, Rona’s arm gets broken,
but Xander saves Rona by shooting into the arm of the Bringer that is going to—
Jenny:
Stab her, mmhmm.
Kristin:
Fancy-knife stab her. And then—and then—okay,
it was just one thing
before this thing.
Jenny:
Okay, you’re ready now?
Kristin:
Yeah. I was just—[crowd reacts negatively]
Jenny:
Then…seven seasons, we hate him! He’s the worst!
[laughter] But we’d like
him to have both of his eyes. [laughter] Or at the very least, we’d like to not be
there when that changes. [laughter]
Kristin:
It’s none of our business!
Jenny:
It’s none of our business. [laughter and applause]
I will note, that though
this little poke happens. [laughter] It is notably broken up by one man. And that is
Spike. [cheers] Doing a little tackle to save his little boyfriend. [cheers] Okay?
Kristin:
Yeah, okay. I agree. Good job.
Jenny:
Okay, then we get some closing sort of, like,
here’s some bad stuff and
here’s some other bad stuff and here—here’s the hospital. Ohh, Xander’s got his
eye patched over. Rona’s arm is in a cast. Go to the Summers house, everyone’s
fucked up with the hydrogen peroxide, you know?
Kristin:
[simultaneously] And like, looking at Buffy,
you know?
Jenny:
And Buffy is walking around State Street like…[laughter]
you know?
Kristin:
I think—I think—I don’t want to say what
Caleb says, but I think that
maybe I should say what Caleb says.
Jenny:
The whole thing?
Kristin:
Okay, just a little.
Jenny:
No, no, you should say the whole thing, ‘cause
I watched it a few times and
I was like, I don’t know if he gets all the way there with what he is trying to say. I
think I’d like to mark this up and have him do a new draft.
Kristin:
[simultaneously] My last—my last note is
“woof,” which means I think he
might have.
Jenny:
Okay, go ahead.
Kristin:
I don’t know. Okay, so he says, “Now, it's
a simple story. Stop me if you've
heard it. I have found and truly believe that there is nothing so bad it cannot be
made better with a story. And this one’s—” [stops abruptly]
Jenny:
Go ahead. I was just looking. It’s not a secret.
[laughter]
Kristin:
“And this one’s got a happy ending. There
once was a woman, and she was
foul, like all women.” Shoutout to foul women.
Jenny:
Ayyo! [cheers] Welcome to Foul Women Weekend!
[laughter and cheers]
Kristin:
“There once was a woman, and she was foul,
like all women, for Adam's
rib was dirty—just like Adam himself—for what was he, but human. But this woman,
she was filled with darkness, despair, and why? Because she did not know. She
could not see. She didn't know the good news, the glory that was coming. That'd be
you.” He’s talking to Buffy the First. “For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are
yours, now and—” you didn’t think you were going to church today, did you?
[laughter] “For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and forever.
You show up, they'll get in line. 'Cause they followed her. And all they have to do is
take one more step, and I'll kill them all. See? I told you it had a happy ending.”
[someone in crowd boos]
Jenny:
Lacks clarity. [laughter] Cite your sources.
[laughter]
Kristin:
I think that the piece that fucks me up is
just that Buffy is fucked up, and
she does have people following her. And Caleb is banking on the fact that they will
follow her like they did tonight, and that is how evil will take over the world, and
that’s scary. Like, we know—I mean, it’s been seven seasons and we’ve seen Buffy,
like, fuck up a bunch, but also always, in a pinch, like, figure it the fuck out. But
it’s—I don’t know, I feel scared. I know how the show ends. I feel scared. [sighs]
Good thing we have the Sexual Tension Awards. [cheers]
[SEXUAL TENSION AWARD jingle plays]
Sexual tension award!
Jenny:
Well! Welcome back to another thrilling installment
of the Sexual Tension
Awards! Hurray! [cheers] For this edition, we are joined by the very horny people of
Chicago, Illinois. [cheers] Oh, yes. And we have prepared—[thinking
sounds]—exactly eight noms, [cheers] that will fit—
just
fit into the four slots.
[laughter] For today’s…excitement. In the first slot. Now, there isn’t technically a
gigantic monster in this slot. But this slot’s filling—
Kristin:
[simultaneously] That’s what she said. [laughter]
Jenny:
This slot’s filling was inspired by a gigantic
monster. Two dudes, one giant
lizard. [laughter] It’s Xandrew. You’re welcome. [cheers] In the second slot. Should
I say—oh, there’s something so terrible I could say, but I’ll hold back. [crowd reacts
negatively] No, you’re not gonna like it! You’re gonna—you say that now, and I say
it, and you’re gonna make a terrible noise. Well! In this slot, there’s room for one
thumb. [crowd reacts] [laughs] Nothing says “I love you” like saving your boyfriend
from getting his little eye poked out by an evil preacher, it’s Spander. [cheers] The
patron saints of Dirty Girls Weekend. [cheers] They each have special relationships
to Angel, special relationships to Spike, and special relationships to each other.
Please welcome Fuffy to the third slot! [cheers] But my friends, as aflame as they
are, I think you might like the contents of slot number four the most, perhaps. One
of them is shirtless. [cheers] Both of them are smoking. The manacles, thank god,
are very nearby, it’s Spaith! [cheers] Please join us this episode and every episode.
Make your voice heard in our beautiful democracy. Vote in the Twitter poll, which

made. [laughter]
Jenny:
Of my dog? Thank you?

N-O-E-L-I-N-E
[cheers]
Kristin:
You know, you have a baby and you name them,
and could you ever
imagine that, like, then, 41 years later, they’ll be like, [sings] “N-O-E-L-I—” with,
like, an audience of 250 people? Just spelling their middle name? [laughter]
Jenny:
It’s hard for me to imagine anything that would
take forty-
one
years.
[crowd reacts] That’s at least one year longer than I can imagine. [laughter]
Kristin:
Let me amend this. When I’m not being roasted
by Jenny Owen Youngs.
You can use the spelling of my name to find me also on social media, Twitter and
Instagram, though I don’t make reels or Tiktok yet.
Jenny:
