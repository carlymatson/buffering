Buffering the Vampire Slayer
Episode 2.17: Passion
[THEME MUSIC]
Jenny​: [slowly, sadly] Hello and welcome.
Kristin:​ [laughing] Oh, no!
Jenny:​ This is a dark day.
Kristin:​ No, no. Don’t bring the people down.
Jenny:​ Alright, this is a rough episode but we are going to do our best to
buoy ourselves, and you, up towards the surface. Hello!
Kristin:​ There it is!
Jenny:​ And welcome to Buffering the Vampire Slayer; a podcast where we
are watching and discussing every episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, even
the ones that make us want to leap off a bridge. I am Jenny Owen Youngs.
Kristin:​ And I am Kristin Russo, and this week, despite not wanting to talk
about it, we will be discussing Season 2, Episode 17 “Passion”. Stay tuned at
the end of this podcast every week for an original song written by us
recapping the Buffy episode we are discussing.
Jenny:​ “Passion” was written by Ty King, you terrible person, and directed
by Michael Gershman, who wants you to feel a lot of pain. It originally aired
on February 24th, 1998.
Kristin:​ This is the one where Angel steps up his torment of Buffy and her
friends as Jenny searches for a way to restore his soul. Is that how you
would describe this one, Jenny?
Jenny:​ This is the one where Jenny Calendar... bites it. That’s how I would
describe it.


Kristin:​ Yeah, I mean that’s what we all know this episode to be. A painful,
painful episode, and you know, to start us off with a larger thought I think
that the pain in this episode, for me, is less about losing Jenny, and more
about Giles losing Jenny. You know what I mean? It’s less about me, Kristin,
being like, “I can’t believe I’ve lost this character, this person,” and more
about me like mourning through Giles. And like-Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin:​ Travelling through Giles.
Jenny:​ Yeah, as much as it is a terrible, terrible, wounding, traumatizing
experience to watch Willow be in pain, who knew, who could have predicted,
that seeing Giles in pain-Kristin:​ [talking over] Oh, Giles in pain.
Jenny: ​Giles in terrible pain, would be as effective and affecting.
Kristin:​ Right, and we’ll get to all of this. But let’s-- why don’t we start with
a nice, soulless vampire narrating us-Jenny:​ Mmm, just a little Angel V.O.?
Kristin: ​[laughing] Into the episode. [Quoting and imitating Angel] “Passion,
[Jenny laughs] it lies in all of us, it will stir, open its jaws, and howl.” Says
Angel.
Jenny:​ Yeah, he really does say that. He also says, “Passion rules us all and
we obey, what other choice do we have?”
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ By the time he says that, so we see him sort of like following Buffy
from a distance. Like, hanging out at the Bronze, drinking from the body of a
living person as Buffy, Xander, and Willow and Cordelia?
Kristin:​ Yeah.


Jenny:​ Leave the Bronze.
Kristin:​ Yeah, yeah they’re all four there because I made a note specifically
that this scene was so powerfully placed in the way of like, showing us that
she’s healing. And showing us that she’s getting back to herself.
Jenny:​ Yeaahhh…
Kristin:​ And that, of course she’s not…
Jenny:​ [Fake evil laughter] That’s what you thought!
Kristin: ​So I interrupted you mid-thought.
Jenny:​ Oh that’s okay, that’s okay. So then, uh, Buffy goes home and gets
ready for bed, turns out the lights, and we see Angel in his optimal,
preferred -Kristin:​ He knows where to stand.
Jenny:​ [laughs] Directly behind the blinds.
Kristin:​ He’s like ‘did somebody say blinds?’ [laughs]
Jenny:​ He’s just peeking through those mini-blinds.
Kristin:​ So, and this is creepy as fuck. This whole-Jenny:​ It’s creepy that he’s watching and watching and watching but then
once he gets inside and is touching her hair…
Kristin:​ Touching her face which-- this is important too because we know
Buffy is the Slayer. So we know that she has heightened senses. We know
that she’s a badass, we know that she’s really not going to be the person to
sleep through somebody in her bed with her, right? But I think this is so
deliberate. This whole episode I think is brilliant. Who did you say wrote this
episode?
Jenny:​ Ty King.


Kristin: ​Ty King, whoever you are, in the first 10 minutes I was like, “Who
wrote this?!” The lines, the dialogue is brilliant.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ And the whole arc of it, it’s like Buffy doesn’t feel Angel in bed with
her which I think is a direct line to how powerful Angel is, right? How
powerful he is in his strength but also in his-- what would you even call it?
Jenny:​ I’m not sure.
Kristin:​ Light as a feather, stiff as a board, you know what I mean?
Jenny:​ Right. Mythologically speaking, if you look at vampire lore, there’s a
lot of floating and levitating and walking soundlessly and gliding through the
night. And I think that some of that is being played on here.
Kristin:​ Yeah, it’s just-- and then of course he draws her like one of his
French girls…
Jenny:​ [disgusted] Ugh.
Kristin:​ This is an interesting character trait. We’ll see some real fun Angel
character traits as the series goes on and I think charcoal drawing is up
there-Jenny:​ Charcoal drawing in the dark-- well I guess he probably has night
vision.
Kristin:​ Yeah he has vampire vision. But yeah, he’s touching her face, he’s
sketching her, leaving her this note on her pillow.
Jenny:​ Right but as he gets to this last line, “Passion rules us all and we
obey, what other choice do we have?” He has touched her hair and now he’s
just sitting on her bed staring at her.
Kristin: ​Right.


Jenny:​ So... how twisted are we in this space? It’s like-- how else can you
interpret that other than like, he is beholden to-Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ A passion that we can’t understand and it’s-Kristin:​ Right.
Jenny:​ Sort of human, it’s like we can vaguely understand it as a human
concept but like, it’s passing through so many filters that are so far away
from our experience.
Kristin:​ No absolutely, I think that’s the whole reason, I mean I make fun of
this whole overarching narrator role-Jenny:​ It is goofy, but it’s also very effective.
Kristin:​ But it is because what he’s illustrating, what the words are
illustrating to us, I think are directly meant to underline what you’re talking
about Jenny, which is Angel is orbiting through passion the same as Buffy
and Giles and Jenny and all of us orbit through passion-Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ That he is not exempt from this at all. And this is why Spike is so
annoyed with him in this episode because he’s like, “Man, you’re telling me
you were in fucking bed with this girl, you were caressing her, you ​drew her,​
you drew her in charcoal? [Jenny laughs] This is not what we’re about,
you’re supposed to- kill the Slayer is the task!” and Angel is-- he’s falling off.
Jenny:​ Uh huh.
Kristin:​ He’s going down another Drusilla path, right? I mean we hear that a
lot of times in this episode too.
Jenny:​ Right.


Kristin:​ That he just can’t let it go and he has to not just kill her, he has to
destroy her. The worst kind of kill, right? The kind that taunts her, tempts
her-Jenny:​ Take her apart a piece at a time.
Kristin:​ Absolutely. And you know, I’m just-- I’m a little annoyed with how
she’s advised in the face of this right at the start of the episode.
Jenny:​ Yo.
Kristin: ​Right? It’s like-Jenny:​ It doesn’t make ​any sense​.
Kristin:​ No, I come to school, I tell you, “Hey, the biggest bad we’ve faced
up until now” I think Angel is a bigger bad than the Master-Jenny:​ In many ways, yes.
Kristin:​ Right? I mean I don’t know, maybe talk amongst yourselves.
Jenny:​ I mean he’s not as ancient and powerful but he’s also not trapped in
a wibble-wobble bubble and he also has free access to Buffy’s bedroom.
Kristin: ​Right, right. And so you show up, you tell your Watcher, “Hey man.
This guy that we’re all terrified of, he was in my ​room!​ He was in my room in
my bed with me--”
Jenny:​ While I was sleeping for long enough to draw me!
Kristin:​ “For long enough to draw me1” And then Buffy very reasonably
goes down this path of, “Hey, Angel told me that the way he does this is that
he goes after family first. My mom is in danger” and the advice she’s getting
is-Jenny:​ Is like, “don’t let him get in your head.” ...What?!


Kristin:​ What about “Don’t let him get in your bed!” Giles?! [Jenny laughs]
Come on man. So I was just a little frustrated but I understand the
reasoning, like I understand yes, they’re right. I mean Angel isn’t killing her
and [laughing] Cordelia has this great moment.
Jenny:​ Oh my god, she’s on Spike’s page. “Why doesn’t he just gruesomely
murder you?”
Kristin: ​Right, right. And so Giles, Cordelia, Willow, they’re all having this
conversation with Buffy and pointing out yes, it’s obvious that Angel doesn’t
want to just kill her because he hasn’t. So that’s where Giles is coming from
I think, but I just feel like, come on guys! Probably by the end of this
episode, everything has changed for how Giles would advise because
perhaps none of them really understood what was possible in such a short
amount of time for Angel. Maybe they thought that he was spinning a longer
yarn here. I don’t know, but I just was like-Jenny:​ It just doesn’t make a lot of sense.
Kristin:​ It didn’t make a ton of sense.
Jenny:​ What does make sense is Willow being the top pick to sub for Jenny
Calendar when she says she’s going to be late tomorrow morning.
Kristin:​ Oh my gosh, wait, we are not there yet.
Jenny:​ What? Oh, what did I miss?
Kristin:​ First of all, you missed one of my favorite scenes to date which is in
the library when Jonathan walks in. So this scene, right? We’re in the library,
we’ve talked about this on the show before, where is everybody in the
library? Nobody uses the Sunnydale library.
Jenny:​ It’s just tumbleweeds and Scoobies.
Kristin:​ And we get this ​beautiful​ scene of the show poking fun at itself,
really getting very meta and saying like, “Hey, we know, okay? We know.”
[Jenny laughs] And so in walks Jonathan, who we call Jonathan, he still
doesn’t have a name. I saw in the credits, it just said ‘Student’.


Jenny:​ Huh.
Kristin:​ Jonathan, at least in the credits of this episode, was not given a
name. He walks in with his buddy, they just need a book on Stalin.
Everybody flips out, Xander the most.
Jenny:​ Oh my god.
Kristin: ​Xander’s like “What in the world are you-- Is this a Barnes and
Noble?!” [Jenny laughs] And Giles has to talk Xander down and be like, “It’s
the school library Xander, I know we forget.”
Jenny:​ And Xander’s like, “Since when?!” Rightly so.
Kristin:​ Right, rightly so, Xander.
Jenny:​ If possession is nine-tenths of the law, students coming to check
books out must be nine-tenths of the space being the library, agreed?
Kristin:​ Right, yes. Agree, agree.
Jenny:​ [gasps] Is that some Hell Math?
Kristin: ​Oooo, Jenny I think it is.
[Hell Math jingle: Piano arpeggio plays. “Helllll Maaaaath”]
Kristin:​ Thank you for that Hell Math Jenny. The only other thing that I find
hilarious in this scene is the fact that they go up to get the-- first of all, Giles
knows where the Stalin books are, so that’s nice to know.
Jenny:​ Just off the top of his head.
Kristin:​ Yeah, he knows-Jenny:​ He’s...a real librarian, I guess?
Kristin:​ As Angel would call it, he knows where all the boogedy-boogedy


books are.
Jenny:​ [chuckles] Oh.
Kristin:​ He also knows where the classroom books are.
Jenny:​ Boogedy boogedy.
Kristin:​ So [laughing], I wasn’t going to get through the episode without
calling out the boogedy boogedy.
Jenny:​ I’m glad you said it.
Kristin: ​So then they go to find the Stalin books and everyone leaves.
Including the librarian [Jenny laughs]. And it made me think to myself,
‘Hmm, nobody else works at the library.’ Like no one.
Jenny:​ Just Giles.
Kristin:​ It’s just Giles runs the show so that means every time we see Giles
not in the library, [laughing] ​no one​ is in the library.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ So I don’t know how Jonathan-Jenny:​ Libraries basically just run themselves. And nobody goes by anyway.
Kristin: ​I don’t know, this was far before self checkout, you know? [They
both laugh] So the thing that we didn’t talk about when we were going on
and on about Giles and being upset about Giles’s response and Buffy being
worried about Joyce is that there’s a really important thing that happens
here where Buffy says, “Giles, I want to tell-- maybe I should tell my mom.”
Jenny:​ Oh yeah.
Kristin:​ And Giles is like, “Yo, no no no you can’t do that.” Xander makes
this hilarious joke, I thought it was hilarious--


Jenny:​ Yeah it’s really good.
Kristin:​ Where he’s like “Yeah, I mean the more people you tell, the less
cool it is for us to know,” right? But this is an ongoing plot line. We’ve talked
about it on the podcast before. Buffy is really feeling the pressure. She can’t
communicate anything to her mom, any part of what has happened. And
she’s still being told by Giles, “No, you gotta keep her in the dark, you have
to.”
Jenny:​ So ​then ​we go to the computer lab.
Kristin: ​So then we go to the computer lab.
Jenny:​ It is amazing to me-- Okay, there is not a millisecond of dead space
in this episode.
Kristin:​ No.
Jenny:​ And there’s so many valleys of sorrow and so many peaks of super
hilarity like Alyson Hannigan in so many spots is ​so​ funny.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ And this is one of them.
Kristin: ​And let’s just take a moment-- we don’t have Kate this week so I
will bring up some of my favorite fashion moments as we go. Holy shit
Willow in this scene. She’s wearing a blue and yellow butterfly sweater, her
hair is braided [Jenny laughs] and she has a smiley face emoji backpack,
okay? They weren’t emojis at the time, it was just a smiley.
Jenny:​ Proto-mojis.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Protomoji backpack on Willow. She looks adorable.
Adorable.
Jenny:​ [squealing] Awww, she looks so cute.
Kristin:​ And she’s so excited because Jenny Calendar has asked her to fill in


as a substitute.
Jenny:​ She’s excited and then she’s immediately terrified.
Kristin: ​Right.
Jenny:​ That her authority won’t be recognized.
Kristin:​ Right.
Jenny:​ [laughing] And that chaos will reign!
Kristin:​ Yes, that chaos-- That’s my favorite part is when Buffy gets there
and she’s like “[speaks quickly] I’m sorry Buffy, I know I’m not supposed to
talk to her but she’s a teacher,” and she goes on and on and on as they walk
out the door.
Jenny:​ About why it’s important to respect teachers.
Kristin: ​Right right. “Otherwise Buffy, chaos reigns!” Oh, I love Willow. I
love this moment.
Jenny:​ Right right. And then we get this great thing between Giles and
Jenny where he’s like “Mmmmm, hello.”
Kristin:​ This is incredible because-- Once again, and we talked about this a
little bit last week in “Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered” with the arc of
Xander and Cordelia and how in our memory, there was so many more
episodes of them having a relationship-Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ But really it’s just these powerful short scenes that make you feel
everything that I feel like it takes regular television shows ​many​ episodes to
get you to.
Jenny:​ It’s amazing, so much accomplished in so little time.
Kristin: ​Right. Jenny and Giles really haven’t spoken, there’s this moment


Jenny slips but not really slips and says that she’s in love with Giles, that she
wants things to be better. This moves Giles and Giles says, “You don’t have
to make it up to ​me,​ ” right? It’s Buffy.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ “You gotta make it-- I stand here with my faith tied to Buffy first
and so you have to make it up to her.” But essentially he’s like, “But I love
you too.” Right? I mean he doesn’t.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ He doesn't say that, but we get it. The music cues, the whole thing.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin: ​We’re there. I have a little crying smiley face. No, it’s not a smiley
face if it’s crying is it? [Jenny laughs] I have a crying sad face drawn in my
notebook.
Jenny:​ Yeah. Also I love how he’s like, “[imitating Giles] Mmmm, Angel has
regained his sense of whimsy ever since he lost his soul. I need a spell for
dis-invitation,” and she’s like, “oh, let me just pick up the first book on my
desk, the desk from which I teach computer class--’
Kristin:​ Right.
Jenny:​ “Here’s my spell book. Here’s my spell book that just happens to
have the spell you need.”
Kristin:​ Yeah, “Here’s my dusty ripped leather-bound book that doesn’t
seem at all out of place on my [Jenny laughs] computer science desk.”
Jenny:​ Listen, she doesn’t have to choose. She’s a techno-pagan.
Kristin: ​That’s true.
Jenny:​ Okay, she has a foot on either side of the threshold.


Kristin:​ Buffy you are… Oh my god, I just called you Buffy.
Jenny:​ ...What?
Kristin:​ I don’t know what happened.
Jenny:​ Wait.
Kristin:​ My brain…
Jenny:​ Am I flattered? I think I’m flattered.
Kristin:​ ​Jenny.​
Jenny:​ Go on.
Kristin:​ You are correct.
Jenny:​ Thank you.
Kristin: ​You are welcome. Also, I just realized I missed a note. It’s from
before the credits, do you mind?
Jenny:​ Please.
Kristin:​ I just wanted to make sure we all noticed that Buffy has a new
duvet cover, a new…
Jenny:​ Yeah a new sheet set.
Kristin:​ A whole new sheet set.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm. She went to JCPenny.
Kristin:​ Yeah, she got new stuff. And actually that ties into the next scene
that we were headed towards anyway which is that Buffy and Joyce are
having dinner together.
Jenny:​ Which is nice.


Kristin:​ Joyce is home from the art gallery at an early hour.
Jenny:​ For once.
Kristin:​ Perhaps we’re turning over a new leaf here.
Jenny:​ Working mothers ​can​ have it all.
Kristin:​ Joyce maybe purchased new linens for her daughter, is home,
they’re having dinner together, it’s very nice.
Jenny:​ And Buffy is like-- I mean, because she has to, but Buffy is opening
up to Joyce a little bit which I think Joyce is feeling.
Kristin:​ Yes, yes.
Jenny:​ And saying as much as she can about the situation and like, “Don’t
invite him in.”
Kristin:​ Right.
Jenny:​ “We were seeing each other but we’re not and he’s being a creep
and following me around.”
Kristin:​ Yeah and Joyce asking all the right mom questions like, “Has he
done anything to you?” Buffy of course lying completely, “No, of course it’s
not like that.” As soon as she said that, I was imagining a quick montage
[Jenny laughs] of all the times Angel has attached her and thrown her and
whatever.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ And then Joyce has this line to Buffy that-- this moment kind of
happens between them a few times. She says, “Don’t tell me. He’s changed.
He’s different.”
Jenny:​ Right.


Kristin:​ And she says it in this like “Mom Knows” and it kind of invalidates
the experience of the kid right? Like, “Oh okay. I’ve lived through this 40
times already because I’m your mother and I’m older than you, so I know.”
And it’s just extra heartbreaking here because Buffy can’t explain.
Jenny:​ Because of how right she is.
Kristin:​ Right. And that’s what this show does though right? Because even if
Buffy had been dating a regular dude who was not a vampire-Jenny:​ Hah!
Kristin:​ And that dude was really nice to her and then was a jerk to her and
her life wasn’t at risk, even if that was what was happening at this dinner
table, when your mom says to you, “Don’t tell me, he’s changed,” it just
makes you feel so small and you can’t communicate how you’re feeling-Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ Or you’re not being taken seriously. And this show compounds that
by being triply-- triply? Is that the Hell math here?
Jenny:​ Sure, yes.
Kristin:​ Three times?
Jenny:​ ​Yes.
Kristin:​ It’s three times as bad when your boyfriend was a vampire-- is a
vampire.
Jenny:​ [laughing] Yeah, that’s definitely the formula.
Kristin:​ [laughs] But I thought that this was a really interesting moment
and we see it again. We see it later when they have the talk which we’ll get
to…
Jenny:​ Right. But meanwhile, Buffy’s on the phone with Willow. They’re
both in their pajamas, Willow’s are fuzzy, Buffy’s are silk.


Kristin:​ Favorite line alert. Willow says, “Men can be such jerks sometimes.
Dead or alive.” [Jenny laughs] Thank you Willow for giving us our moment of
what Jenny?
Jenny:​ The patriarchy.
Kristin:​ Indeed.
Jenny:​ Wow so, they’re chatting about Angel and the horror and everything
and ooohh god, oh god. Willow’s trying to keep morale up, she’s like “Oh you
just got to think [slowly] positive…”
Kristin:​ Yeaaah.
Jenny:​ And then she finds an envelope at the foot of her bed and there’s
this great shot where the camera swings around-Kristin:​ ​Through​ the aquarium.
Jenny:​ Through her fish tank which is noticeably empty.
Kristin:​ Yes.
Jenny:​ And she pulls the fish which have been skewered on a line-- Of all
the sick, twisted…
Kristin:​ You know, you got to give Angel a little bit of credit.
Jenny:​ He’s very creative.
Kristin:​ It’s pretty… Yeah. He was like, “I’m going to put my charcoal down
for a moment and skewer these fish,” you know?
Jenny:​ Oh my god, oh my god.
Kristin:​ He also must have meticulously dried them off before putting them
in the envelope because the envelope is nice and dry.


Jenny:​ Yeah. Also, I feel he knows enough about Willow to know that would
hurt her-Kristin:​ Yes.
Jenny:​ Because I feel like fish are a less personal pet, like it wouldn’t hurt
everyone?
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ But Willow is a sensitive soul and he knows.
Kristin:​ And this cut, this cut-Jenny:​ Oh my god [laughs].
Kristin:​ It’s gotta be the best cut in the episode from Willow being terrified
to Willow sitting next to Buffy in bed.
Jenny:​ [high-pitched] “Thanks for having me over Buffy!”
Kristin:​ [laughing] Yes. It’s so good and I know last week I was like,
“Willow deserves a jingle, but I have to go to A Camp and we can’t get it
done,” I can’t make it through this episode. I forcefully said to Jenny, “I’m
sorry, we need to do it. We need to give Willow a jingle. She has earned it,
she’s earned it thrice over.”
Jenny:​ I’m a prisoner in my own home and here are the results.
[Willow’s jingle plays:
Who knows the square root of 1225? Willow!
Who’s gentle of heart, and nimble with a hard drive? Willow!
Willow, Willow, Willow.]
Kristin:​ Oh wow.
Jenny:​ Great great great.
Kristin:​ Wow wow wow. What a thing.


Jenny:​ Okay, so question.
Kristin:​ Yes.
Jenny:​ Why does she go to Bu-Kristin:​ Why does she go to Buffy’s house?
Jenny:​ Okay. I have a question and then some answers. Why does she go
to Buffy’s house? Why don’t they go Xander’s house where Angel has never
been invited inside?
Kristin:​ Right.
Jenny:​ Though of course the answer is- there’s no way to get Joyce out of
the house. Buffy needs to be with Joyce, she can’t just leave Joyce.
Kristin:​ Right, they can’t leave Joyce alone, exactly. You just worked
through that live on air.
Jenny:​ Ta-da!
Kristin:​ [laughs] This conversation between Buffy and Willow in bed after
we get through this hilarious opening moment is really important too. Buffy
has this line where she says, “It’s so weird, you know my first instinct is still
to always run to Angel.” And it brought to mind for me that this is a breakup
yeah, but it’s also like a death, essentially.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Angel has died and Angelus is in Angel’s place.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ And this moment where you forget and then you have to remember
again is just so vivid and captured. This is why the writing in this episode is
just brilliant.


Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ And then Willow has a line in this exchange as well where she says,
“You’re still the only thing he thinks about.”
Jenny:​ [grossed out] Burghhhh.
Kristin:​ And that’s what we were talking about at the beginning of the
episode, right?
Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ That Angel is… obsessed. He’s obsessed.
Jenny:​ In whatever way that manifests.
Kristin:​ Right. Buffy’s explanation to Joyce is pretty spot on. It’s missing
some details but he is off his hinges.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Speaking of off…
Jenny:​ [laughing] Yeah I was going to make the same transition!
Kristin:​ [laughing] Speaking of being off of your hinges, then we go to
[Jenny laughs] Drusilla.
Jenny:​ Drusilla has procured a succulent puppy [Kristin laughs] for Spike.
He’s named Sunshine.
Kristin:​ Sunshine!
Jenny:​ But he doesn’t want to eat it…
Kristin:​ Oh my god.
Jenny:​ He doesn’t want to be fed like a child.


Kristin: ​[laughing] Drusilla is…
Jenny:​ Is kind of making an airplane noise.
Kristin:​ Yes! We can’t not talk about the fact that not only is she trying to
feed Spike a puppy but that she’s like [makes an airplane noise] like you do
for a ​baby​. Which is very important to note because then Angel walks in-Jenny:​ Ugh. What a dick!
Kristin:​ I just have in all caps in my notes, “OH IN COMES ABLEIST
ANGEL!”
Jenny:​ Right?!
Kristin:​ He’s just going so hard on the ableist jokes. That is one of the
biggest places where they are like, “I know how to make Angel horrible!”
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ “We’ll make him as horrible as you can ever be to Spike in a
wheelchair,” right?
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ And he’s making joke after joke you know, “Oh I should take you
with me, I’d get a better parking space…”
Jenny:​ Boo.
Kristin:​ And then he takes it-- And this is when Spike loses it. He’s takes it
to a place where he’s essentially saying to Spike, “would you like me to have
sex with Drusilla for you? Oh I-- maybe I already am.”
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ “You don’t even know,” you know. This is really… something.
Jenny:​ [exhales angrily]


Kristin:​ And then Drusilla is not-Jenny:​ Is so into it!
Kristin:​ So into it.
Jenny:​ [imitates Drusilla] “I love when boys fight over me.”
Kristin:​ [laughs] But her moment of sheer joy is interrupted [Jenny laughs]
before it really even gets off the ground…
Jenny:​ [imitates Drusilla] “It makes a girl… ahhhhh!”
Kristin:​ [laughs hard] It’s so good.
Jenny:​ Just interrupted by her own vision.
Kristin:​ Interrupted by her vision. But she has this line that she says is
beautiful, “The air, it worries.” I just loved that.
Jenny:​ Yeah, it’s great [purrs].
Kristin:​ So she’s getting this... message from the ether, if you will.
Jenny:​ Uh huh, I will.
Kristin:​ That someone is trying to mess up her, as she calls it, “A happy
home.”
Jenny: ​Uhhhh…
Kristin:​ She has an interesting idea of what a happy home is.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ But yeah, that somebody is messing. And you know who’s messing
with it?


Jenny:​ Jenny Calendar!
Kristin:​ Jenny Calendar and her Italian friend [laughing].
Jenny:​ Is he Italian? He’s definitely from New York.
Kristin:​ He’s-- I mean…
Jenny:​ And he’s hawking Thesulan orbs in Sunnydale.
Kristin:​ Listen, I’m going to tell you something. We talk about stereotypes
on this show from time to time. As somebody who is half-Italian and who
has a lot of attachment to being Italian, I want to say that this show really
does kind of skirt into the land of, “Oh, it’s a guy and he’s doing something
under the table. He must be Italian!” Right?
Jenny:​ [laughs] Right, ‘cause we have Willy’s bar…
Kristin:​ Right.
Jenny:​ That guy was your neighbor on Long Island before you moved to-Kristin:​ Absolutely.
Jenny:​ And then this is your Uncle Vinny.
Kristin:​ This is for sure my Uncle Vinny.
Jenny:​ Running the magic shop.
Kristin:​ One hundred percent ‘cause all I was thinking about when this guy
is talking, the shop guy, was like, “Oh my god, I wonder what his Italian kids
think of him, right? What a funny thing to have an Italian dad who’s a
mobster but what his knowledge area is, is magic?”
Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ You know? It’s very interesting. So I know that maybe I should be
offended. My Italian sensibilities should be miffed. But instead, I love it. I’m


sorry, I just love it. I love the Italians that do the underground-- I like
Sunnydale’s version of the mob, you know? [laughs]
Jenny:​ Wow.
Kristin:​ Anyway.
Jenny:​ So Jenny buys a Thesulan orb from this man and on her way out of
the shop, he’s like, “What are you going to use it for?” And she’s like,
“[imitating Jenny] I’m going to get my friend a gift.” And he’s like, “What
kind of gift?” And she’s like, “[imitating Jenny] His soul.” It’s like would you
have that conversation with the Thesulan orb shopkeep?
Kristin:​ I don’t know, the guy…
Jenny:​ It’s a little sensitive.
Kristin:​ The guy is like…
Jenny:​ But he does invite a certain con-fi-dance.
Kristin:​ Exactly, I feel like I would have talked to him. He just seemed like a
guy you want to tell your secrets to before you leave.
Jenny:​ Yeah, totally.
Kristin:​ So I bought into that. I also just want to say before we leave with
Jenny and the Orb of Thesulah that I did enjoy this shop guy’s rhetoric of,
“You know, I’m sorry that I assumed that you weren’t here for something
serious, but at the end of the day, it’s the Ouija boards that pay my rent.”
So like-Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ He’s running-Jenny:​ He’s a realist.
Kristin:​ Right. He’s like, “I have to cater to the commercialization of my


passion here--”
Jenny:​ Right right.
Kristin:​ “It’s what put my daughter into college.”
Jenny:​ Dear lord.
Kristin:​ And on and on, so right. So Jenny leaves with the Orb of Thesulah.
The Orb of Thesulah is very interesting, it glows-Jenny:​ Whenever.
Kristin:​ Whenever it feels like it.
Jenny:​ When it senses a dramatic moment.
Kristin:​ [laughing] Yes.
Jenny:​ It’s like, “whoah, gotta go!”
Kristin:​ It’s like, “Hmm, it seems like we might be right about to go to
commercial, I should glow.”
Jenny:​ So after it glows, we go to school.
Kristin:​ We go to school. Fashion police here.
Jenny:​ Oh.
Kristin:​ Sorry, fashion police makes me sound like I’m gonna to be upset
with Xander for his outfit, but I’m not. I am thrilled.
Jenny:​ Oh my god, this is my favorite outfit that Xander has ever worn, I
want that sweater, I want those pants, I want the whole thing!
Kristin:​ Plaid pants-Jenny:​ Give it.


Kristin:​ A sweater with bright orange and green sleeves. It’s beautiful. I
wanna wear it myself. Xander, top outfit to date. We’ll see if you out-outfit
yourself in future episodes.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ But for now that’s the one. That is the one.
Jenny:​ Can we give the Sexual Tension Award to me and Xander’s outfit?
Kristin:​ No, you cannot put yourself-Jenny:​ I can’t get in there?
Kristin:​ I don’t know, it’s breaking the fourth wall, Jenny.
Jenny:​ Okay, sorry.
Kristin:​ I don’t know, I’ll think about it as we discuss.

[END AD BREAK]
Jenny:​ Okay so Buffy-- well Willow first sees Jenny Calendar booking it
across campus-Kristin:​ So sad.
Jenny:​ And she’s like, “Oh man, I don’t get to be the sub.” And then Buffy
runs over to her and is like, “Hey,” and Jenny’s like, “...Huh?”
Kristin:​ I love that moment, it’s great.
Jenny:​ Yeah, so good. So good.
Kristin:​ And then they have this exchange that’s very, very sweet.
Jenny:​ Oh my gosh, when she’s like, “He misses you.”
Kristin:​ Yes.
Jenny:​ Shout out to Robia LaMorte. Amazing teeny teeny tiny, the smallest
smile that has ever played across anyone’s face-Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ When Buffy says, “He misses you.”


Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ And then she gets back straight-faced.
Kristin:​ Right and this sentiment of-- Because Buffy comes on strong right?
She’s like, “You feel bad? Good, keep feeling bad.”
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ She’s definitely not giving Jenny an inch in terms of-Jenny:​ Right, like, “I’m still super fucking-- we are not okay but I want Giles
to be happy.”
Kristin:​ “But I love my dad and I want him to be happy!”
Jenny:​ Yeaaaaah!
Kristin:​ Oh god. Whoo, luckily we come out of this emotional moment by
seeing yet another beautiful outfit worn by Cordelia.
Jenny:​ Hah!
Kristin:​ She’s got this great magenta jacket with this yellow stripe on the
collar.
Jenny:​ Oh my god.
Kristin:​ I love it, I’m sorry.
Jenny:​ I’m so glad you love it.
Kristin:​ I just had a lot of fashion moments and I know we don’t-- We’re
missing Kate. Kate, we miss you.
Jenny:​ Yes.
Kristin:​ We miss you so bad.


Jenny:​ The pain is real.
Kristin:​ Kate will be with us on the next episode that happens though, live
from A Camp.
Jenny:​ Alright.
Kristin:​ We’ll talk about that more at the end. Anyhow, Cordelia’s jacket is
great.
Jenny:​ So this is the scene where they are de-Angelifying Willow’s room.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Right.
Jenny:​ They’re nailing up crosses, they’ve burned some herbs and sprinkled
holy water and chanted some rhyming couplets.
Kristin:​ Yes, as you do.
Jenny:​ Cordelia, Cordelia. [Kristin laughs] “Are you aware there are no fish
in your tank?” Cordelia.
Kristin:​ Oh and Willow’s little squeak. “Awww, my fish.”
Jenny:​ Awww god, she’s so sad. And then they’re like, “Cordelia, you can
leave,” and she’s like, “Cool, I’ll just turn to go. Oh, this must be for you.”
Kristin:​ This must be-Jenny:​ “This letter ​in your room​ must be for you.”
Kristin:​ Right and what’s weird is that it’s not for Willow, it’s for Buffy.
Jenny:​ Yeah, why would-- there’s questions.
Kristin:​ It’s just an interesting situation here.
Jenny:​ Just convenience.


Kristin:​ But that’s fine. It’s a good episode.
Jenny:​ Okay, so it’s a drawing of Joyce. And here is where I want to bring
up something.
Kristin:​ Yes.
Jenny:​ My friend Molly Green is a woman from Louisiana who was raised in
a classic Southern tradition to be a lady, right?
Kristin:​ Uh huh.
Jenny:​ And one of her lady traits [Kristin laughs] is that she has signature
stationery that she uses for Thank You notes and How Do You Do notes and
whatever. She uses the same stationery all the time.
Kristin:​ Right.
Jenny:​ She picked a pattern-Kristin:​ Wow.
Jenny:​ From Crane, and that’s what she always uses. What I want to draw
attention to here, is that Angel seems to have a similar thing going. He went
somewhere and got some stationery! [Kristin laughs], this sort of linen-y,
natural, colored paper that he loves to trifold and then put in a business
sized envelope.
Kristin:​ Yes. It’s very specific.
Jenny:​ I just [pauses] want to draw attention to this.
Kristin:​ I mean you know, Angel, he’s doing a good job of being a weird-Jenny:​ A creep?


Kristin:​ Creep, old vampire dude-Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ That’s evil, that’s all.
Jenny:​ Well, how long do you think he’s had that specific stationery thing
going on?
Kristin:​ Oh for-Jenny:​ Do you think that it predates him having his soul back?
Kristin:​ Yeah, I think that Drusilla got those same notes.
Jenny:​ Mmmmm.
Kristin:​ I think that’s what we are to believe here. That he has had that
paper-- [Jenny laughs] He keeps it somewhere safe where the air cannot
yellow it.
Jenny:​ Right, further.
Kristin:​ Yeah or maybe it’s just part of the underground commerce that,
they know-Jenny:​ Oh, right. Vamp stationery.
Kristin:​ “If you don’t keep Angel’s stationery in stock, you’re going to die.”
Jenny:​ Right, that makes sense.
Kristin:​ So you gotta keep it coming.
Jenny:​ So we cut from the reveal of this drawing to Joyce.
Kristin:​ And we cut from the reveal of this picture of Joyce with one word
from Buffy. She just looks at it and says, “Mom.”


Jenny:​ [sadly] Aww.
Kristin:​ And I think that that is very important and very powerful. It’s just
drawing our attention to the fact that this ​is her mother.​ This is her family,
this is her whole family, right?
Jenny:​ Yeah. For practical purposes.
Kristin:​ I mean, she has a dad somewhere but he’s not in the picture. This
is her everything when it comes to family.
Jenny:​ So Joyce’s headlights come around the corner and pull into the
driveway and illuminate [pauses] none other than Angelus.
Kristin:​ The crazy boyfriend and oh how he is... he plays... I mean shout
out to David Boreanaz in this scene. He nails this character.
Jenny:​ Yeah, this unhinged ex-boyfriend thing [purrs].
Kristin:​ Yeah, and Joyce. Huge shout out to Joyce okay, for this moment.
The first line out of her mouth? “She told me she wants you to leave her
alone.”
Jenny:​ Yeah, hell yeah.
Kristin:​ She doesn’t fucking hesitate. She’s like, “Uh, that’s my kid. So fuck
off and step off Angel.”
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ “I’m not afraid of you,” except she is.
Jenny:​ And he’s got just this rolling barrage of creepy lines. “I need to be
with her.”
Kristin:​ Yes.
Jenny:​ “You can convince her for me.”


Kristin:​ She drops her bag of fruit…
Jenny:​ Ughhh.
Kristin:​ And Angel is picking it up and this is I think-Jenny:​ Please note that the first thing he picks up just flies out of his hand
offscreen.
Kristin:​ Right and I’m sure that this was not a, meant to happen moment,
which I think is really powerful. I don’t think that Angel was-- I think that
the direction was, “Hey David, you’re going to put the oranges in the bag
and be a creep about it.” I think that he dropped the orange and Kristine
Sutherland looks at it, realizes she’s in danger, she can’t go after the
orange, the orange is inconsequential-Jenny:​ Uh huh.
Kristin:​ And she stays there. And I think that that was-- We may never
know but I think that that was just a moment that happened when the scene
was being taken for whatever time and they kept this cut.
Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ And it’s brilliant. Then Joyce… too many art gallery keys man.
Jenny:​ Too many art gallery keys. Also Angel drops the bomb that he and
Buffy “made love”.
Kristin:​ Right, Joyce is fumbling with all of her one million keys [Jenny
laughs] and Angel delivers one of the most horrible lines of all time. “Ever
since the night that we made love,” he says. And I’m sorry, if I were Buffy
I’d be like, “He’s unhinged, that was a lie.” I feel like you could get away
with it, you know.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ I feel like Mom would maybe believe that this person who is
obviously completely unhinged is just making up lies to get to her. But she


doesn’t so it winds up that Joyce and Buffy have what Joyce refers to as “the
talk” although I always thought the talk was where you learned what sex
was, not where…
Jenny:​ Not that somebody had already had sex.
Kristin:​ Right and you’re like, “well, shit.”
Jenny:​ Maybe there’s more than one talk?
Kristin:​ Maybe there is. But this scene between Joyce and Buffy with the
sex conversation is powerful in the same way that I think the dinner
conversation was powerful.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Where Joyce can’t know and so Joyce is saying things to Buffy that
like, could you have a sharper dagger than, “I really thought you’d make a
better decision.”
Jenny:​ [sadly] Ugh!
Kristin:​ Ugh, my god.
Jenny:​ Joyce you don’t know!
Kristin:​ Joyce, I mean she doesn’t and she’s just trying to be a good parent
and she’s-- Really, I think that Joyce is doing a good job of setting
boundaries and saying I care-- you know, “no matter how much you shut
me out” ‘cause Joyce is suffering this fate of being shut out by her teenage
daughter, a common fate of parents of teenagers. But also so much more so
because of Buffy’s secret and the fact that Buffy can’t tell her anything. So I
think Joyce does a decent job in this but it’s just a very difficult thing overall
and Buffy, if I were you, I would have said, “[mockingly] He’s crazy, I don’t
know what he means [Jenny laughs] I’ve never had sex in my whole life.”
Jenny:​ Yeah, what is sex? We didn’t even have the talk yet.
Kristin:​ Right.


Jenny:​ I don’t know how to do it. Okay, so Giles swings by the computer
lab.
Kristin:​ He does and this is another-Jenny:​ Oh man!
Kristin:​ Jenny, I really like this moment for Jenny Calendar where there’s a
lot going on. She’s trying to restore Angel’s soul, trying to get back with
Giles.
Jenny:​ Trying to get back in Buffy’s good graces.
Kristin:​ Trying to get back in Buffy’s good graces and the first thing she
says is, “She said you missed me.” [They both laugh] It’s just really good.
Jenny:​ With just the right delivery.
Kristin:​ Yeah, she really does a good job in this moment.
Jenny:​ And I love the way Giles responds, “Well she’s… [pauses] a
meddlesome girl.”
Kristin:​ She’s a meddlesome girl and they have this really sweet moment
and they’re on the path to you know, coming back together again and
Jenny’s like, “You know, I have some things to take care of here. I don’t
want to get you excited yet but I think I might have good news.”
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ And Giles says, “Come by my house later.” Huge deal. This is a
huge deal.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ It’s impossible to talk about this as though I don’t know what
happens, you know?


Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Like “[high-pitched] This is a great thing!” And inside, my heart is
shattered into eighty million pieces.
Jenny:​ Yeah, yeah yeah.
Kristin:​ Because of course, ‘Enter All Ye Who Seek Knowledge’ has foiled us.
Angel is in the school, I mean Angel’s been in the school a thousand times
so we knew Angel could get in the school.
Jenny:​ Yeah I mean I have to imagine that a ​public​ school building…
Kristin:​ And this is probably a building that cannot be protected then
because everytime you would cast the spell, the sign would still be there.
Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ Like if the sign is there, it probably just undoes the protection.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ So Angel-- there’s a beautiful shot of this reveal of Angel being in
the room where Jenny has translated the text that she needs to make the
Orb of Thesulah work.
Jenny:​ Yeah, she begins to print out all of the text [Kristin laughs] on the
world’s first printer.
Kristin:​ Those printers, shout out to those printers that had to be-- where
the paper had to be pulled up by its holes.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ To make it…
Jenny:​ Those were the days.
Kristin:​ I love that, then you’d have that satisfying fold where you’d fold the


edges and tear them off.
Jenny:​ Oh my god yeah. Do you remember the ones that had light green
stripes alternating with white stripes?
Kristin:​ Yeees, of course.
Jenny:​ Ugh!!
Kristin:​ Just very satisfy-- I would love a printer like that. Nobody send me
that printer to our PO box.
Jenny:​ Please don’t.
Kristin:​ I don’t actually want it. [laughs] So the camera kind of focuses in
on this printer and it’s out of focus as it pans up and the focus becomes on
Angel.
Jenny: ​Right. And this is just sooo this show, right?
Kristin:​ Mmhmm.
Jenny:​ Like here’s some hope! Oh my gosh, things might be ok-- no. No.
Kristin:​ You say that, you say that…
Jenny:​ No.
Kristin:​ I mean yes, in arc of emotion, this is so this show. But in what
happens, this is not this show.
Jenny:​ Noo, no.
Kristin:​ This is way off the rails for this show where this goes. It’s taking us
for the first time to a place where we know no one is safe, right?
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Jenny Calendar is one of the Scooby gang, she’s a core character up


until this point…
Jenny:​ She’s in love with Giles.
Kristin:​ She’s in love with Giles, she is important to the overall plot line, we
have gotten attached to her and more importantly, as I said in the
beginning, ​Giles​ has gotten attached to her and we are attached to Giles.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ And this scene… Now to bring a little bit of beautiful glory [Jenny
laughs] into this horrible scene, I just really want to say that if I were the
actor playing Jenny Calendar and I found out that I was being killed off, I
would be very upset. However if I learned that this last scene that I would
get to film was going to be the classic, beautifully shot, girl-running-away
from evil thing through the hallways…
Jenny:​ Yeah, forever and ever.
Kristin:​ I mean I’m not an actor anymore, but if I could pick any kind of
scene I would want to play, it would be this scene. And it’s shot beautifully.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ She’s running through the hallways through the shadows, there’s
doors that are locked, there’s doors that are open, it’s just-- there’s a panic
to the whole thing.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ It’s just beautifully done. And you think, I mean thinking back to
watching this episode for the first time, you’re like. ‘Of course she’s going to
get away.’ I mean I cannot imagine being a viewer of this show-Jenny:​ Oh my god.
Kristin:​ On first watch and having no idea what’s about to happen because
you really are just not-- you don’t think it’s going to happen because it’s
never happened before. And they take this scene, right? There’s one little


silly moment if we just wanna…
Jenny:​ [high-pitched] Uhh… let me just run directly at this janitor cart even
though you are clearly telegraphing that you are about to push it at me.
Kristin:​ I just-- [laughing]
Jenny:​ Wouldn’t it be fun if I toppled over this janitor cart before I kill you?
Kristin:​ I just think maybe Angel’s reflexes ​might​ get him over the janitor
cart. Just maybe.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Just going to put that-- whatever. The scene is a beautiful scene
and it ends at this gorgeous window.
Jenny:​ Oh yeah.
Kristin:​ They’re framed in the window and Angel-Jenny:​ Somehow he has magically gotten ahead of her.
Kristin:​ I mean… he’s a vamp-- that’s why the cart scene is a little silly.
Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ Because he’s quick, he’s powerful, he’s incredibly strong, he’s one
of the strongest vampires that exist.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ And he’s up by this window and he set this up in the beginning. You
know what? Something I want to talk about too is how do you throw a
computer on the ground and make it start on fire? I just, is it something in
1990s computers that could make it start on fire? Is it a spark from the--- it
just seems very complicated.
Jenny:​ What I’d say is that while I don’t have the logical explanation for


how a huge desktop computer just magically catches on fire when you dump
it on the ground…
Kristin:​ Right.
Jenny:​ What I will say is that I didn’t blink. I was like ‘Of course that’s what
happens!’
Kristin:​ Right, right [laughs]. And so I bring it up because Angel, it does set
Angel up for this very nice shot where he’s warming his hands over the fire.
Jenny:​ Right, after he has-Kristin:​ After he’s burned the translation that Jenny needs.
Jenny:​ Right, smashed the orb.
Kristin:​ The orb smash is incredible…
Jenny:​ Trash the computer, it’s a whole thing.
Kristin:​ He says he’s killed two birds with one stone and then he looks up in
vamp face and says, “And teacher makes three.”
Jenny:​ Blah…
Kristin:​ And that’s what I wanted to bring into this scene by the window
because he’s so… cavalier, you know? He’s just so calm, so whatever. He
gets there and you just don’t expe-- I mean, you don’t expect this. You
expect Buffy, of course, Buffy is going to jump through something-Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ And get him and kill him and something! And she doesn’t. Nobody’s
there. And he just snaps her neck.
Jenny:​ He doesn’t even…
Kristin:​ He doesn’t even bite her. He doesn’t even bite her. He just snaps


her neck and drops her to the ground. And then we cut to what would have
been a commercial and I just can’t imagine.
Jenny:​ Ugh.
Kristin:​ I mean I’ve said it. We had to watch this episode twice and I hope
that you all are impressed with us or feel bad for us or something because…
Jenny:​ It’s hard.
Kristin:​ It’s just very hard to watch and I just couldn’t imagine having been
a part of this show when it was airing live. I just feel like everyone must
have ran immediately to their computers and gone on message boards and
just sought out some sort of community like, “Can you believe that this has
happened?’ But it has.
Jenny:​ The next thing that we see is Giles swinging by the Summers
household to pick up his book so that he can go home and cast a
de-invitation spell. Okay first of all, everybody, do you think that we could
have gotten this done while it was still daylight? Things would be different.
Also, you need to hand the book off? Giles works in the library where I
assume there must be a Xerox machine and if there’s not, there’s one in the
teacher’s lounge. Bro!
Kristin:​ Right.
Jenny:​ Get on your game!
Kristin:​ Right, right.
Jenny:​ What are we doing?!
Kristin:​ But you know why we need Giles to come pick up the book?
Jenny:​ Hah, I do.
Kristin:​ It’s so that we can have-- And thank god you know. I think the
writers know they have just delivered a pretty crushing blow.


Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ They’re about to deliver a way worse one. Screw you writers.
[Jenny giggles] But before they do, they give us this moment of relief with
Giles and Willow having this delightful exchange [Jenny laughs] where Joyce
has found out about Buffy and Angel and I just want to listen to this
together because it’s just too delightful.
[Audio clip plays]
Willow: ​Oh yeah, it went fine. Well, it went fine until Angel showed up
and told Buffy’s mom that he and Buffy had… well, you know… That
they had… you know… You do know right?
Giles: ​Oh yes, yes. Sorry.
Willow: ​Oh good, ‘cause I just realized that being a librarian and all,
you maybe didn’t know.
Giles: ​No, thank you. I got it.
Kristin:​ [They both laughs] You know, I just really…
Jenny:​ “Being a librarian and all.”
Kristin:​ Yeah [laughs].
Jenny:​ So great.
Kristin:​ So we’ve already discussed Joyce and Buffy talking about sex and
Angel and all of that, and the scene that comes after this scene, my only
notes for it are that I’ve written the word ‘No’ about twenty times in my
notebook. This is… I mean this scene has to be one of the most devastating
scenes in the series.
Jenny:​ It’s so twisted.
Kristin: ​It’s so upsetting. Early, early, early on in the podcast I had tweeted
something and I used the GIF of Giles smelling the rose. I hadn’t put it
together, I’ve only seen the series once up until this point.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.


Kristin:​ And I just didn’t think about it and like 40 people replied. They were
like ‘[high-pitched] How dare you use this GIF?!’ [they both laugh] And now
I remember. I just, it’s-Jenny:​ Ugh.
Kristin:​ So there’s the rose on the doorway, he walks in. Obviously
everything is set up.
Jenny:​ Champagne on ice. Candles. Puccini.
Kristin:​ Yeah, a note trifolded that just says ‘Upstairs’. Candles leading up
the stairs. And he takes the bottle of wine and a glass up and he’s just so
excited and in this way that’s so sweet and so full of love and you know-Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ And we all know what’s going to happen.
Jenny:​ Ugh.
Kristin:​ And he crests the staircase and this is-- I mean, this series deals
with grief I think in the most brilliant ways and the most truthful, horrific,
accurate ways. We see Giles’s face expectant, excited to see Jenny, to find
Jenny. And then this shift, I mean Anthony Stewart Head, this is brilliant
acting on his part as well, this shift from that excitement to this horrific
realization. And then the edit goes from that moment of realization right to
just emptiness and shock and we see the police lights outside.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ It just captures these stages of grief in again, what is maybe, 10
seconds? Maybe 10 seconds?
Jenny:​ Yeah. And then the police officer informs Giles he’s going to need to
come down to the station. Giles says, “I need to make a phone call first.” He
calls Buffy to tell Buffy what’s going on and Angel…
Kristin:​ Angel makes a brief appearance to narrate during the police scene,


I will say. Shout out to Angel. You know Angel had a lot to do in this
episode.
Jenny:​ Busy guy.
Kristin:​ He had to draw charcoal, he had to skewer fish, he had to stock up
on stationery, and he had to do a whole V.O. A whole thing. A whole
situation.
Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ But yeah. He makes this phone call, Giles does. And this is, you
know you just keep thinking, “Well okay, this is as sick and twisted as it
could get.”
Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ And it just keeps getting more sick and twisted.
Jenny:​ Yep.
Kristin:​ Because Angel is now after setting up this elaborate thing, he has
run, scurried over to Buffy’s house-Jenny:​ Ugh.
Kristin:​ Because he knows that Giles will call them to tell them and he
knows that they will be devastated and he wants to watch. He wants to
watch this happen-Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ And he does. The scenes through the dining room window I think
are some of the more powerful moments that we get in the series-Jenny:​ Yeah, they’re beautiful.
Kristin:​ And we’ve had a couple already and this is another. Through the
curtains, we see the phone call silently happen.


Jenny:​ Right and we see two very different manifestations of grief and
shock.
Kristin:​ Yes.
Jenny:​ In Buffy and Willow.
Kristin:​ Buffy slides down the wall and just sort of puts her head down and
Willow-- dear god.
Jenny:​ So good at crying.
Kristin:​ Ugh, this cry, it’s like how can a person make me feel so many
feelings? Willow in just a half a second of a little squeak, I just lose it with
her. And then…
Jenny:​ Wait, wait. What did Giles’s phone call interrupt them doing? They
are walking side by side in what appears to be [Kristin laughs] just laps
around the bottom floor of the Summers house. Just two ladies walking
through the house side by side.
Kristin:​ Maybe they’re casting. Maybe they’re still casting. Maybe they’re
doing extra spells.
Jenny:​ Ooookay.
Kristin:​ That would be a thing that would make two ladies walk around the
house together.
Jenny:​ Sure, yes. Totally.
Kristin:​ But something that I wanted to talk about too in this arc of grief as
I’ll call it, because I think that… you’ve lost people in your life Jenny, I’ve
lost people in my life, and I think that there are very particular things that
happen when you lose someone, where someone is lost. Whether that
person is close to you or not, if they’re in your orbit-Jenny:​ Mmhmm.


Kristin:​ There’s the grief that you have, but then there is the coming
together of the people closest to you. And the people that come together
aren’t even necessarily always the people that you see the most. It’s just all
of a sudden, the people that matter the most are there, and there’s no
words spoken, and you’re just doing what has to get done. And so the scene
that happens right after this phone call shatters my heart because it’s
Cordelia and Xander in the car picking up Willow and Buffy to go over to
Giles’s house. I have the chills even talking about it.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ Because I’ve been there too of just, you become a different person.
Anything that has mattered to you up until that point, it disappears. Because
you realize suddenly, I mean we’re human so we walk through the earth
thinking that things are important. And they’re not. And it takes these
moments to realize, “Oh right, that isn’t even the world. That isn’t even the
reality.”
Jenny: ​Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ This is the reality, this is what’s important and that’s where they
find themselves in this moment. They’re in the car and they go to Giles’s
house together and my heart. My heart, my heart.
Jenny:​ Yeah, but Giles is not there because he has already loaded up on
weapons and exited quickly past one more charcoal drawing, this one of
Jenny Calendar indicating that not only is Angel a convincing and talented
artist, he’s also pretty fast.
Kristin:​ Yeah. He works quickly.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ Giles has packed up all his weapons. Xander and Cordelia have this,
I think a very fun little moment with the weapons, where we learn that Giles
only keeps his regular weapons [Jenny laughs] at the school, but he keeps
his for-company show-off weapons at his own home.


Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ But he’s taken them all and Xander, I think Xander has a really
interesting little moment here, because Xander does something that I think
annoyed me on first watch. He gives this, “I’ve been telling you people to kill
him,” and it’s like, “Xander, not now.” But I watched the scene a little bit
more closely this time, and they really put a focus on Xander really aching
for Giles right when he walks in.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ And that arc really takes him to this place where he’s fucking mad.
He’s just so mad and it’s another manifestation of grief, right? We don’t say
the right things all the time, we get angry, we say exactly what we’re feeling
and that’s what Xander is doing like, “I fucking told you to kill this thing.”
He’s not thinking about Buffy’s feelings and what’s remarkable is that Buffy’s
not thinking about Buffy’s feelings either-Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Because as soon as Xander says that, she says, “You’re right.”
Jenny:​ Yeah. So intense. I can’t talk because I have too many body chills.
Kristin:​ Well, this is a nice moment to transition to as we have a lot of body
chills and feelings. Because we take all of our body chills and emotional
feelings over to the lair or whatever we’re calling it, Spike’s house.
Jenny:​ [laughs] The factory.
Kristin:​ And Spike and Dru and Angel are batting each other around…
Jenny:​ Just having another lovers’ spat.
Kristin:​ Like they do and you know, Spike is like, “You could’ve killed her,
you’re really pissing me off.” And Angel’s like, “[caveman grunts] Meh meh
meh.” And then-Jenny:​ Sorry, what is Angel like?


Kristin:​ “[caveman grunts] Meh meh meh.” [Jenny laughs] And then Angel
is interrupted by a firebomb [Jenny laughs] thrown by Giles.
Jenny:​ Hell yeah!
Kristin:​ Hell yes. The only thing sexier than Librarian Giles is Firebombing
Giles.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ He drops a firebomb down on them. Angel is immediately like,
“Whoa, shit!” and Dru and Spike are like, “You better deal with this shit that
you did.” They help Angel not at all.
Jenny:​ Yeah. Especially Spike. Dru almost gets involved and Spike grabs
her and is like “Yee-- don’t get involved unless he tags you in.”
Kristin:​ Right, unless he tags you in. Giles meanwhile is picking up a giant
stick fire that he’s beating Angel over the head with.
Jenny:​ Yes, relentlessly.
Kristin:​ Relentlessly. This is great. Another stage of grief, right?
Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ I mean really being played out here for us. And Giles is having a
pretty good time, he’s doing well…
Jenny:​ But then things turn…
Kristin:​ Yes.
Jenny:​ And Angel gets him by the throat and he’s like, “You’ve had your
fun.”
Kristin:​ Right.


Jenny:​ “Now it’s time for…” Buffy’s fun!
Kristin:​ And then finally we get the moment that we thought was going to
happen for Jenny but now happens (thank god) for Giles.
Jenny:​ Yeah. Buffy kicks Angel in the face so many times.
Kristin:​ So many times. It’s a great fight scene. Giles fall-- knockout.
Knockout for Giles-Jenny:​ Ohhh.
Kristin:​ If you’re keeping track, Giles is down. Buffy and Angel have this
incredible fight scene.
Jenny:​ Oh my god.
Kristin:​ On the rafters?
Jenny:​ When they get up on that catwalk and she wraps a rope around him
and rings him like a bell! Hell yeah.
Kristin:​ She bangs him into every side of the walkway and then-- then
something very interesting happens which I think fits this theme of Angel
being twisted and having a larger plan because she’s kicking the shit out of
him. Angel’s laughing hysterically through the whole thing.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Totally nonplussed and then he says, “You’re going to let your old
man burn?” And Buffy has this moment of, “oh shit, Giles.” Looks down,
Giles is surrounded by flames and Angel picks her up over the catwalk to
drop her down to go get Giles, like it’s not a fight move at all. At first watch,
I thought, “Oh, he’s fighting,” but he’s not. He walks away. He’s not in
danger at all, he’s not hurt at all, he’s laughing hysterically.
Jenny:​ Oh god.
Kristin:​ I mean the fire is there, but it just seems like what’s happening


here is he’s like, “I still have more to do with you. I still want to play with
you more. Go rescue your old man ‘cause I’m in power.” Right? Like that’s
what this moment is and it’s terrifying.
Jenny:​ Oh it’s so twisted. Then Buffy gets Giles outside.
Kristin:​ This…
Jenny:​ And he is [pauses] so mad.
Kristin:​ This moment between Giles and Buffy is another heart wrenching
moment and another, really for me, very accurate, very moving moment. I
had the experience of almost losing my mom. My mom, when I was 21, 22,
she got really really sick and without going into too much detail, was in ICU.
We all said our goodbyes to her and she somehow turned around and pulled
out of it and that’s a very quick summary of a story that I’ll probably pull out
even larger in future episodes.
But for now, what I want to talk about is the fact that at the time, I was 21,
22, and I was dating someone very seriously for the first time in my life and
as I talked about with the Scoobies earlier, she was there with me. You
know, the people that are closest to you, they just come. You drop
everything. She was there for me when I was saying goodbye to my mom
and I remember because I was dating her, you know we were very
emotionally close, and we got in this horrible fight at my house. Just this
horrible fight and we were screaming and screaming and screaming and I
don’t even know how it happened but somehow we ended up on the ground
rolling around and it went from this moment of screaming and rolling around
to hysterical sobbing.
It’s a moment I’ll never forget, and it’s a moment that is paralleled here. The
exact response happens between the two of them right? Buffy knocks-- I
mean Buffy’s the Slayer so she knocks Giles out. I didn’t knock my girlfriend
out, I didn’t hit my girlfriend, nobody panic. But they’re fighting, she hits
Giles and that hit that takes him down, opens him up, right?
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ It’s like the anger that he had and the anger that she had, she--


“You almost died, I need you, you can’t leave me.” And suddenly they’re
there and they’re grieving in the alleyway and it’s just… It’s just beautiful
and heartbreaking.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm. And then we go to the cemetery for a rare daylight
scene-Kristin:​ Mmmm.
Jenny:​ In which Giles is laying flowers on Jenny’s grave. Question!
Kristin:​ Yeah, call out on…
Jenny:​ Her name is Janna Kalderash, why does her tombstone say Jenny
Calendar?!
Kristin:​ Right, this is an interesting choice because I think it also would
have been-- first of all, it would have been accurate. But it also would have
been more emotionally powerful for the headstone to have said her real
name, right? There’s just so much more in that than us seeing Jenny
Calendar but…
Jenny:​ Right, it’s probably just like a show shortcut like, “we need to make
sure that you know who this is.”
Kristin:​ Right. But I don’t know. I guess at this point, they didn’t
understand the true depth of their audience and how much they would
understand.
Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ But Angel the narrator is back.
Jenny:​ Right, but you know what else is here sonically? A beautiful piece-Kristin:​ Oh right.
Jenny:​ Composed by Christophe Beck called “Remembering Jenny”. You can
hear Anthony Stewart Head singing the “uhhhs”, right?


Kristin:​ Mmhmm.
Jenny:​ So listen for that. And also, it’s important for us to note that that
song was sampled by Ed Sheeran!
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ For the song “Afire Love”.
Kristin:​ Ed Sheeran, a huge “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” fan. We just found
this out because of this episode so-Jenny:​ Ed, we’re ready for you!
Kristin:​ We’re ready for you whenever Ed! You want to come co-write a
song with us, any time man!
Jenny:​ Yeah, come on down.
Kristin:​ So Angel the narrator is back and delivers I think a really important
line for us: “If we could live without passion, maybe we would find peace.
But we’d be hollow.”
Jenny:​ Woof.
Kristin:​ Woof indeed. Something that I think is part of the human condition,
right?
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ We struggle, we struggle, we struggle, we struggle. We want not to
struggle, but without that, without the passion that causes those struggles,
we would also lose all of the beauty-Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ And we would be empty. So we have to mourn, right?


Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ We have to lose things that we love and this, as we said at the
beginning, this applies to everyone on the show including Angel even though
he is soulless.
Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ There is passion driving him.
Jenny:​ And Buffy…
Kristin:​ Yes.
Jenny:​ For her part is telling Giles, “I wasn’t ready, but I’m ready now
because I know that nothing is going to bring him back.” As as she says
that…
Kristin:​ Yes.
Jenny:​ We see a floppy disk! For those of you who don’t know what a floppy
disk is.
Kristin:​ Pivotal-- one of many moments in the 90s where a pivotal plot
point hinged on a floppy disk.
Jenny:​ Yes [They both laugh]. We see the floppy disk that Jenny had saved
all of her translation work on-Kristin:​ Right.
Jenny:​ In terms of getting Angel’s soul back, fall off of the desk and down
into a crack between the desk and a filing cabinet or something. And
seriously, if you missed floppy disks because of when you were born, that’s
how we used to store information.
Kristin:​ Think of it like a hard drive.
Jenny:​ Yeah, like a teeny teeny teeny tiny hard drive.


Kristin:​ A flat little hard drive that can hold about 1/87th-Jenny:​ One Word document.
Kristin:​ Yeah, [laughing] one Word document at a time. And it’s important
too I think, before we wrap up here, to just talk about the fact that what is
on that floppy disk is the translation of this text that is used for the Orb of
Thesulah and that is an open thing. That what we learned about the Orb of
Thesulah is that it will pull someone’s soul from the ether.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ And it will contain it until it is ready to be transferred. Because
when we watched this scene the second time, I was like, “Why isn’t Jenny
just reading the text?” And then I sort of listened a little bit more closely and
I was like, “Oh, there’s actually a lot to this ritual.”
Jenny:​ Many steps.
Kristin:​ There’s a lot that has to happen. And with all of that said Jenny, we
haven’t awarded a Sexual Tension Award to anybody. So, I wonder…
Jenny:​ I already made my nomination.
Kristin:​ You stand firm on your nomination. I mean, I’m thinking through it,
I’m thinking through it, there’s some Throuple moments but we’ve already
awarded it to the Throuple. There’s Sunshine the puppy-Jenny:​ Mmmm.
Kristin:​ That’s weird. So, I think-- yeah. I think we can give it to you. The
Sexual Tension Award for the first time ever, going to Jenny Owen Youngs
[Jenny gasps] and Xander Harris’s orange and green sweater…
Jenny:​ And plaid pants. The ensemble.
Kristin:​ Oh, the whole ensemble. Just take Xander out of it.


Jenny:​ Yes.
Kristin:​ Please take Xander out of it.
Jenny:​ Wow, this is so unexpected. I would like to thank [Kristin laughs] the
Academy and all of our listeners.
Kristin:​ I guess we’ll finally know if the awards really come in the mail now.
Jenny:​ [laughs] Hooray!
Kristin:​ Well I think that about does it for this very sad, horribly sad,
endlessly sad episode and I think we did a good job bringing some levity to
the situation, don’t you?
Jenny:​ Yes I do. So I am ​still​ remarkably Jenny Owen Youngs-Kristin:​ Award-winning.
Jenny:​ Yes, award-winning Jenny Owen Youngs and when I’m not watching
Buffy, I’m usually writing songs and recording them. You can learn more

tune of ‘Old Macdonald Had a Farm’] And on this farm, they had a Kristin.

inspires is [Jenny gasps] just a reimagined version of

Wait for me
To go back to sleep
What I wish I could do
Dream a world where you’re still you
I can feel the ground underneath me crack
Silent as the light sky fades to black
Now I know that you’re never coming back
To me
What I love, what I need
Gone so far away from me
Look too close and I blur
Can’t fill the hole where you were
I can feel the ground underneath me crack
Silent as the light sky fades to black
Now I know that you’re never coming back
To me
To me
