Buffering the Vampire Slayer
Episode 7.07: Conversations with Dead People
[CHIME]
Jenny: Oh, hey everybody!
Kristin: Hello, everybody!
Jenny: Uh, before we get into the episode, we have some things to tell you.
Kristin: Yes. Perhaps the most exciting thing we have to tell you is that we know a lot of you have been waiting to find out if we’re going to be able to get virtual tickets to either Friday or Saturday night of Buffy Prom. We are very excited to tell you that we’re partnering with Moment House and we’re streaming the Friday night event. It is called Celebrating 25 Years of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, from Sunnydale High School. We are so excited. It is March 11th, 2022. Virtual tickets will go on sale today at 1PM Eastern time. Today, Wednesday, [Jenny gasps] 1PM Eastern time. And you can find them at momenthouse.com/bufferingthevampireslayer.
Jenny: Woo-oo! On that very Friday night, we’re gonna have live music from me, special guests including our nemeses-ses [Kristin laughs], Morgan and LaToya from Angel On Top, and Evan Ross Katz, who is soon to release his Buffy-themed book. We will all be together at Torrance High School, AKA Sunnydale High. Do we have graduation robes already? Maybe! Do we have letterman jackets already? It is possible!
Kristin: Very possible! Los Angeles-based folks, there are still about 40 tickets left to the in-person event. A note to those of you who already have tickets to Friday or
Saturday night: we know that for a lot of you, it’s the first time you’re gonna be attending an in-person event in these Covid times, and we know that it can be really daunting. So know please that ticket-holders are gonna get an email in the next week as we start gathering proof of vaccination. We specifically capped attendance at Friday’s event to leave 350 empty seats in the theater, so that there can be space between folks. Both events will be masked. Saturday’s event is entirely outdoors. And all of the information, as we have it, can be found at bufferingthevampireslayer.com/PromSafety. If you just go to Prom, you can find all the details of the event. Also, we know that some of you are like, "But Saturday, Saturday! Why is Saturday not a virtual event?" And we hope that in years forward, it can be. It’s just that Prom, if you’ve been to it or if you’ve heard of it, there’s a lot of dancing, there’s a lot of music, there’s a lot of movement. And so producing that event to stream it was really complicated. And we wanna make sure that when we have you purchasing a ticket to a live Prom, that we are giving you an experience that rules. You know how we do things over here. We’re only gonna let you come if it’s gonna rule! And we’re not sure that we could have made it rule this year, on Saturday night, virtually. [laughs] But Friday night is gonna rule!
Jenny: Um. Speaking of a segue I have failed to thread [Kristin laughs] into this little transition, it’s time for the results from last episode’s Sexual Tension Awards.
Kristin: You could have said—
Jenny: Him!
Kristin: "Speaking of complicated production."
Jenny: I…[both laugh] yeah. The episode was Him. The star was a varsity jacket. [both laugh] And here is how the 611 votes that you cast on our Twitter poll fell. In fourth place, [both laughing] so sad. In fourth place, with a paltry 1% of the vote, it’s Lori and R.J.
Kristin: I’m sorry, Lori. [laughs]
Jenny: Oh, dear. In second [sic] place, oh no! She can’t catch a break. With 11% of the vote, it’s Dawn and R.J. [Kristin laughs] Picking up, uhh, maybe half a head of steam here in second place, with 39% of the vote, it’s that coveted sandwich that goes bottom layer, Anya, middle layer, R.J., top layer, Willow. Or rearrange the layers to your liking. [Kristin laughs] And in first place, it had to be.
Kristin: Of course.
Jenny: With 49% of the vote—
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: Xander and Spike. Together again, reunited and it feels so good.
Kristin: They were roommates!
Jenny: They were roommates! [both laugh]
Kristin: A quick note, though you probably already saw it if you were on social media. We have new stuff in the store. Sweatpants that say Pay Buffy Summers. They rule. Jenny and I, before we put them up on sale, were like, send us each a pair! Before they sell out! [both laughing] We want the sweatpants. We’ve got Smash the Demon Lizard Patriarchy on long-sleeve for the first time. We have sticker packs, which honestly are my favorite thing ever—
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Which combine Why Are Men, Smash the Demon Lizard Patriarchy, the little yowler cat just saying "No." [Jenny laughs] And some other really fun patriarchy-smashing designs from our past. And we have some Willow candles back in stock in the store [Jenny gasps] and they actually are in stock, as of today. So that’s big news, because usually they go so quick that I can’t even tell you about them in the intro. So they’re there, while they last. [both laugh]
Jenny: Hot! Speaking of things that are hot! [Kristin laughs] We have a very special guest this episode. Friend of the pod and prince of our hearts—
Kristin: [pleased] Ugh.
Jenny: Hrishikesh Hirway—
Kristin: [pleased] Ugh!
Jenny: Is with us today to discuss this episode. Also, Hrishi and I wrote this episode’s song together and produced it together. And you know what happens
when Hrishi gets involved with our podcast: great things!
Kristin: Great things.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Great things happen.
Kristin: The song is gorgeous. I just finished editing the episode and listening to, like, Hrishi’s voice in my ears is just like, [laughs] I—
Jenny: It’s so soothing.
Kristin: It’s so—
Jenny: It’s like a massage from the inside.
Kristin: Oh—oh, well, okay, yes? But—
Jenny: Well. [laughs]
Kristin: I’m gonna continue forward. [laughs]
Jenny: Sorry. [laughs]
Kristin: So.
Jenny: Uhh! [laughs]
Kristin: I also wanna let everyone know that we have a special segment up on Patreon today. It is not behind a paywall, it is free for everyone, where Alba is in conversation with our listener, Shaunga. Shaunga is an ancestral communicator and emailed us when she knew that we were approaching Conversations with Dead People. Shaunga notes that there are different names to describe what she can do. They include psychic medium, channeller, clairvoyant, energy reader. Her use of "ancestral communicator" describes her ability to receive messages and speak to anything that has an energy or an essence, including animals, elements in the natural world, alternate timelines and, notably, dead people. The link to that conversation is in today’s show notes, and a big thank you to Alba and Shaunga for having the conversation.
Jenny: Yeah!
Kristin: I’m going to skip the email today, because we have a long episode. It’s a big episode, Conversations with Dead People. But I will tease that next time we
have an episode up, I will read an email, the title of which is: "Give Hecate a break!" [laughs]
Jenny: It would be nice!
Kristin: It would be, wouldn’t it? [laughs] Alright, Jenny, let’s do it.
Jenny: Indeed.
NOTES: [Buffering theme plays]
Jenny: Hello and welcome, dear listener, to Buffering the Vampire Slayer! A podcast where we’re watching and discussing every episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, one by one, spoiler free, in tandem with those gals I’d love to haunt but in a nice way, Angel On Top! I am Jenny Owen Youngs.
Kristin: And I’m Kristin Russo, and this week we are talking about Season 7, Episode 7, Conversations with Dead People. In my notes, I had not changed it from Him. And I’m so superstitious about that, I don’t know where that came from. But I just—while you were talking, Jenny—changed it, like, real quick. [laughing] ‘Cause I was like, if I don’t change it, this episode’s gonna be trash. [both laugh] So we’re on Season 7—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Episode 7, Conversations with Dead People. And if you like, you should stay tuned at the end of this podcast every other week for an original song written by Jenny—although, Jenny, do you wanna interrupt me to talk about this week’s song? Recapping the episode?
Jenny: Joining me in the composition of this week’s song, and joining us for this episode, it’s friend of the pod—
Kristin: Holy shit.
Jenny: Very tall drink of water, Hrishikesh Hirway. [Hrishi laughs] Hello, Hrishi!
Kristin: Hi, Hrishi!
Hrishi: Hi, hi, hi.
Kristin: Wow. We did it. [laughs]
Jenny: We did.
Hrishi: It’s so nice to be back.
Kristin: Oh my gosh.
Jenny: Reunited and it feels so good!
Kristin: I mean, the last time that we had you here in our sweet vampire embrace, it was all the way back in Hush. Is that right?
Hrishi: That’s right. Yeah.
Kristin: That’s, like, eons. So much has happened—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Bananas.
Kristin: Hrishi. [laughs]
Hrishi: Yeah. So many seasons have passed, both on the show and in our own lives. [laughs]
Kristin: In our own lives. [Kristin and Jenny laugh] It was truly—truly, we were different humans, all of us, back then. Anyhow. Jenny, please—please tell us—although this episode will tell us when it aired—but you should tell us, as well.
Jenny: Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure! [Kristin laughs] Conversations with Dead People was written by Jane Espenson and Drew Goddard, but put a little asterisk next to that—
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: That we’ll come back to in a sec. Directed by Nick Marck! [Kristin laughs] And originally aired on November 12th, 2002, just ten days before I turned 21—
Kristin: Yes.
Jenny: Years old.
Kristin: [sighs] I thought of you when it came across the screen.
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: [simultaneously] I was like, she must be so satisfied that the date is—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Written there for her to do birthday math.
Jenny: Oh, yeah. [Hrishi laughs] It’s a good feeling.
Kristin: [simultaneously] According to IMDB, this is the one where Buffy strikes up a conversation with a vampire who was once an acquaintance in high school. Dawn defends Joyce from a menacing creature. I give that a D minus on summarizing this episode [laughter] from IMDB. [laughter] Yeah, Jen—I have that same asterisk on the writers, Jenny. Do you wanna talk about that before we even, like, jump into it all?
Jenny: I…do. And man, this really hit a very satisfying place in my heart when I finally learned these facts. Because when Hrishi and I got together to write the song, we were like, hmm, yeah, okay. So writing the song from Buffy’s perspective, but Buffy’s kind of, like, the least—in our experience, like, not the most compelling thing that’s going on—
Kristin: Right.
Jenny: In the ep. And it feels kind of tonally different from everything else that’s going on. [Kristin laughs] And hey, there’s a very good explanation for this.
Hrishi: Oh!
Jenny: Because while the writing of this episode is credited to Jane and Drew, it was actually split up between four writers. Jane Espenson wrote the Dawn scenes. Drew Goddard wrote the geek trio scenes.
Hrishi: Mmmm.
Jenny: Joss wrote the Buffy/Holden scenes. And Marti Noxon wrote the Willow/Cassie scenes. Since Joss and Marti were EPs on the show, they would often forgo formal credit for their contributions on various scripts, which is why it’s credited to Jane and Drew.
Hrishi: Wow. That—
Jenny: What you think about that?!
Hrishi: Is pretty cool. I mean, it reminds me of that movie, Four Rooms?
Jenny: Mm! Mmhmm.
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Hrishi: Or all those other movies that are in that kind of…[Jenny and Kristin laugh] what do you call those? Um, those kind of—
Jenny: Hmm.
Hrishi: Anthology movies.
Kristin: Right.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah, I read that—I got these facts right before I did my rewatch. And it definitely impacted the way that I took in the scenes. Because, like, I mean, the Buffy—what’s his name, this vampire? Who I wanna—
Jenny: Holden.
Hrishi: [simultaneously] Psych major.
Jenny: Holden Webster, of course.
Kristin: Holden—oh, Webs, right. Good old Webs. Yeah, I—I don’t know how I would have felt, watching it, not knowing whatever. But I wanted to murder this vampire. I guess you call it "slay." [laughs] I wanted to slay this vampire [Jenny laughs] from the moment he opened his mouth. And like, knowing that—’cause I think it’s really well—I actually think it’s a really well-written, like, dialogue. But also, I want to kill this vampire for all of his bullshit. And I wanted to do that even more once I learned who was writing—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Hmm.
Kristin: Who was really digging into—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Hmm! [laughs]
Kristin: Buffy’s brain, via this vampire. [laughs]
Hrishi: Mmm.
Kristin: You know what I mean?
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Hrishi: I’m not as familiar with, uh—with Jane Espenson. But learning this, it is very satisfying, because it really tracks with what I think of when—with those other three writers. That Drew Goddard wrote the trio, and that Marti Noxon wrote the "punch me in the heart" stuff, with Tara and Willow. Yeah, and that Joss wrote the part that I didn’t like as much.
Kristin: Yeah. [laughter] Yeah, Jane—
Jenny: Just for reference, let me run you down some Jane Espenson episodes.
Hrishi: Okay.
Jenny: We’ve got Band Candy. We’ve got A New Man, where Giles is transformed into a demon. We’ve got Superstar, where everyone loves Jonathan.
Kristin: Mmm.
Jenny: We’ve got Triangle, which features the triangulation of Willow, Anya and Xander, and then Olaf the troll shows up. A classic. I Was Made to Love You, introduction of April the robot, who is the…preceder of the Buffybot.
Hrishi: Mmhmm.
Jenny: We’ve got Intervention, which is the episode—oh, god, that makes me cry to describe, where Spike is captured by Glory. And Glory’s trying to figure out who the Key is and she, like, tortures the shit out of him—
Hrishi: Right.
Jenny: And all the Scoobies assume that Spike gave up the info.
Hrishi: Right.
Jenny: And the way that they decide to figure it out is that they send the Buffybot in to be like, "Why didn’t you tell her?" And then the Buffybot kisses Spike, but then it’s really Buffy! Ahh!
Kristin: That’s my biggest—like, if you were to say, like, what is your biggest Jenny and Buffy memory? It is Jenny—before I had ever seen the series—telling me about that scene, [Hrishi laughs] and just weeping. Just, like, absolutely—
Jenny: While driving a car. [laughter] Do not describe the plot of Intervention while driving, Jenny. Note to self. [laughter]
Kristin: Yeah, I mean, I think—I’m not sure if this tracks for all of those episodes that you just listed, Jenny. But I feel like Jane is really good at also just, like, doing a thing to its nth degree. Like, she just goes so hard on, like, Exorcist, Poltergeist—like, every horror thing. And I was thinking about it, ‘cause like, the characters in the show are all being impacted in specific ways. Right? Like, they’re being manipulated and all of those manipulations are so specific to them. And so what I love about Jane’s writing and Dawn’s situation is that just the, like, classic horror connecting to the fact that she’s watching this, like, horror movie on TV. It just seems very Dawn. The whole—
Hrishi: Mmm.
Kristin: Like, that’s how you get to her. That’s how you get to this, like, you know, sophomore in high school who’s watching horror movies, is you give her that horror. So I really liked it.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Jenny: I also feel like Jane really does great sort of, like, simultaneous hilarity and punch you in the guts as well.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Like, the things that Dawn does when left to her own devices. [laughs] Um—
Kristin: Oh my god. [laughs] Cannot wait.
Jenny: Good lord! [laughter] But yeah, so I was very satisfied to learn this. And I’ll tell you another thing, Kristin, Hrishi, dear listener. The other options that they came up with when they were conceptualizing, you know, what other dead people could be conversed with—
Kristin: Oh, yeah!
Jenny: Amber Benson was asked to come back as Tara, and she declined. They thought about bringing Eric Balfour back as Jesse—
Kristin: I would have—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Who died in the pilot.
Kristin: Loved that.
Hrishi: Wow.
Jenny: To have conversed with Xander, but they didn’t do that. And as a result, this is the only episode in the whole series with no Xander. Well played, Hrishi. [laughs]
Hrishi: Hey-hey! [laughter]
Jenny: You got here at the right time. [laughter] And they thought about bringing Halfrek back, but Kali was unavailable. So that is—
Kristin: Kali was over on—doing Broadway shows or West End—music—
Jenny: Noises Off, probably?
Kristin: Right? Yeah. She was busy. Yeah.
Hrishi: It was a mixed bag for me. No Xander, hey! No Giles, aww.
Kristin: Yeah, no Giles. That’s true.
Jenny: He’s away. He’s in England. He’s off being English.
Kristin: [simultaneously] But you’re here, [Hrishi laughs] so it’s like we get a little dash of Giles—
Jenny: [simultaneously] [laughs] Oh, true.
Kristin: In the universe. [laughs]
Hrishi: How weird is it now that—just that we see Giles everywhere as a bad guy on TV these days.
Jenny: It’s weird, I don’t—
Kristin: [simultaneously] [gasps] Whose name is Rupert! Some of the time.
Hrishi: Yeah, exactly.
Jenny: [laughs] Yeah.
Kristin: Like, what the fuck? Yeah. [laughs]
Jenny: Doesn’t feel right.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: [laughs] Yeah. Well. Should we talk—just for a moment, before we dive into the beginning of the episode—about the Previously Ons? Because—
Jenny: It’s so—it’s, like, the crisp-est Previouslys ever. It’s like, previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Tara died, Warren was flayed, Andrew and Jonathan exist, Spike has a soul, Cassie died. From beneath you, it devours. Hrishi, just so you know, on this podcast, [Kristin and Hrishi laugh] when "from beneath you, it devours" is invoked, we say, FBYID!
Kristin: Yep. And—
Jenny: Which just rolls right off the tongue. As you can tell. [laughter]
Kristin: [simultaneously] Jenny always says it like that, too.
Hrishi: Right, right. Sure.
Kristin: Like, that’s the inflection, you know?
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: I say just the letters, but Jenny, you know—Jenny Jenny’fies it, so. [Hrishi laughs] I do have FBYID written in my notes with a space between each letter, to end the Previously On, so it is stuck. But this is, like, the antithesis of the last Previously Ons. The Previously Ons for Him were like, I don’t know, you don’t really need to know anything to get into this wild episode. [Jenny laughs] But this one, it was like, okay, you gotta remember fucking this and this shit and this other thing and this other fucking thing [laughs] to get you set up. And that’s why it’s so—you know. The editor was thankful, I think, that he got some shit—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: To actually do in this Previously On. [Hrishi laughs]
Jenny: Yeah, yeah. It’s very clear. So, we begin at The Bronze, at 8:01 PM. On November 12th, 2002. Which is—
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: The time at which the episode was airing. [Hrishi laughs]
Kristin: Yeah. And this is the only episode that has a title screen, except for Once More, with Feeling. "Conversations with Dead People," in quotes, comes on the screen. And I was like, this feels like a thing I haven’t seen before. And—
Jenny: Yeah, interesting.
Kristin: You know, obvi—I mean, Once More, with Feeling, it feels like that doesn’t even count, because of course there’s a title screen for that. It’s a fucking musical. But this is the only title screen, and the only time when we get, like, that kind of a title and then timestamp. Hrishi, I’m particularly excited that you’re here, for many reasons. But one, because, like, Angie Hart is just fucking playing The Bronze, singing her shit and like, I don’t know. You know, when I think of you, I think of lots of things but music is one of them. So I get two musicians to talk about. Angie Hart and Frente! You know, if you feel like it. [laughs] With…
Jenny: Yeah. I, too, was watching this, taking notes. I was like, oh, thank god Hrishi is gonna be here. Because you know how when you’re on tour, you always plug everything in, in front of an audience. And your drummer hits one cymbal, like, eight times to test it? [Kristin laughs] And then you just start playing a set?
Hrishi: [laughing] Yeah, yeah, yeah. [Kristin laughs]
Jenny: You’re always doing this shit. [laughs]
Hrishi: Yep. I mean, it’s a—it was basically a preview of what people are gonna see when they come to see us. [Kristin laughs]
Jenny: Yes.
Hrishi: We’ll be sound checking in front of everybody [Jenny laughs] and then going right into the songs.
Jenny: Yes. Hrishi—
Hrishi: [simultaneously] I will be playing the cymbal eight times.
Jenny: [laughs] You’re playing the cymbal, I’m playing the bass, going into some rack gear for—[Hrishi laughs] this is, like, a very sophisticated—it’s simultaneously a sophisticated rig, that I’m not 100% sure belongs on stage, and also, the most amateur soundcheck of all time. [laughter]
Hrishi: I was introduced to Frente! when I was a freshman in college, which just feels…it just feels perfect for what’s going on here and this psych major and everything. Like, it all came together for me in a really satisfying way, because [Kristin laughs] yeah, listening to that Frente! record with the cover of Bizarre Love Triangle on it—
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Hrishi: Was, um…
Jenny: Oh, yeah.
Hrishi: I just—I feel like—even though it was a few years before this episode aired. To me, the era feels right.
Kristin: Yeah. I was surprised to see that—it’s Marvin the Album that I was familiar with. And it came out in—according to my research, it came out in 1992. Which, I was like, really? That seems so early—
Hrishi: [simultaneously] Wow!
Kristin: Because—I know! ‘Cause for me, it was a similar time—it was like, 90—in, like, ‘98, maybe? In the, like, ‘98-99, that like—
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: That album came to me and—
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: I was boppin’ around to Accidentally—Accidently Kelly Street.
Hrishi: Right. [Hrishi and Jenny laugh]
Kristin: And I loved—like, I fucking loved Frente! I played that album—it was, like, one of my main albums in those years. But I guess it had been out for a while.
Hrishi: Yeah. God, I didn’t realize that at all.
Kristin: Yeah. Correct me, Jen—I can see Jenny’s research face on, so maybe she’ll—
Jenny: Well. [laughter] Yeah, no, Marvin the Album was ‘92. I was curious because my introduction was Shape, which came out in ‘96. And then I worked backwards, so I got into them right when Shape came out.
Hrishi: [simultaneously] Mmm.
Kristin: [simultaneously] So maybe that’s what happened. Yeah. I just remember Marvin the Album so much more, but maybe that’s what happened is that, you know, they had a new release. And then, you know, that hit in a way where the—a lot of us went back into the archives. But—
Hrishi: Part of the fun of Marvin the Album for me was singing along. Which
reminds me of an Onion headline, one of my favorites. [Kristin laughs] Which is: "Boyfriend announces plan to spend infuriating afternoon speaking in Australian accent." [laughter]
Kristin: Oh, god. Jenny, you’ve been kind of, like, nodding along and what have you. I imagine that these albums were sort of importance to you at the same time.
Jenny: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kristin: [simultaneously] We were all just on our own little orbits, not knowing that in the year 2022, we would be discussing [Hrishi laughs] Marvin the Album, together.
Jenny: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I listened to—I listened to their records. Like, I wore the records out. I sought out the, like, import versions of singles with B sides—
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Which is a thing that you used to have to do, to hear everyone’s complete discography. It wasn’t all just on a streaming platform and on a single page. [laughter] I’m looking at the cover art of Shape, which looks like a demented Fruitopia ad?
Kristin: Oh, interesting.
Jenny: It’s like, a sun [Hrishi laughs] made of a foot—
Hrishi: Yep. Yep, yep.
Jenny: Like, all the spokes of the sun are just toes.
Hrishi: [simultaneously] Yes, yes.
Kristin: Ohh! Okay—
Hrishi: It’s really disturbing.
Jenny: And it’s like, in front of an island—
Hrishi: Yeah.
Jenny: And like, [laughing] a blue sky with fluffy clouds. It’s like—
Kristin: As soon as you said "foot," the, like, memory dislodged itself from inside of my head. [Hrishi laughs]
Jenny: There are two more things that I personally would wanna note here, watching Angie Hart—
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: At The Bronze. First of all, apparently, this song was co-written by Angie Hart and Joss Whedon. [Hrishi gasps]
Kristin: He did a better job than he did with that Firefly theme song, I’ll tell you what. [laughter] I think Angie shoulda helped him out on that as well. [laughter]
Jenny: I know! Hrishi, I’m making Kristin watch Firefly and I don’t know if you’ve ever heard the theme song, but it’s…regrettable.
Kristin: We don’t like it.
Hrishi: [simultaneously] I must have because I’ve seen the whole series, but I—
Kristin: Yeah.
Hrishi: I…I don’t know.
Kristin: You blotted that out.
Hrishi: Skip intro? [laughter]
Kristin: Yeah. [laughter]
Jenny: Good call.
Hrishi: My porn name is Skip Intro.
Jenny: [laughs and claps] Straight to the good stuff.
Kristin: So good. [laughs]
Jenny: The other thing that I wanted to note here is that, I was noticing that a member of Angie Hart’s band is playing a harmonium. And I went on a little research dive, and I wanted to share some things that I thought would be interesting. Hrishi, my fellow musician, please feel free to jump in if you know anything that I don’t know.
Hrishi: That’s not true, I’ve already downloaded—
Kristin: [simultaneously] What if I know something?
Hrishi: [laughs] Yeah.
Kristin: What if I surprise you? [laughter]
Jenny: Sorry, Kristin, I didn’t mean to count you out. [laughter]
Hrishi: In the Venn diagram of all things that Jenny knows, everything that I know is a smaller circle within—wholly encompassed—[laughter]
Jenny: No!
Hrishi: [laughing] Within the circle—Jenny’s circle.
Jenny: Okay, I hate everything about that except that we’re eternally holding each other. [laughter]
Hrishi: Well, you’re holding me. I’m the little spoon.
Kristin: Awww! [laughter]
Jenny: Okay, so get a load of this shit. In 1779, a man—a man—there was a man. [laughter] There was a man named Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein. Okay? And this guy was a physiology professor known for experimenting with the effects of electricity on the human body. And he was allegedly the inspiration for Mary Shelley’s Dr. Frankenstein. [Kristin gasps]
Hrishi: Wow.
Jenny: This guy’s chillin’. Mmm, I think in…[hesitantly] Denmark? Okay, I didn’t write down where he was from.
Kristin: [simultaneously] Spooky Denmark! [laughter]
Jenny: Spooky Denmark. And he was really inspire—he really loved this Chinese instrument called the sheng, which is a free-reed instrument shaped like a vertical pipe. And inspired by this, he created a small, pneumatic organ fitted with free reeds, that you pumped air through with little pedals. And other people got wind of this of this little pneumatic organ and they started—
Kristin: [simultaneously] Ha-ha. "Got wind." Of it. [Hrishi and Kristin laugh]
Jenny: [simultaneously] You know, modifying it. Making their own little changes. [laughs] And, um, then in 1840, a guy called Alexandre Debain, who is from France—was the first person to name it the harmonium and get the patent for it.
Hrishi: Hm.
Jenny: So, this is the 1840s. They’re taking Europe by storm because they’re smaller than pianos and they’re not impacted by weather, so they’re not, like, constantly falling out of tune and having to be tuned again. They become really popular across Europe, but then, in the early 1900s, they start to wane. However. Due to migration, colonialism and the like, they’ve been sort of transported all—they’ve Johnny-Appleseeded themselves all over the globe. And in particular, they’ve become popular in India, where a company, in 1875, called Dwarkin & Sons adapted the instrument to be half the size and operated by hand bellows instead of the foot pedals.
Kristin: Mmm.
Jenny: And by 1915, India had become the world’s leader in harmonium production.
Kristin: Hot damn. [Jenny exhales]
Hrishi: Wouldn’t it be great if harmonium was just an element on the periodic table that you needed to craft instruments? [Jenny laughs]
Kristin: Mmm. It does.
Jenny: What would the letter—abbreviation—
Kristin: [simultaneously] HM.
Jenny: Code be?
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: HM.
Jenny: HM.
Hrishi: HM.
Kristin: Big H, little M.
Jenny: Hmm!
Hrishi: Because it kind of—
Kristin: [simultaneously] See, I knew I’d be able to contribute something!
Jenny: [simultaneously] Hmmmmmmm. [laughter] Yeah!
Hrishi: Because that’s kind of what the instrument does too. Hmmmmm.
Kristin: Hmmmm! Ugh!
Jenny: Hell yeah. [laughter]
Kristin: Oh, I love this. What’s the—just real quick. What’s the one that’s, like, maybe kinda like a harmonium but you blow through a tube, using your mouth? What’s that?
Hrishi: Melodica.
Jenny: [simultaneously] A…melodica.
Kristin: Melodica. I know that, like, we need to get off of, like, Angie Hart and what have you. But if it pleases everyone, I would like to say just two more quick Angie Hart facts. [Jenny laughs]
Hrishi: Mmhmm.
Jenny: [laughing] Okay.
Kristin: Is that okay?
Hrishi: Are they Angie Hart—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Absolutely.
Kristin: They just—
Hrishi: Joss Whedon facts? ‘Cause there are apparently a lot of those.
Kristin: Ye—well. [Jenny laughs] Sort of, yes. But very specific, I think, to this
universe. One: she sang backup vocals on Under Your Spell and her then-husband, Jesse…Tobias?
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: I don’t know if that’s how you say his name—was the music co-director for the musical episode—
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Which I didn’t know. And also, speaking of fucking Firefly, I haven’t seen this episode yet. But apparently, Angie Hart is on Heart of Gold.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah.
Kristin: And sings in that episode as well. So I don’t have any other facts. I’m not sure I wanna know any other facts, to be honest with you, but [laughter] those are the two facts I have.
Hrishi: It’s nice. It’s a—it’s a collaboration that runs deep.
Kristin: Mmhmm, yeah. As I was reading, I thought perhaps. Anyway!
Jenny: So Angie Hart’s all like, [singing] "Where were you? Where were you?" And the director of the episode is like, well. Buffy is patrolling the cemetery and Spike is drinking at The Bronze and Willow is at the UC Sunnydale library and Dawn is at home.
Kristin: Yeah. Fucking, about to microwave some goddamn marshmallows.
Jenny: Yeah. [laughter] And then I feel like in a moment that, like, really feels like the culmination of where we are, in the series—especially after Season 6—Buffy is next to a grave. A fresh grave. And a hand comes up and she says, sounding so world weary, "Here we go."
Kristin: Ugh! Right into the credits.
Hrishi: It was very, um, "time to make the donuts," Dunkin Donut—[laughter] like, 80s commercial. Is that a reference that everybody gets?
Jenny: [simultaneously] Yeah, exactly.
Kristin: Oh yeah, I mean, I got it.
Jenny: [simultaneously] I remember—I remember Fred the Donut Guy being, like, way more excited about making the donuts. But maybe I’m just remembering the good rounds of donuts that he made. [Hrishi laughs]
Kristin: I think he was always a little tired, ‘cause it was real early—
Hrishi: [simultaneously] Yeah, that’s what I remember, is he just woke up—
Jenny: Mmm.
Hrishi: You know, he wakes up, it’s dark out. And he gets up and he’s, like, groggy and he just says, [sleepily] "Time to make the donuts."
Kristin: Yeah. [laughs] Please tweet at us, @BufferingCast, and let us know your memories of the—what’s his name?
Jenny: I think it’s Fred.
Kristin: Incredible. Would have never known what his name was.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah. So here we go. And this is…I mean, to your point, Jenny, of like, situating us where we are in Buffy’s psyche at this point. This is a massive episode for, like, turning us into the rest of the season. ‘Cause we’ve been talking, like, in the last few episodes, of like, so. What’s happening? Like, we’re all over the fucking place. Buffy’s, like, falling in love with a guy in a letterman jacket. This is happening, that’s happening, and this episode…so much happens. So. Why don’t we start with Jonathan and Andrew?
Hrishi: For the record. If I were to see somebody—
Kristin: [simultaneously] Mm.
Hrishi: In a David Letterman jacket, I would fall in love with them too. [laughter]
Kristin: Ba-dun-dun-chh!
Jenny: Is that…is that, like, a jacket with a David Letterman, like, logo? Or is it a jacket made of David Letterman’s—
Hrishi: [laughs] Wow.
Jenny: Hide?
Hrishi: [laughing] That’s very dark.
Kristin: Whoa, Jenny!
Jenny: [simultaneously] What are we talking about exactly, here?
Kristin: Okay! We’re only a few—
Jenny: [simultaneously] The people have a right to know.
Hrishi: [simultaneously] [laughing] Are Girl Scout cookies made with real girl scouts? [laughter]
Kristin: Yes. Exactly. [laughs] [sighs] Alright. Jonathan and Andrew are coming back to Sunnydale. They are returning from Mexico. There is this…like, I kind of appreciate this—Andrew being like, "I didn’t wanna—like, I didn’t wanna speak the language. Everybody was speaking this language." And then Jonathan immediately being like, "You literally learned all of Klingon. Like, what the fuck?" [Hrishi laughs] Because that’s just such a thing.
Jenny: My dude.
Kristin: It’s like, you learn what you wanna learn, humans. So, examine your fucking choices [laughs] and your bullshit. And then Andrew—yeah, I can see Jenny’s little—[Jenny laughs] what do you call these little hands? These little scheming hands? Go ahead, Jenny.
Hrishi: Wallace and Gromit hands?
Jenny: Hmm.
Kristin: [laughing] Yeah.
Hrishi: Cheese. [laughter]
Kristin: Go ahead, Jenny, I won’t talk anymore. I’ll let you say the things you wanna say.
Jenny: Okay, well, we learn that Andrew and Jonathan have been having bad dreams. In which it is said, "desde abajo te devora." It eats you starting with your bottom! [Kristin laughs] IEYSWYB! That’s it, that’s what I got.
Kristin: "It eats you starting with your bottom" is a great—[Jenny laughs] that’s good. That’s good, that’s good writing right there. That makes me laugh. Every time I see it, it makes me laugh. [laughter]
Hrishi: It reminds me of a skip intro video. [laughter]
Kristin: One of your first, I think. [laughter] To—I have a little hellmath for us, if you’ll permit me.
NOTES: [HELLMATH jingle plays] Hellmath!
Kristin: The boys sort of roll into Sunnydale. We see the Welcome to Sunnydale
sign, and it says "Population: 32,900." The last time we saw the sign [Jenny gasps] was in School Hard, and the population was 38,500. School Hard aired on September 29th, 1997, approximately five years ago to the day [Jenny laughs] of this moment. That means that since then, 5600 people in Sunnydale have died, which means approximately, every year, 1,120 people die. Which means that every week, approximately 21 and one-half people die, which is an average of three per day. Three deaths per day in Sunnydale. Boom, you’ve been hell-mathed. You’re welcome.
Hrishi: [laughing] Wait, wait. But. [Kristin laughs] Kristin, just to bring—[laughter] just to invoke my sister, data scientist. Uh. Presumably, some number of people are also being born, which means even more people are dying.
Kristin: Oh, goddamnit!
Jenny: Ohh no!
Kristin: [laughs] Okay. Okay, but that—yeah, that is important to factor in.
Hrishi: But net deaths.
Kristin: Net deaths, right. And—yes. [laughter] You’re right, you’re right, you’re right. God, I didn’t know I was gonna have a brother of a data scientist up in here, checking my facts. [laughter] Better you being here than the 40,000 emails I would have gotten if you hadn’t said it on the podcast. [laughter]
Hrishi: [simultaneously] Right, right. Right, right. Send your complaints to netdeaths@bufferingthevampireslayer.com. [laughter]
Kristin: Anyhow. Off we go. We’re in the cemetery, quickly. We’re fighting. And then we’re at the scene that we wanna be at, which is Dawn’s poem. Would you like to deliver it—would anyone else like—
Jenny: [simultaneously] No, please.
Kristin: I love Dawn. Hrishi, I don’t—Dawn didn’t even exist. Dawn was a fucking Key the last time I saw you.
Hrishi: [laughing] Right.
Kristin: But I love Dawn. Okay? [laughter] Dawn is eating pizza and she says, "Anchovies, anchovies, you’re so delicious. I love you more than all the other fishes." So good! I love Dawn.
Jenny: [sighs] It’s good. [laughing] She’s getting up to all kinds of nonsense! [Kristin laughs] She’s getting sauce on Buffy’s clothes. She’ll think it’s blood. It’s fine! [Hrishi laughs] She is taking my number one pet peeve to the next level. Firing—not just firing a crossbow, but firing a crossbow…[Kristin laughs] indoors! [laughter] Ma’am! No.
Kristin: This—
Jenny: She’s covering up the damage with a houseplant.
Kristin: This checks for me. Like, this brought me back, honestly—not to high school, but like, more to, like, eighth grade. Like, I feel like—I didn’t have any crossbows. But like—
Jenny: Thank god.
Kristin: Microwaving marshmallows. Just shit like that. It’s like, what the fuck were we doing when we were, like, [Jenny laughs] 14 years old at our houses by ourselves? Kinda a lot of stuff like this. For me, anyway.
Hrishi: Yeah. I will say, her level of juvenile delinquency here is even more juvenile than I think how old she actually is supposed to be.
Kristin: [laughing] Yeah. Yeah. [laughter] So we only get fun in this clip, and then it ends with a bang, but not the, like, "yay, it ended with a bang." Just, like, an actual bang that’s kind of spooky. But who knows what that was?
Hrishi: Yeah. This part—this whole subplot was too scary for me.
Kristin: This is my shit.
Jenny: [simultaneously] [laughing] Yeah, Hrishi—
Kristin: This is my jam.
Jenny: Hrishi, tell Kristin how you watched this episode. [laughter]
Kristin: Oh my god. What?
Hrishi: I had to use, you know, finger eye guards. [laughter]
Kristin: Oh, because you—’cause you don’t like the horror? [laughs]
Hrishi: I don’t like it. It was too scary. Sometimes this show…
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Hrishi: Is too scary. And this was definitely—
Kristin: The—the—
Hrishi: You know. Pretty much, I don’t know that there’s—there are other scary parts in this series. But this is pretty much 10/10 scariness, I think. The, you know, flashes of light and the—well, I won’t jump ahead in the recap, but—
Kristin: No, I was gonna jump right there ‘cause I was gonna say that—
Hrishi: [simultaneously] Okay.
Kristin: Those flash—that shit was—that’s scary.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: That’s good. But I love it. It’s funny that you don’t do well with the scariest things, and we’ve brought you here for this episode, which is pretty scary, with Dawn. And also, the last time you were here, it was Hush, which is…pretty much one of the scariest episodes, I think.
Hrishi: [simultaneously] Pretty terrifying, yeah.
Jenny: Yeah. [laughter] Really facing your fears.
Hrishi: Yep. [Kristin laughs] Yes. This is…my eight-year subplot of immersion therapy for me is working. [laughter] Or is it? [laughter]
Jenny: We also, in this scene—I just wanna note, because Kristin and I were texting about this at the times of our separate watches. We hear a song, which is called Nicolito. And it’s by Los Cubaztecas and Pancho Cataneo. And it goes sort of like, [sings tune]. And we were both like, what is the other song—
Hrishi: Ah.
Jenny: That happens in the kitchen that’s, like, very much—
Kristin: [simultaneously] From this same—I guess it’s not this radio, but from a radio.
Jenny: Right, right, right. And I did a little digging and that song is called Tahitian Swing by New Age World and it goes—
Kristin: Mmm.
Jenny: [sings tune] And there’s something about…emotional episodes involving Joyce and trauma—
Kristin: Yeah! Yeah!
Jenny: And Summers women hanging out in the kitchen that, like, for whatever reason, the music supervisor is like, this is the sort of, like, sonic vibe that we wanna pair with this idea. And I…I don’t know. I mean, it’s like, memorable. It’s, like, very effective.
Kristin: Yeah, ‘cause like, the episode—I don’t know if you said—but it’s Listening to Fear, which is an episode most of us remember because of the Queller demon that, like, suctions itself across the fucking ceiling, like a—
Jenny: Nope.
Kristin: Fucking creep. [Hrishi laughs] But—
Jenny: Avoid it, Hrishi. [laughter]
Kristin: Yeah, don’t watch that one, Hrishi. But like, it’s sort of like Joyce is facing possible illness—like, you know what I mean? Like, it’s like, one of the first episodes where it’s like, oh no, like, Mom isn’t okay. And Buffy is sort of, like, processing that, even though Joyce is alive, to the radio playing a song like this. And then we have Dawn sort of, like, inversely having this hope that maybe she can, like, talk to her mom again with this song—it’s just like, it has to be intentional, right? It can’t just be coincidence.
Jenny: It pinged for both of us. Who knows if we’re right. Answer not found.
Kristin: Anyway.
Hrishi: Could you make a ringtone of Jenny going, [sings tune] [laughter]
Kristin: Listeners. Go ahead, who’s gonna win? First one—first one gets a prize. I don’t know what it is yet.
Jenny: A treat. [laughter]
Kristin: A treat, a special treat.
Jenny: First one gets a microwaved marshmallow. [laughter] Mailed to you from us.
Kristin: Mailed to you, yeah. Yeah. [laughs]
Jenny: You know when you’re like—you know when you’re a teen and you’re at home alone, microwaving a marshmallow. [Hrishi laughs] And you’re watching it get bigger and you’re just like, cool. [laughter] She says "cool!" It reminds me of—at the beginning of, like, five different Shania Twain songs—
Kristin: Oh my god.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Shania Twain waits for a break in between repetitions—
Hrishi: Mmhmm.
Jenny: Of the chord progression and she’ll go…cool! [laughter] And it, like, has the same energy. [laughs] Okay.
Hrishi: [imitating Shania Twain] So you got bigger in the microwave. [Jenny and Kristin laugh]
Kristin: Oh my god, bless your soul, Hrishi. [laughter] ‘Cause I was over here, literally spinning. I was like, trying so hard to, like, snag a lyric from that song and fit it with this shit, and you did it, and I just love you so much. [laughter] Ohh, fuck. Okay. [laughs] So. Alright, so let’s fucking leave Dawn with her marshmallows. We’re going to the library for a little intro of what’s happening there, which is Cassie?
Jenny: I’m so pleased with this choice.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: In lieu of getting Amber Benson back, which I don’t think would have been the right move anyway, I think, like, bringing back somebody who made such an impression? You know, recently, but also who Willow never met in person.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Is just like, mm! It’s just so good.
Kristin: There’s also something I think that’s so much more powerful about her thinking that she’s talking to Tara through Cassie, and then real—like, there’s just something about that one step away that makes it more emotional for me than if it had been Tara sitting there.
Jenny: Yeah. Yeah.
Kristin: So in this scene…I mean, already, Alyson Hannigan is gonna make us fucking cry. It’s literally the first scene. And it’s just like, Cassie says, "She asked that I come and talk to you." Willow’s like, "What?" And she said, "She says she still sings." And she says, "Tara?" She—literally, her entire line is just "What?" and "Tara?"
Hrishi: Mmm.
Kristin: How are you doing, Hrishi? [laughs]
Hrishi: Um.
Jenny: [laughs] Are you watching this through your fingers? [laughter]
Hrishi: No, my—I mean. I was trying—because I haven’t watched the whole show in a while, I spent some time being like, [quietly] and who was Cassie? [laughs]
Kristin: Right. Right, right. [laughter] Literally one episode, but this actress nails it.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Jenny: She wrote a lot of—she wrote a lot of poetry. She had a vision of her own death and she told Buffy, who for some reason is now a counselor at the high school? And then Buffy spent—
Hrishi: [simultaneously] Right. And she had a heart attack? Is that right?
Kristin: Yeah. She, like—
Jenny: Or like an aneurysm or something.
Kristin: It was like, Buffy saved her from the clutches of patriarchal boys in robes. The episode was about to end—
Hrishi: [simultaneously] Right! Right, right right—
Kristin: [simultaneously] And she collapsed.
Hrishi: Yes, yes, yes.
Kristin: Because she—she knew.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: She knew that she was going to die and you couldn’t—it was sort of like the initial Final Destination.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: Initial? Original.
Hrishi: Yeah. In some ways, she could have been a Scooby, with those powers. It’s like, oh, we’ve discovered another person—
Kristin: [simultaneously] [whispers] Right?
Hrishi: With powers. But—
Kristin: I would have loved more Cassie.
Hrishi: Only—but then—but then she died.
Kristin: But then she died. Making everyone reflect on what it means when we can’t help somebody.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: Which is where that episode took us. [Jenny groans]
Hrishi: But it is nice, again, to have her be the person because it is another person with powers.
Kristin: Yeah. Yeah.
Jenny: Oh, yeah.
Kristin: Yeah.
Hrishi: It’s not some norm-core mortal, coming back.
Jenny: [laughing] Not some civilian.
Kristin: [simultaneously] As soon as you said "norm" I was like, you better say core. Or you’re outta here. [laughter] So, back to Dawn in the TV room. [Jenny sighs] She’s on the phone with Kit, which is exciting because—
Jenny: Yes! Goth girl Kit makes [laughs] probably her final appearance.
Kristin: Yeah, I think it is the final time she gets a mention. But we loved Kit for the brief moment we met her in the premiere, I think, of the season. This is, I think, of all of the scary things that happen? This is the one that scares me the most. This—Dawn’s watching TV.
Jenny: Oof.
Kristin: There’s like, a little, like, "What channel are you on? Tom Hanks, LOL." There’s another bang. The door blows open. She has turned the TV off. It turns back on. Hrishi, if you need to cover your ears, I understand. [laughter] And then she unplugs the TV and it’s still playing.
Jenny: Nooo!
Kristin: [simultaneously] That, to me, is the scariest shit in the fucking universe. I—I hate it so much, it’s so scary. [Hrishi laughs]
Jenny: Yeah, that’s some real Poltergeist…nightmare shit.
Kristin: Hoo! There’s a—the chairs, later, are like, straight out of Poltergeist. Hrishi, I’m gonna imagine you have not seen that film?
Jenny: [simultaneously] That’s—the chairs are not okay. [laughter]
Kristin: I’m gonna tell you a little bit about Poltergeist when we get there. But let’s go back to the cemetery first. [laughs]
Jenny: Before we look away from Dawn, I just wanna harken back to some money pinned to a corkboard. "This is for the store. No pizza."
Hrishi: Right.
Jenny: Underline.
Hrishi: Yes.
Jenny: And Dawn decided to use that money to possibly buy a marshmallow?
Kristin: No, she’s eating pizza!
Hrishi: [simultaneously] No, she got pizza. She got it—she specifically got—
Kristin: [simultaneously] Anchovies, anchovies. Remember her poem?
Hrishi: She was like, notes can’t tell me what to do.
Jenny: Oh my god, what is wrong with me? [Kristin laughs] I was so hung up on the marshmallow that I…[laughter] she sang a song about anchovies, damnit! [laughter] Okay, whew!
Hrishi: In defiance of the note.
Kristin: Definitely they have those marshmallows—
Jenny: [simultaneously] In defiance.
Kristin: In the house. Definitely, they have stock—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: On marshmallows in the Summers household.
Jenny: I assume she can only order anchovies when nobody else is around to get pizza.
Kristin: Yes. It’s like the definition of Dawn, you know?
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: She drives everybody nuts, but she just loves her fucking anchovies. And I love her for it. I said that already, but you’re welcome. It’s my podcast. [laughter] Alright. So the vampire. The vampire recognizes Buffy. He’s like, "Buffy? It’s Webs! Remember me? Holden Webster!" That’s it, that’s the whole scene.
Jenny: [groans] [laughter]
Kristin: The electronics are scaring me still at the Summers house. Dawn is smashing, now, every single thing.
Jenny: And out of the radio comes the voice of Joyce! Saying, "Dawn?" [Kristin exhales] Fuck!
Kristin: Also. That is scary and the important part of the scene. But I just wanna, like, say out loud that she smashes the fucking microwave with an ax? [Hrishi laughs] And it, like, short-circuits and there’s glass—it’s very dramatic. There’s a lot of repairs needed on this house after this episode.
Jenny: I really thought it was gonna be the kind of thing where, after the poltering was geisted—
Kristin: Oh—[Hrishi laughs]
Jenny: That, like, everything would go back to normal.
Hrishi: Yes. Yeah.
Jenny: [laughing] But what a huge bummer.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: This house is totaled at the end of this episode.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah.
Hrishi: I—[laughs] my dumb suspension of disbelief not working brain kept thinking like, so how do they do multiple takes? Like, what if she needed to re—[laughs] like, what if they have to do another take on that microwave ax smashing? [laughter]
Jenny: Dude. [laughter] Get out the backup. Reset!
Kristin: [simultaneously] So many microwaves. Just, like, a line of smashed microwaves—[Hrishi laughs]
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: On set that day. Yeah, but shit’s, um…real broken. And now, lucky for us, we’re gonna get to start really hearing what Webs—Holden Webster—has to say. I wondered how long I would make it before I played the Patriarchy jingle for this motherfucker, but I’ma just play it right here, at the top.
NOTES: [THE PATRIARCHY jingle plays] The patriarchy! [thunder clap, evil laughter]
Kristin: So he studied at Dartmouth. He is a taekwondo dude. And he is trying to tell Buffy where she knows him from. And really, the biggest thing that happens, I think, in this scene is…[laughs] that he finds out he’s a vampire and she’s a Slayer. And she’s the only one, and so now he’s, like, Psych 101 activate. Which is where we’re gonna hang out for most of this.
Hrishi: [laughs] One thing about Holden Webster. You know in Spiderman, he’s got his little thwip-twhip things, around his wrists?
Kristin: [simultaneously] Oh, yeah.
Jenny: Ha!
Hrishi: Those are, uh—you might call those his webbin’ holsters.
Kristin: Ooooh!
Jenny: [simultaneously] Oh my god!
Kristin: Ohh, Hrishi! Okay! [laughs]
Jenny: Uhh, sir, you’re gonna have to watch yourself or you’re gonna end up in the penalty box. [laughter]
Hrishi: Now that’s in your brain. Now I just made you—[laughs]
Kristin: [simultaneously] That’s two yellow flags. Two yellow flags on the field.
NOTES: [laughs]
Hrishi: [simultaneously] Hear that, sorry. [laughs]
Jenny: Oh, god! Can we talk about Scott Hope for one second?
Kristin: Yeah, dude. Oh, yeah, we learn about Scott Hope in this scene too, that’s right.
Jenny: So, Holden’s like, "ohh, you were, like, you know, mysterious in high school. You know, I heard you were dating an older guy." True. "Heard you were super religious." I understand where he got that idea.
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: The crosses all the time. "Scott Hope said you were gay." Here’s the thing. About this. At first, on my first viewing, it just flew right by me. But then on my second viewing, I started to think, when was Scott Hope around? When were Buffy and Scott Hope briefly going—
Kristin: [simultaneously] Oh my god.
Jenny: To Buster Keaton film festivals—
Kristin: [simultaneously] Oh my god!
Jenny: And when was Buffy being given a claddagh ring by Scott Hope?
Kristin: [simultaneously] Oh my fucking god! I think I know the answer!
Jenny: [simultaneously] Well, it’s right about when Faith got to town. Which is definitely the source of this rumor. That is just yet another brick…in the beautiful wall…
Hrishi: Wow.
Jenny: Of Buffy and Faith. 4eva.
Kristin: You know, they really blow it by having him say, like, "He says that—he said that about all the girls that broke up with him." Because if they had just left it, we coulda done that research and really used it as—I mean, we don’t need proof. We know they fucked, but—
Jenny: Well, maybe the only other girl who ever broke up with him was Faith.
NOTES: [Kristin laughs]
Hrishi: I feel like somehow the sexual tension award is gonna be given to—[laughs] it’s gonna entirely be happening off screen. [laughing] Like, everything about it is—a lot of off-screen—
Jenny: This is a great…[laughs]
Kristin: I can’t even believe that Faith might be in the fucking running, here in Season 7, Episode 7—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Great point, Hrishi.
Hrishi: [simultaneously] Yeah. [Jenny and Hrishi laugh]
Kristin: It’s remarkable what happens. You know, you can never predict it.
Hrishi: [simultaneously] Yeah, being brought up by a character off-screen—[laughter] about a character off-screen. [laughter]
Jenny: Whew!
Kristin: Yes. And Scott Hope has come out. Congratulations, Scott. So glad.
Jenny: Congrats, Scott.
Kristin: Yeah. Um. Wow, wow. Jenny, whew! That’s exciting.
Hrishi: Maybe it’s like when you get a dog and then you suggest to everybody that they should get a dog. He’s like, I—[laughter] there’s a rumor maybe that she was gay. And then he came out. And just…you know.
Kristin: He just wanted everybody to be gay.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: Just like him.
Jenny: [laughs] Just manifested—be the gay you want to see in the world, as I always say. [Hrishi laughs]
Kristin: Ahh, now there’s a T-shirt.
Jenny: Mmm. [laughs]
Kristin: So…Buffy’s not hearing her cell phone ring because she’s busy being psychoanalyzed by Holden Webster. And Dawn is the other end. This is when shit starts to get real rough at the Summers household. Dawn’s like—
Jenny: Noooo.
Kristin: Picking glass out of her feet. Joyce is, like, manifesting on the couch behind her, but like, Dawn doesn’t see it. We, the viewer, just see it. The lights are off, the lights go on. This is some Poltergeist shit. The first Poltergeist—Jenny, have you seen the Poltergeist films?
Jenny: Not since I was a kid.
Kristin: The first Poltergeist—
Hrishi: [simultaneously] The best time. As—
Jenny: [laughing] Yeah.
Hrishi: [laughing] As the filmmakers intended. [laughter]
Kristin: I’m assuming—Hrishi, I didn’t even ask you, ‘cause—yeah.
Jenny: [simultaneously] [laughs] Yeah. Poltergeist is the one with the horrifying—the horrifying clown doll…
Kristin: Yeah…
Jenny: Thing, right?
Kristin: Wait, Hrishi, have you seen it?
Jenny: [simultaneously] And TV static.
Hrishi: Poltergeist?
Kristin: Yeah.
Hrishi: No. It’s one of those movies that, like, I think I’ve heard so many kids in school telling me about, to—
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Hrishi: Scare everybody that I feel like I’ve seen it.
Kristin: Yeah. It’s pretty fucking—
Jenny: [simultaneously] [laughs] Yeah.
Hrishi: Before there was Wikipedia. [laughter] You know—
Kristin: There were kids talking.
Hrishi: [simultaneously] There was Anthony Provanzano telling me at recess about—[laughter] how he gets to see R-rated movies.
Kristin: Well, one of the, like, most [Jenny laughs] delightful scenes, I think—’cause it’s pretty rough and pretty scary and it terrified me as a young person, but I loved it. But one of the most delightful scenes is, like, Carol Anne? I believe is her name—the little tiny blond girl who’s, like, the centerpiece of Poltergeist. And there’s a little while where she’s, like, interacting with the ghost. And she’s, like, learned how to, like, have the ghost drag the chair with, like, her sitting by it, or drags her whole self. And she’s having a blast and her mom is like—
Hrishi: Mmm.
Kristin: "The fuck is happening."
Hrishi: Hm.
Kristin: Anyway, so this chairs piled up shit? That’s, like, a direct pull from Poltergeist. This happens…like this, except for we don’t get to see the poltergeist drag Dawn across the floor, [laughter] while she’s like, weee! [laughter]
Jenny: Also, I think it’s really interesting that they make the choice for when Dawn’s back is to the couch and we get a flash of Joyce on the couch, just as she was in The Body. I think it’s very interesting that, like, Dawn never saw Joyce.
Kristin: Ugh. Right.
Jenny: On the couch, right? But they’ve, like, gone to great lengths to make sure that she’s positioned just as she was when she died.
Kristin: Hm.
Jenny: And I feel like that’s just something I wanna stick a little pin into, because like—
Kristin: Okay.
Jenny: Who’s doing this?
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: What are they up to?
Hrishi: [simultaneously] That was the single worst—single worst detail of this entire episode for me. [Jenny exhales] That Joyce detail.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Yeah. Yeah. It’s…we…[laughing] haven’t we…didn’t we already watch The Body—
Hrishi: Yes.
Jenny: And endure it and its aftermath?
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah. Yeah. Actually, yeah, that’s interesting though, Jenny. I didn’t even really think about it. And a big question to all of us is, who—yeah, what is happening in this episode? We don’t know yet.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Jenny: Does anybody know what color mother’s milk is?
Kristin: I do! I do, I do! I do, I do, I do.
Jenny: Today?
Kristin: It’s red. It’s red, today, it’s r—yesterday it was blue.
Jenny: Oh.
Kristin: Tomorrow, I think it’s green? But today? That shit’s red.
Jenny: Uhhh. This is…funny? [laughter]
Kristin: I hate it.
Jenny: This "mother’s milk is red today" on the wall.
Kristin: I mean, it’s funny.
Jenny: It feels a little more, like, cartoonish, I think, than the rest of this scene. But maybe that’s good. Maybe it’s, like, a little bit of weird levity, or something.
Kristin: [makes disapproving sound] Kristin gives it a thumb’s down. I mean, I think it’s hysterical. I laughed for, like, 20 minutes when I saw it. But it’s just—to me, everything else—the Poltergeist-y chairs, later we get the slashes in, like—
Hrishi: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Dawn’s flesh, which is very, like, Nightmare on Elm Street, Exorcist shit. Like, it just felt all really, like, deliciously horror.
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: [simultaneously] So I was a little bummed about the choice for this, except for that I got to laugh. [Hrishi laughs] Dawn screams "stop it, stop it, stop it" in the exact cadence as "get out, get out, get out" in this scene. [laughs] Which I like.
Jenny: And it’s very effective. It’s—poltergeists are terrified—
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Of Dawn’s shriek, as they should be, as are we.
Kristin: Yeah. And this is, I think, really effective. Once, for like—Dawn—so the reason I like Dawn—I mean, there are many reasons. But this is very—this is, like, thinking on your feet. You know? Like, she’s terrified. There’s all this shit happening around her. And she’s like, how can I decode the horror? Once for yes, twice for no. And this is awful. "Mom." Once. "Mom, it’s you." Once. "Are you okay?" Twice.
Hrishi: Ugh!
Kristin: No. Bad. Bad, bad bad.
Jenny: Bad. Bad!
Hrishi: Horrible.
Kristin: I’m sorry, Hrishi. You covered your eyes [laughter] and I’m just describing it in complete detail for you. I apologize.
Jenny: We also get Dawn delivering, just as Buffy did—
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: The "mommy." Just as Buffy did in The Body.
Kristin: Yeah. "Mom. Mommy." [sighs]
Jenny: No.
Kristin: But then, right before you get too upset, she says, "Are you alone?" And then the entire house is, like, full earthquake shaking, after we hear the two bangs that say no. I’m not fucking alone. I don’t know who’s here with me, but it’s bad news for everyone. Weeee! [laughs] [singsong] Ta-da!
Jenny: Um. [laughs] A pleasant vacation from what’s going on at the Summers house. Over at Sunnydale High School, Jonathan Mission-Impossibles [Kristin laughs] down into the library and then Andrew comes flying down from the heavens.
Kristin: [laughing] It’s good shit.
Jenny: Like a real dingdong. [laughter] Thereafter, the Seal of Danzalthar! [Kristin laughs] Question mark?
Kristin: Who knows?
Jenny: Dot-dot-dot.
Kristin: Put it in your Shanshu prophecies—
Jenny: Yes.
Kristin: Or whatever we call it over here in this universe. This is cute. "Maybe we should tell Buffy. We need proof. And then we’ll tell her, and then we’ll join her gang, and [laughing] maybe we’ll get to hang out at her house." [laughter] They just wanna hang out with the cool kids. [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah…[laughs] it’s not gonna happen for Jonathan.
Hrishi: Oh, Jonathan.
Kristin: [simultaneously] No. Jonathan, the only good member of the Trio. I mean, there are no good members of the Trio, really. But like, Jonathan! Like, he was really, like, the only one who wasn’t inherently bad?
Jenny: He’s teetering on the edge.
Hrishi: [simultaneously] I feel like Jonathan was turning the corner, in this episode.
Kristin: Right?
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Yes.
Jenny: Yeah.
Hrishi: You know—
Kristin: And he, like—he helped Buffy back when the Trio was all active. He’s the one, like, that told him [sic] how to smash Warren’s balls, you know? Like. [Jenny laughs] He’s always had, like—he’s had the biggest conscience, the whole time—
Hrishi: Yes.
Kristin: And has been closest to turning the whole time. And I think you’re right. I think this was, like, the moment that he was gonna…[sighs] finally do, like, the right thing.
Hrishi: Yeah. That is why—he’s one of my favorite characters because of that ambiguity. And yeah, in this moment, it really felt like, oh, he’s coming—he’s coming back, he’s turning it around. And—and this is gonna be a new chapter for him. And could actually be, like, a really powerful ally, the way he has been from time to time.
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Yeah.
Hrishi: But, alas.
Kristin: Yeah. I would have really liked that.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: For many reasons.
Hrishi: Especially since redemption is obviously a huge theme in this show. It would be nice to see Jonathan get—have a little bit of it. And I think, in some ways, they do give him a little bit of it, even in these little moments. Just hearing this bit of dialogue from him, it is a way of giving him his own kind of—you know, we get to witness that maybe he is redeemed, even if it’s not in actions, with the Scoobs.
Kristin: Yeah, that’s actually really powerful.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Yeah.
Kristin: Because—I mean, you’re talking about sort of when he’s saying, "It doesn’t matter if they care about me. What matters is that I—that, like, I care about—I don’t care if they care about me."
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: "I care about them."
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: And so thinking about that as, like, a path for us to see, like, his redemption or whatever you wanna call it is really powerful, I think. Because, like, that kind of is it, you know? It’s like, when you’re doing the thing—when you’re doing the right thing because you want to do the right thing, and it doesn’t matter who sees it. It doesn’t matter who knows it, you’re doing it because you wanna do it and because it feels right to do it.
Hrishi: Mmhmm.
Kristin: That is powerful. So maybe I’m not—I mean, RIP Jonathan. But—so that’s really beautiful.
Hrishi: I also thought there was something really interesting about what he said in this episode, in conjunction with the title, with Conversations with Dead People. Because though he is still alive in the moments while he’s saying it, what he says sounded so much to me the way that a benevolent ghost might speak.
Kristin: Mmm!
Hrishi: Where he’s like, I just want to see them—
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Hrishi: I just wanna be around them, I just wanna know they’re okay. You know, I just—
Kristin: Oh, wow.
Hrishi: [simultaneously] It doesn’t matter if they see me or they care about me. Like, just to be a—sort of a presence and a force for good in some kind of—or whatever, a witness. I don’t know, he sounded—it sounded like he was speaking the lines of a ghost.
Kristin: That gave me—like, when I first understood what you were saying, I got full body chills. So. Good job, and yes. [Hrishi laughs] Oof.
Jenny: When Hrishi and I were talking, working on the song together, we were talking about that section of Jonathan. And Kristin, I feel like this might be up your alley. When Hrishi made that observation, it made me think of…the goodbye monologue in Our Town.
Kristin: Mmmm.
Jenny: When Emily is saying goodbye to things, clocks ticking and mama’s sunflowers and coffee and food. And she’s talking [Kristin groans] to her dead mother and telling her that she is de—like, that whole thing. That sort of, like, address—it feels like simultaneously highly personal and also, like, very kind of…broad and—
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Widely embracing, or something?
Hrishi: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Yeah. Yeah.
Jenny: In that same way.
Hrishi: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Does everyone—like, everyone who knows Our Town who’s listening to this podcast, like, did you all think "clocks ticking" first? ‘Cause I did. And then you said "clocks ticking" first. So I’m just wondering if that’s, like, the thing that we remember [Jenny laughs] in the dialogue. But you’re right, that is up my alley for many reasons. I was in Our Town. I’m obsessed with My So Called Life and my favorite character Rayanne Graff played Emily in the production of Our Town, so. It has many, many roots for me. But yeah, I totally agree. It’s really beautiful. It’s almost like the two of you, like, write lyrics to songs or some shit, you know?
NOTES: [laughter]
Jenny: Well! [clears throat]
Hrishi: I don’t think we talked about this, Jenny, at the time when we were writing. But it reminds me a little bit of the first song that we ever wrote together, for a song of mine, the first song that we wrote after Hush.
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Hrishi: Which was about…which is called Memory Palace, which hasn’t come out yet. But that song is about Sandra Day O’Connor and the letter that she wrote—she wrote this open letter in October 2018—
Jenny: [quietly] Mmhmm.
Hrishi: Saying that she had Alzheimer’s and as a result, she was gonna retreat from public life. And it’s—
Jenny: [whispers] Yeah.
Hrishi: Incredibly moving. I found it really moving and beautiful and heartbreaking that she was sort of taking a moment to kind of say goodbye to people and then basically announcing that she was gonna disappear. Even though she hadn’t—
Jenny: Yeah.
Hrishi: In a way, it felt like…I don’t know. It reminded me a little bit of this Our Town goodbye too.
Kristin: Wow.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: It’s like, I both want to hear this song and I want to never hear this song.
Jenny: Yeah. [laughter] Yep!
Hrishi: Well, it’ll be out in March. Memory Palace featuring Jenny Owen Youngs.
Kristin: Oh, gosh.
Jenny: Aw, yeah.
Kristin: [simultaneously] Will you be playing it on your tour? Because then I might be forced to listen to it.
Hrishi: We are gonna play it.
Jenny: Yes.
Hrishi: Yeah, yeah.
Kristin: Great. See you in Saugerties.
Jenny: Oh, yes.
Kristin: [simultaneously] I’ll be the one crying in the corner. [laughter] Oh my goodness. So. Essentially, we’ve talked a lot about what’s going to happen. But Warren, we have not talked about. And Warren, even though I would much prefer if Jonathan was, like, the ghost of himself and we didn’t have to deal with Warren. But he’s here. And…he’s, like, going hard on the Andrew crush shit. I just don’t have room for it, you know? Like, for Andrew, I mean. Like, I wanna be like, well, like, Andrew’s struggling with, like, his sexuality and his feelings. But mm, nah. This is too bad. This shit he does here is too bad, I don’t care if you’re gay. Man, figure your shit out. But—
Jenny: Yes, no murdering, even if you’re gay!
Kristin: [laughing] Even if you’re gay, yes! [laughter] But he’s essentially telling Andrew that he’s more powerful now that he’s been killed. And that, like, all that—he just has to do this shit with Jonathan and then the two of them, Andrew and Warren, will be gods together. And Andrew fucking believes it and whatever.
Hrishi: Hmm.
Jenny: Yeah—
Kristin: [simultaneously] Oh cool, let’s go cry in the fucking library some more.
NOTES: [laughter]
Jenny: Oh, no. This—um, this reveal from Cassie that Tara can’t appear directly to Willow because Willow killed people? [groans]
Kristin: And it’s like, you as the viewer obviously are like, stop! Like, clearly there’s something wrong here. Clearly. But like, if you are the person who is Willow who has killed a person. Like, her own shit is too big to even, like, think that this might not be Tara at this point. And it’s awful. And she’s like, "She’s talking to you and she can hear me?" Which I almost made a joke, and then I didn’t make the joke ‘cause it’s a really serious scene. But I was thinking, like, maybe Willow has seen the movie Ghost and she’s like, I know how this rolls. [laughter] Like, we’ll make out later, we’ll make some—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Let’s get to the pottery studio immediately!
Kristin: [simultaneously] Pottery later and it’ll get really sexy.
Jenny: To the kiln! [laughter] Yeah, you know…they’re just expressing that they miss each other. It’s, like, particularly rough when Willow says, "Every day, it’s like this giant hole and it’s not getting better." And then Cassie references this "strong like an Amazon"—
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: Thing. That Tara and Willow have said to each other, previously. And I’m like—knowing what happens later in the episode—where is, air quotes, "Cassie" getting her intel?
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: Right.
Jenny: How does she know this?!
Kristin: Right, right.
Hrishi: Whoever is doing this knows exactly where to press. You know, exactly the—
Kristin: Yes.
Hrishi: Pain point for everyone, simultaneously, in all of their minds. [laughs]
Kristin: Yeah. Yeah. [Jenny laughs] Whoever’s doing this shit is powerful. When you said that—when you sort of brought up the part of the quote where Willow says, like, "It’s like this giant hole and it’s not getting better." It just reminded me of this graphic that I saw recently about grief. Which—I don’t know, it moved me because it was sort of like, a lot of people think that across time, grief gets smaller and, like, in the graphic, it’s sort of like, there’s two circles. One’s inside of each other. It’s kind of like the diagram of you and Hrishi.
Jenny: Nice. [Hrishi laughs]
Kristin: And in the diagram as it progresses, the grief is, like, the smaller circle and and it’s just getting smaller and smaller and smaller. And then it—in the next line, it’s like, but in reality, it’s really, like, life that gets larger. Like, the grief is—the grief itself, the feeling of loss, the—that doesn’t get smaller. It’s just that your life then gets better around it—
Hrishi: Mmm.
Kristin: So you’re not…you know.
Jenny: Ah.
Kristin: Hitting it as often. You know, it’s just not as present, but when you hit it, it’s always as big as it was. Which—
Jenny: Wow.
Kristin: Just resonated for me.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Jenny: Ow.
Hrishi: I like that.
Kristin: [simultaneously] Sorry.
Hrishi: I like it.
Kristin: Everyone.
Hrishi: I think it’s good.
Kristin: Well—
Hrishi: I mean, I think that’s a hopeful statement.
Kristin: Yeah.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Because it’s like—because I also think that part of grief is being afraid that you will forget. You know? And like, that—like, you don’t wanna be in pain but you also don’t wanna not be in pain.
Hrishi: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Because what would that mean? And so I agree. I—it was really powerful for me to read and to see.
Jenny: Okay. Now I’m watching this podcast through my fingers. What the fuck?
NOTES: [laughter]
Kristin: Okay! Okay, okay, okay. Well, lucky for you, Jenny—
Jenny: Ow!
Kristin: We’re at The Bronze. [Hrishi laughs] And fucking Spike is sitting at the bar and a blond just fucking rolls a pack of cigarettes on the bar. So. How do you like them apples?
Jenny: My dude. Justine Junior.
Kristin: [laughs] Noo!
Jenny: I don’t know—have you seen—have you ever seen Angel, Hrishi?
Hrishi: Uhh, I watched a little bit when—you know, in—when it crossed—when the streams crossed with Buffy.
Jenny: Oh, okay, okay, okay.
Hrishi: But not for the standalone—
Kristin: [simultaneously] Have you ever seen The L Word, Hrishi? [laughs]
Hrishi: [laughing] No. [laughter]
Kristin: But what if you had? This would have been such an exciting moment for all of us here in this space.
Hrishi: Oh. [laughter] Man.
Jenny: There is a woman who is briefly—who has, like, a—I don’t know. Like, a one-season arc on Angel. She’s an antagonist, and she’s played by an actress who is one of the main characters on the original L Word.
Hrishi: Mmm.
Jenny: Who, like, if you watched The L Word—Hrishi, if you were a good lesbian and you watched The L Word. [laughter]
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: You would hate her character. She’s everyone’s least favorite character, and then she’s on Angel for a season and she’s everyone’s least favorite [laughter] character on Angel. And this—
Kristin: Also, her name on The L Word is Tina, and her name on Angel is Justine. So.
Jenny: So, Justina, if you will.
Kristin: Justina.
Jenny: Basically, this woman that Spike is going home with—
Hrishi: Mmhmm.
Jenny: In this episode has a very similar visual vibe. So it just—it’s just a lot of hatred being fueled. That’s all. Just—
Kristin: Okay.
Jenny: Just getting you on our level.
Kristin: So you’re happy—
Hrishi: [simultaneously] But it’s not the actual same actress?
Kristin: No. It is not. It is not.
Jenny: No, no. Just a—
Kristin: I would have lost it, completely, entirely, if it was. It could—it could be, though! That bitch is still alive. She didn’t die. She could be fucking strolling around Sunnydale. [Jenny laughs] Now that woulda been some fucking funny shit!
Jenny: [simultaneously] No, but this is just some approximation.
Kristin: Imagine if Justine left Los Angeles, rolled into Sunnydale and then, after all—living through a whole season of Angel where everyone hated her, she died ‘cause Spike fucking bit her. That would have been—oh! Chef’s fucking kiss. That would have been gorgeous.
Jenny: That would have been nice.
Kristin: I would have loved it.
Jenny: Well. [laughter] Alright, time to go to therapy. Have either of you ever laid down on a couch in a therapeutic setting?
Kristin: A talking—is that what they call it? A talking couch? What do they call this couch? It has a name.
Jenny: Sure, a talking couch, sounds great.
Kristin: [laughs] No, I’ve never laid down at therapy. Ever. Hrishi?
Hrishi: Uhh, I have to say, one time, I did. [Jenny gasps] I was extremely tired. It was, like, some moment in life when things were very, very, very hectic. And I was with Lindsay, and I was just like, "You can do some talk—" and I was really tired. [Kristin laughs] And with permission of the therapist and Lindsay, I just kind of went horizontal for a bit during a moment while she was sort of doing most of the talking.
Jenny: Did it change your therapy experience at all?
Hrishi: Um, I mean, I didn’t have to—[laughs] I didn’t have to stay upright [laughter] in a moment where I physically felt like I could not. So. [laughter] It was good. I think it did, because it—you know, it was—it was a kind move by everyone towards me. And—
Kristin: Mmm.
Jenny: Mmm.
Hrishi: I think the idea of, like—well, certainly, it isn’t probably the first time that kindness had ever existed in a therapy session. But it was a really [Jenny laughs] overt way of demonstrating that kindness?
Kristin: Mmm.
Hrishi: And I think that—
Jenny: Yeah.
Hrishi: That makes a difference.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Oh, yeah.
Kristin: [laughing] Should we all lay down for the rest of the podcast? [Hrishi laughs]
Jenny: I think that would be best.
Kristin: As an act of kindness for each other. [laughter]
Jenny: Have you ever laid down on top of someone else’s tomb? [Hrishi laughs] For any reason? In any setting?
Hrishi: Not yet.
Kristin: I mean, this would have been the kind of shit I would have done in high school. You know?
Jenny: Sure, yeah.
Kristin: With my fucking goth boots and shit. I didn’t, but I would have—had been—had I been given the option.
Hrishi: [simultaneously] Right after you microwaved a marshmallow.
Kristin: [laughing] Yeah.
Jenny: [laughing] Yeah.
Kristin: No, it’s like, eighth grade: microwave marshmallow. Tenth grade: lie on crypt—
Hrishi: [simultaneously] I see, okay, okay, yeah. Yeah.
Kristin: [simultaneously] With Doc Marten boots. [Hrishi laughs] You know, like, that’s the—[laughs]
Jenny: One feature that I really like about this ongoing conversation between Buffy and Holden is that, because he’s someone she has a context for—like, a personal context for, and he’s also a vampire—a state of being that Buffy has a lot of knowledge about, she is able to have the compassion and the information to explain to him that his face is changing and that that’s something he can do and, like, when it happens. And then she teaches him the word "sire." Like, I think that is really fun. It’s just a fun piece of this ongoing thing.
Hrishi: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Yeah. That’s what I—I mean, when I was like, I think that there are parts of the writing of this that I think are really good. And like, the sire…seed. [laughs] I couldn’t think of a better way to say it, but.
Jenny: Mmm.
Kristin: Sorry about that, everyone.
Jenny: Mmhmm!
Kristin: But like, the fact that we learn—like, the fact that it’s just woven in that he says "vampify" and she says "sire." But then that becomes really, like, one of the biggest pieces of the puzzle for why this guy is here. I just thought that was done very, very well.
Jenny: And smoothly. Like, you don’t feel it coming, especially because it was preceded by, like, the face change and stuff.
Kristin: Yeah. Yeah. It just—like, that part all works for me. But…it’s bad enough, I think, to—I’m just gonna say this, and like, we don’t have to talk about it. But like, it’s bad enough for me that this vampire dude named—what is his name? Holden?
Hrishi: Webbin’ holsters.
Jenny: Holden Webster!
Kristin: Webbin’ holsters. [Jenny laughs] Holden Websters. The fact that, like, this dude is like, "oh, let me tell you all about the inside of your mind." [Hrishi laughs] [Jenny groans] Even if he’s correct about some of that shit, is like, upsetting on its face. But then, knowing that this is the scene that Joss wrote and that he is writing this, like, examination of Buffy’s psyche was too much for me! [Hrishi laughs] No thank you. Goodnight.
Jenny: I think it is useful in the same way that so many scenarios within—well, the entire scenario of Once More, with Feeling was useful. That people were saying things that they could not have otherwise been able to say to one another. Here, Buffy is allowed to say things so that we can hear her and so that she can hear herself, that she wouldn’t be able to say to any of the people who are important in her life.
Hrishi: Right.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: It just feels a little…clunky.
Hrishi: But I mean, any other scenario—like you said. The things that you want her to express in any other setting would be even more clunky.
Kristin: Yeah. She couldn’t.
Jenny: It’s true.
Kristin: [simultaneously] She couldn’t. She couldn’t say that—
Hrishi: [simultaneously] What are you gonna do, a voiceover? A letter that she’s writing to some—you know—
Kristin: [laughs] Passion.
Jenny: [laughing] "Dear Angel."
Hrishi: [laughs] Yeah. Exactly.
Kristin: [laughs] Yeah.
Jenny: No, no, it’s like an over-the-shoulder, she’s typing an email.
Hrishi: Right. Right. Right, right. [laughs]
Kristin: Yeah, no, and that’s why this whole situation, it really is—it’s a both/and for—both/and? It’s—whatever. It’s like, I both really appreciate it for certain reasons and really, really have a very bad taste in my mouth about it for others.
Hrishi: Mm.
Jenny: Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin: But. We do get some insights into Buffy. Ehh, I don’t know which ones we want to pick up and which ones we want to put down. But in this scene, we’re talking about her parents’ divorce.
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Her feelings about that. She’s mad—and the thing about it is, like, she’s upset and she wants to, like, stop talking. But then she can’t stop talking because of what you said, Hrishi. Right, that like, she knows on some level that she can keep talking. This is the one situation where she knows she’s gonna dust this guy at the end, so she can say fucking anything.
Hrishi: Mmhmm. Hey, I wanna go back for—[laughing] for one second. Just go back to the image of Kristin and her Doc Martens. [laughter] Do the two of you watch Bob’s Burgers?
Kristin: I’ve seen, like, a good chunk of the episodes. I don’t, like, watch it—you know—in order, as a show, but I have seen much of it.
Jenny: Yeah, I’ve seen a lot, but I’m not totally up to speed.
Hrishi: Well, there was an episode from earlier this year—January 2022 episode—where Bob and Linda are considering whether or not to be buried or cremated after death. [laughter] And Bob is in favor of being buried, Linda is in favor of being cremated.
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Hrishi: And they’re sort of arguing the points back and forth. And there’s one moment where—that made me really laugh, when Bob says—you know, he’s saying, "Cemeteries are nice. They can be peaceful." And he’s like, you know—or like, under an oak tree, it’s like a picnic spot. It’s us having a forever picnic. And Linda says, "Yeah but cemeteries can be haunted or worse, we end up with a bunch of goth punks hanging out on Halloween, [Kristin laughs] sitting on our tombstones, smoking cigarettes and making out."
Kristin: [laughing] Yes.
Jenny: [laughs] Hell yeah!
Kristin: Oh my god…
Hrishi: [simultaneously] And then she looked directly into the camera and said, "Kristin."
Kristin: Yep. [laughter] And I was just, like, staring back with my clove—it was probably a clove cigarette.
Hrishi: [laughs] Right, yeah, of course.
Kristin: Like, mmhmm, you got it right. [laughs] Oh, wow. I could hear Bob say, "It’s like a picnic forever." [Hrishi laughs] Like, I could hear him say it when you said that. [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Alright, so. Moving along, I think, from this. Because then he hits her with a statue.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: He, like, gets her to open up, he picks up a cemetery statue. He clocks her. We go to a commercial. And we come back, and they’re fighting, when we come back. Right? Like, we get a little bit more of this scene. We see that she is—comes to and they fight a bit? [pause] Sure, great, good talk. [laughter] So, anyway. We go to the scene that Hrishi is really covering his eyes for. [Hrishi laughs] At the Summers house, ‘cause this is where we get the flashes. And I hear you, I see her, and the—it’s all happening, Hrishi. It’s—we’re here, we’ve arrived.
Jenny: Ugh.
Hrishi: The one escape pod for me out of the horror of this scene was when the—[laughs] when the voice says, "get out." I immediately flashed to Eddie Murphy. I’m gonna—can I play you something? For the two of you?
Kristin: Please.
Jenny: Oh, yes.
NOTES: [Clip of Eddie Murphy’s Delirious plays]
Eddie: I was watching Poltergeist last month. [applause] I got a question. Why don’t white people just leave the house when there’s a ghost in the house? [applause and laughter] Y’all stay in the house too fucking long. Get
the fuck out the house. [Jenny and Kristin laugh] Very simple: there’s a ghost in the house, get the fuck out. [crowd laughs] And not only do they stay in the motherfucking house in Poltergeist, they invited more white people over. [laughter] Sit around going, "Our daughter Carol Anne’s in the television set." I woulda been gone. If I had a daughter, been down at the precinct saying, "Look, man, I went home and my fucking daughter’s in the TV set and shit so I just fucking left. [crowd laughs] You can have all that shit, I ain’t going back to the motherfucker now. I just came down so when she ain’t at the school, you don’t think I killed the bitch or nothin’ like that. But she is inside the TV set, you can have all that shit. Fuck it." [crowd laughs] "Uh, Mr. Murphy, didn’t you try to save your daughter?" "I’m a man and shit, I tried to save her. I turned the channel, the shit didn’t work, I got the fuck out." [laughter] Leave! The kid was only six years old in the movie, they couldn’t have been too attached to her. [laughter] Leave! In Amityville Horror, the ghost told them to get out the house. White people stayed in there. Now that’s a hint and a half for your ass. [laughter] A ghost say "get the fuck out," I would just tip the fuck out the door. [laughter] They walked and looked in the toilet bowl, was blood in the toilet. And they said, "That’s peculiar." [laughter] I woulda been in the house and said, "Oh, baby, this is beautiful. We got a chandelier hanging up here, kids outside playing, it’s a beautiful neighborhood. We ain’t got nothing to worry—I really love it, this is really nice." [whispers] "Get! Out!" "Too bad we can’t stay, baby." [laughter and applause]
NOTES: [Jenny, Kristin and Hrishi laughing]
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: A perfect clip. I mean, he even said Carol Anne. I don’t—
Hrishi: [simultaneously] He even talked about—yeah.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: The listeners couldn’t see my face—
Jenny: Amazing.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: But I got real excited when he confirmed—[Jenny laughs]
Hrishi: Yes.
Kristin: Eddie Murphy confirmed for me [laughter] that her name was in fact Carol Anne.
Hrishi: Yep.
Kristin: A twist I didn’t see coming. [laughter]
Hrishi: Too bad we can’t stay.
Kristin: Yeah, Dawn does not get the fuck out. [Jenny laughs] She literally, like, takes it to the next level and, like, turns on her heel and is like, "Actually? No."
NOTES: [laughter]
Hrishi: By the way, the movie Get Out is a reference to that bit.
Kristin: Really!
Hrishi: Yeah.
Jenny: Wow!
Hrishi: Yeah, from Delirious. [laughs]
Kristin: Cool.
Jenny: Holy shit.
Kristin: So, Hrishi. You covered your eyes but you saw enough to know that this was very scary.
Hrishi: Uh-huh.
Kristin: We get, like, this sort of all-black—
Hrishi: I mean, I covered my—you know. I watched—I’m still watching. I was just—
Kristin: You’re like, don’t—say it. Don’t. I saw it, don’t say it. [laughter]
Hrishi: Yeah, yeah. [laughter]
Kristin: Okay, it’s scary. The lights are flashing, it’s scary, it’s scary, it’s scary. Dawn does the exact thing that Eddie Murphy said she would do. And she says, "No. She’s my mother. And I’m staying."
Hrishi: This is a flip of the—[laughs] "she was only six years old, how attached could you be?" Because really, how attached could—[laughter] how attached could she be to Joyce? I mean, she only just started existing. [laughter]
Kristin: She’s only two seasons old. [laughter]
Hrishi: Exactly.
Kristin: How attached could we be to her? [laughs]
Hrishi: She has no backstory. [laughter]
Kristin: Oh, lord. Alright.
Jenny: Andrew and Jonathan, they’re lost in the basement. Warren appears with his creepy stare to show Andrew which door to go through. They go in, they start digging. Ba-ba-duh!
Kristin: At the cemetery, more psych shit. "Are you killing me because I’m evil or because you opened up?" Kill this vampire! Why are you letting him keep talking? I hate him so much. [laughs]
Jenny: The worst thing—[laughs] yeah, she—I wrote, "she kicks him in the face which is exactly what I would have done." [laughter]
Kristin: Yeah. [laughs]
Jenny: Buffy, like, says all this stuff where she’s like, "oh, with you vampires it’s all, like, blood and lust and sex and death and it’s all one thing. Believe me, I would know." She basically says—
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: "I have dated some vampires." And then, diabolical mastermind Holden Webster [laughter] is like, "I’m going to ask you something," puffing on his pipe, [Kristin laughs] adjusting his little Sherlock Holmes hat. "And if I get it right, you have to tell me anything I wanna know. Was your last relationship with a vampire?!" [Kristin laughs] As though he’s a genius!
Kristin: Yeah.
Hrishi: Okay—
Jenny: This is his worst crime, to me. [laughs]
Hrishi: I don’t know enough about the world to know if this is true, but…[Jenny laughs] this broey douchebag…
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Hrishi: I’m surprised that he was a psych major. To the extent that any personality types map to specific majors.
Kristin: Interesting. But like, if you were a dude who wanted to explain everything…[Hrishi laughs] to everyone—
Jenny: Like, everything.
Hrishi: Uh-huh.
Kristin: Like, really—like, really just, like—
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: "You think you know yourself, but I actually know you," then it…checks.
NOTES: [laughs]
Hrishi: Well, no, then all you have to really do is listen to a couple podcasts.
NOTES: [laughter]
Kristin: As I said it, I was like, actually, I guess they just do that.
Hrishi: Yeah, exactly.
Kristin: They don’t need a degree. [laughter] There’s one little aside in this scene that I just wanna note, ‘cause it gave me a chuckle, where he says, "Oh my god." And then he’s like, "By the way, what’s the deal on that?" And she’s like—Buffy goes, "Nothing solid." [Jenny laughs] I just love, like—you know, we’re on a Hellmouth. We’re like, is this, like, a—what’s happening here? And it’s like, we’re not sure, we’re not sure. [Hrishi laughs] Demons—
Jenny: Might as well check in, if anybody has the hot god goss. [laughter]
Kristin: Hot gods? So in the library, Willow is telling Tara via Cassie what happened at the end of Season 6. She’s like, here, let me just play you a few episodes. This is what happened after you died. [laughter] I got real mad. I flayed a guy. He—
Jenny: So veiny, black hair, black eyes.
Kristin: [laughs] Giles, like, came with all the magic, he gave me all the magic, it was crazy. And then Xander saved everything ‘cause of a yellow crayon. End scene.
NOTES: [laughs]
Jenny: Yay! And Cassie’s like, "You simply can’t use magic again, not ever." Well, this is interesting. This is interesting. [laughs]
Kristin: Yeah, a little ham—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Willow’s like, "Well, sure, like, evil magic, I definitely shouldn’t use, right?"
Kristin: I feel like Cassie—whoever this is, whatever this is—I feel like was really subtle at first, you know?
Hrishi: Yes.
Kristin: And they just went a little too hard, a little—[laughter]
Hrishi: She tipped her hand.
Kristin: [laughing] Yeah, she really did.
Jenny: Yeah, and then just kept tipping.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: She was like, "So, you’re—so now that you understand, don’t ever use magic again and maybe you should kill yourself. Okay, no?"
Hrishi: [simultaneously] And maybe you should kill yourself, yeah.
Kristin: [laughs] Yeah, and—
Hrishi: [simultaneously] And she’s like, "And this is from Tara?"
Kristin: [laughing] Yeah.
Jenny: [laughing] Yeah.
Hrishi: There is a more—I mean, I think there’s a more subtle—you know, she could have continued down the subtle path [Kristin laughs] to a more effective and evil version of that destination, you know?
Kristin: Yes.
Hrishi: Where it’s like, oh, she wants to be with you and you two belong together and think about the—you know.
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Hrishi: Infinity, et cetera.
Kristin: Yeah. Yeah. Think about the forever picnic in the cemetery. [laughs]
Hrishi: Yes, exactly! Exactly! [laughter]
Jenny: Ohh. We could be singing on a bridge together forever!
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah. [laughs] But yeah, this is another—we get—there’s a lot of, like, real cliff-hangy commercial breaks. ‘Cause this one is Cassie saying, "She says you’re not gonna be okay! You’re gonna kill everybody." And then it’s like, McDonald’s ad, or whatever happened in the year 2002.
Hrishi: No, no, there were McDonald’s. Then. [Jenny laughs]
Kristin: There were—McDonald’s existed then?
Hrishi: Yeah. [laughter]
Jenny: Yeah, but what were they up to? What was McDonald’s—
Kristin: [simultaneously] 2002?
Jenny: [simultaneously] What was their angle in 2002?
Hrishi: They might have just unveiled the Justin Timberlake, Pusha T, ba-da-ba-ba-ba I’m lovin’ it jingle.
Jenny: I’m lovin’ it?
Kristin: Holy shit, Hrishi, that was so quick. Like, your brain just did that so fast.
NOTES: [laughter]
Hrishi: Some time around then, right? 2002—
Kristin: Yeah.
Hrishi: 2003?
Kristin: Yeah. The only thing I could think about was that Burger King gave out free fries in, like, ‘96. That was all I could reference and I was like, maybe they were…[Jenny gasps] considering a retaliation, but that’s too many years later.
Jenny: "I’m Lovin’ It" was released as a single on November 20th, 2003. About a year in advance—
Hrishi: [simultaneously] Mm, okay, okay, okay.
Kristin: [simultaneously] Wow.
Jenny: [simultaneously] In the future from this episode.
Hrishi: Got it, got it.
Kristin: That was good.
Hrishi: Cassie can pre-cog the commercial for [laughter]—she’s like, in a year from now, ba-da-ba-ba! [laughter]
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: She’s like, Tara has one other thing that she wants to tell you. [laughter]
Jenny: Mmm.
Kristin: Oh, shit. So we talk—we talked about this scene, with Jonathan and Andrew. And it was very powerful and moving. Yes, Jenny gestured towards someone.
Jenny: But—sure, we talked about the emotional stuff, which is beautiful! But we didn’t talk about that they’ve been very productive in their little dig, and they’ve uncovered the seal. And if Hot Topic sold evil seals—[Hrishi laughs]
Kristin: Right.
Jenny: They would look like this! [laughter]
Kristin: Oh, you’re right. And I would have bought one to wear around my neck.
Jenny: Yeah. Yeah. [laughter]
Kristin: With my boots. [laughs]
Jenny: For your dorm room floor. "Welcome to hell!" [laughter]
Kristin: Last important thing of that scene is just 36-19-27. Which is Jonathan’s locker combination. [laughs] That’s all.
Jenny: Yep. Yep, yep.
Kristin: Just—I don’t know if you’ll need it or not. You won’t need it, but [Jenny laughs] what if you thought you did?
Hrishi: Which is also the number of people alive in Sunnydale, sometime between School Hard and this episode. [laughter]
Kristin: Yes!
Hrishi: No, wait, that’s not right at all—
Kristin: No, ‘cause it—
Hrishi: There’s an extra digit. Damnit! [laughs]
Kristin: Yeah. But I’m still—
Jenny: [simultaneously] No, there’s an enormous population boom. [laughter]
Kristin: It was still worth it, it was still—
Jenny: [simultaneously] That was rapidly squashed.
Kristin: Yeah.
Hrishi: I got excited.
Kristin: It was still worth it.
Hrishi: Okay.
Kristin: Dawn is…using magic dust? I—like, I don’t know where she learned this shit.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Yep. Yep.
Kristin: But she is throwing magic dust. This is the scratch on the cheek. There’s a glass explosion. Things are very intense at the Summers house.
Jenny: Yeah.
Hrishi: Yeah, the cut on the cheek, I think, really makes the fear part of this so much more intense. Because, like Jenny, I was imagining it—that oh, there’s some kind of ghost mirage—
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Hrishi: Happening here and actually, when the haunting is over, everything’s gonna be fine. But here’s actual physical damage happening to…to Dawn.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah, it’s like, the poltergeist, he really picks and chooses. ‘Cause the blood on the wall—splatters—those disappear.
Hrishi: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Dawn is actually very hurt. And sort of—I mean, it really is like A Nightmare on Elm Street kind of a deal, where like—
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: Some of it is dreamy and some of it is—if you don’t wake up in your dreams, you know what they say.
Hrishi: You get to sleep a little longer?
Kristin: Yeah. [laughter] Superiority complex? And an inferiority complex about your superiority—
Jenny: [simultaneously] [sighs] I don’t—
Kristin: Complex.
Jenny: I don’t…
Kristin: Tell me, Jenny.
Jenny: I just…I just! I don’t know. I think, like…
Kristin: Jenny’s doing the Gabagool hands, for those of you who—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Can’t see her.
Jenny: I wanna have room for this idea, because like, I can…I think, see a way in which it could work, maybe, for me? But it just feels like, un…like, undercooked.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Like, it feels like we’re not done making this idea. Like—
Kristin: Yeah.
Hrishi: It reminds me a little bit of Holly Hunter in Broadcast News. Am I just the person who comes on this podcast to talk about other things? [Jenny laughs] I’m sorry.
Kristin: I love it. I wish that I knew more of the things, but I’m not good at knowing things about stuff on TV, as people know. [laughs]
Hrishi: Broadcast News, one of my favorite movies of all time. Holly Hunter plays a brilliant, brilliant producer. She’s so smart. She’s sort of like a grown-up version of Lisa Simpson, or something like that. And at some point, somebody says to her, "God, it must feel so good being right all the time." And she says, "No." And she’s, like, on the verge of tears. She’s like, "No. It feels awful." Or "it’s awful" or something like—it’s—
Kristin: Yeah.
Hrishi: I blew the line. But…
Kristin: No, it—
Hrishi: [simultaneously] It’s very, very good. But it reminds of that, that she’s—that’s what the inferiority complex about the superiority complex reminded me of.
Kristin: Yeah, and I mean, that’s the thing, though. Like, even you just delivering that line that was Holly Hunter’s line hit better than—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: The way that it’s un—and it’s just because it’s this dude—it’s—if Buffy was saying—if Buffy was giving voice to this in a way that felt as cooked, to use Jenny’s terminology, as what you just told us about Holly Hunter—
Hrishi: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Then it would work more for me. But it just—yeah, it just feels…it feels too soon for Buffy to be knowing this about herself. And it feels really obnoxious for this dude to be telling her that this is how she feels? Like, it just—mm.
Hrishi: Yeah, I mean, I think the telling and not showing—
Kristin: Yeah.
Hrishi: Is what makes it so clunky here.
Jenny: Yes! Yes, exactly.
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Hrishi: They could have had a conversation where she revealed this as the underlying sentiment, without just sort of spelling it out.
Jenny: Exactly.
Kristin: [simultaneously] Right, and there’s so much other shit in here, too. ‘Cause I do think that this is probably the most important piece, but she goes back over—we, like, re-mine the, like, "I let him do horrible things to me." Which I fucking—I cannot stand this shit, of like, she had—because she’s always referring to, like, having sex and knocking a house down. And, like, the—non-vanilla sex that she had with Spike. And I—I just heard it enough time—once was more than I wanted to hear it. But again and again and again, with her being like, "I’m bad because, like, I let him do things to me that were not…[laughs] prescribed by our—" it just—it just—we didn’t need any of that. And I agree, if they had spent more time digging into this. ‘Cause it does feel important. But, yeah. Jenny, what were you—
Jenny: I do think that, like, when she talks about, like, what Spike did to her. And like, how she feels fucked up about it after the fact, with regards to fucking the house down and whatnot. I read that more—like, less about, like, oh, we had rough sex and I liked it, or whatever. And like, it wasn’t vanilla and it wasn’t as chaste as sex can be, or whatever. [laughter] And more like…the stuff that she refers to, like…their relationship being about, like, her using him to feel better? And like, not stopping herself from doing that.
Kristin: Okay.
Jenny: You know what I mean?
Kristin: Mmhmm. That makes sense to me.
Jenny: I feel like she feels the worst about her behavior and, like, the way that she feels about it from, like, a moral and ethical standpoint, towards Spike.
Kristin: Okay. I choose that—I would choose that reading over the one that I had. Because I don’t like the one that I had.
Jenny: I mean. Who knows.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: [sarcastically] I mean, I’m just a girl. I’m not a psych major [laughter] from Dartmouth, doing taekwondo. [laughter] So I have really no idea. No footing whatsoever.
Kristin: None. None. This—
Hrishi: [laughs] That is the best bio for this guy, who would have been so awful on Twitter.
Kristin: Ughhh, the worst! Oh, god, thank god he died before Twitter.
Hrishi: [simultaneously] [laughing] Dartmouth alum. Psych major.
Jenny: Yeah.
Hrishi: [laughing] I know taekwondo. [laughter]
Kristin: Well. At the end—as Buffy is talking about all this shit, she says the name of this vampire who she has all these conflicted feelings about.
Jenny: Mmhmm!
Kristin: And he says—[Jenny gasps] "Did you say Spike?"
Jenny: [simultaneously] "Did you say Spike?" [laughter]
Kristin: Cut to a brief shot of Spike outside with this girl, at the bottom of the steps. Will he go home with her or will he not? Oh, spoiler alert, he’ll eat her.
Jenny: I do wanna say…that I really love the music cue they keep using over Spike and Justine Junior. I feel like it’s…
Kristin: So mad.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Unlike anything we’ve heard—
Hrishi: Mmm.
Jenny: In this show. It has this, like, sort of…I don’t know. It’s like, kind of magical? Like, chaotic neutral magical kind of vibe. Would listen.
Kristin: [simultaneously] I don’t even remember, but I’m gonna go back and listen. Yeah. Speaking of things that are magical. [Jenny laughs] This is my favorite Dawn sound clip. I’m not even gonna play it, I’m just gonna do it—no, I’m not gonna do it for you, I’ll play the clip. But she says, "I cast you out. I cast you out into the void!"
NOTES: [laughter]
Hrishi: We don’t need a clip. Come on, that’s—[laughs]
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: [crosstalk] We got both, so maybe we’ll keep me doing it. I didn’t know how it was gonna roll. I thought I might go too high—and I might—you know. Anyway, I died. I died. [Jenny laughs] I laughed forever, because the pitch that she reached on just the word "void" is…[laughter] delightful.
Hrishi: That’s great.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Followed by, "That’s right! Die, you bastard!" Dawn! Is! Out! For! Blood!
Kristin: [simultaneously] [laughs] So fun for Michelle Trachtenberg.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: This is the shit—if I could act in one fucking thing, it would be, like, a scene like this. [laughter] Just shit going banana town, you know? Oh, how fun. Okay, so then…why don’t we just finish out this scene?
Jenny: Sure. A glowing Joyce appears.
Kristin: Yeah. And she’s like, "Mom?" And Joyce says, "Things are coming, Dawn. I love you and I love Buffy, but she won’t be there for you when it’s bad. Buffy won’t choose you. She’ll be against you."
Jenny: And then she disappears.
Hrishi: Worst hologram ever. [laughter]
Kristin: Yeah, pretty rough. Pretty rough.
Jenny: Yeah, I want a refund. [Hrishi laughs]
Kristin: I feel so awful for Dawn. I mean. She just…not that Buffy—not that I, like, envy Buffy’s experience in The Body and all that she went through. But it just feels like Dawn is constantly just getting, like, the tiniest little bits of things to, like, grieve with or process with. It’s just—she gets, like, just what’s left over, and this feels like more of that. Like, Joyce appears and it’s really fucking terrifying. And then she says one confusing and scary thing and then is gone—it’s just—it feels like a lot for poor little Dawnie.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Jenny: Yeah…this is not great. But also, Dawn, think! Your mother has passed on. But do you have any reason to think that your mother can see the future? From that vantage point?
Kristin: But this is, like—this is like Willow not being able to clock evil Cassie right away.
Jenny: [simultaneously] [groaning] I know, I just—
Kristin: It’s like, the trauma—like, at least I can believe that the trauma that Dawn carries and that Willow carries, like, would make them buy into this for a bit. So. Speaking of Willow, in the library. Oh, boy, in the library. [laughs] [Jenny exhales] You wanna take this one to its epic end as well?
Jenny: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Willow’s all, "But Giles says quitting cold turkey is dangerous." And Cassie’s like, "No, you must—just—no more magic." Willow’s like, "I’m not strong!" And then—[laughs] oh, Cassie. Cassie with the, "There is one thing you could do to stop it." [laughs] She just can’t be cool!
Kristin: Like, be cool, man. Be cool.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Cassie, if you could just be cool! [laughing] This coulda gone totally differently.
Kristin: Willow’s face instantly is like, uhh, [record scratching noise] full record scratch, on Willow’s face.
Jenny: [gasps] "Everybody will be safe and you’ll be together again. It’s not that bad, it’s just like going to sleep!"
Kristin: I will give Cassie or whoever the fuck Cassie is some points for being like, "Suicide went too far? You seemed so ripe, it could have been great. Candlelight, the Indigo Girls—" I just love that whatever Cassie is—
Jenny: No.
Kristin: She knows that the way to make a lesbian reference is to throw the Indigo Girls in. [laughs]
Jenny: I just don’t know if Indigo Girls is, like, the music of profound sorrow and giving up.
Kristin: Yeah. It’s true.
Hrishi: [laughing] Depends on how you feel about them. [laughter]
Kristin: Oh, wow! [laughter] Ugh, god. But I do—so I love evil Cassie. I have to say that—is her name Azura Skye? Is that—
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: What this actress’s name is?
Jenny: Oh, yeah.
Kristin: I enjoy—she gets just a little moment, the tiniest little moment, of where Willow knows and she gets to just be her evil whoever-she-is self. [Jenny laughs] "You don’t know hurt. I’m done with the mortal coil, but believe me, I’m going for a big finish." Willow—has Willow said it before?
Jenny: Willow says, FBYID! [laughter]
Kristin: And Cassie is like, it’s actually FBYMD. [laughter] Not it. Me, motherfucker! And then her mouth turns inside out! And swallows her whole self into a black hole, it’s crazy!
Jenny: Just—
Hrishi: That was some wild…
Jenny: Just not—
Hrishi: Visual effects. [laughter]
Kristin: Wild!
Jenny: [laughing] It’s just not what you want.
Kristin: [laughing] Wild! It’s like her mouth was its own portal that sucked herself in it backwa—crazy.
Jenny: Yeah.
Hrishi: Yeah.
Kristin: Truly.
Jenny: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Kristin: Well. Two more threads to go. Where should we go next?
Jenny: Back to the cemetery! "How do you know Spike?" "He’s the guy that, uhh… [snaps repeatedly] what is the word for it?" [Kristin laughs]
Hrishi: Gave me his seed—
Jenny: [simultaneously] He made me like this.
Hrishi: [simultaneously] I believe is what Kristin—[laughter] [crosstalk]
Jenny: [simultaneously] Yeah, he penetrated me with his…
Hrishi: [laughing] Sire seed.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Sharp. Pointy. [laughs]
Kristin: Oh, no.
Hrishi: You introduced "sire seed" into the—[laughs]
Kristin: [simultaneously] We came in thinking we had Sexual Tension Awards set. And they have gone off the rails in this conversation. [laughter]
Jenny: [sighs] It’s not great. That just doesn’t—that doesn’t seem great. How could Spike be the guy that sired, uhh, Holdy Webs? I don’t know.
Kristin: Yeah. But then, there he is, siring Justine Junior.
Jenny: Biting the crap out of her. It’s not good.
Kristin: Spike, I think, is the vampire that has the best bloody teeth. Like, I like—
Jenny: Yeah, and he’s always, like, touching them sexily—
Kristin: Yeah!
Jenny: And, like, lustfully. [laughter]
Kristin: Yeah, it’s good! It’s good. James Marsters knows how to work a bloody tooth, if I do say so myself. [laughter]
Jenny: Ahh! And then, speaking of blood. Uhh. The final button. Over at the high school, oh no.
Kristin: Yeah.
Hrishi: Mmm.
Jenny: Andrew stabs Jonathan and Jonathan’s computer-generated blood covers that Hot Topic evil seal in no time at all.
Kristin: Jonathan.
Jenny: That’s a blood-covered seal. RIP Jonathan.
Kristin: RIP Jonathan. Ugh.
Jenny: And RIP Holden Webster, who is now just…
Kristin: Dust.
Jenny: But a pile of dust.
Kristin: Yeah, yeah. I’m glad he’s gone, I’m not glad Jonathan’s gone. And here we are.
Hrishi: And unfortunately, Danny Strong was never heard from again. [laughter]
Kristin: Yeah. Wonder whatever happened to that guy.
Jenny: Yeah. Ugh, I hope he’s okay. [laughter]
Kristin: If they hadn’t killed him off in Season 7, he could have had an epic career in front of him, but. [laughter]
Jenny: Oh my word!
Kristin: Well. Jenny? Hrishi?
Jenny: Yes.
Kristin: Are we ready to get sexy, or…
Hrishi: [laughs] Get?
Jenny: [simultaneously] Get?
Hrishi: Ahh!
Jenny: Remain? Yes.
Kristin: Mmm.
Hrishi: Jinx, Jenny. [laughter] [SEXUAL TENSION AWARD jingle plays] Sexual tension award!
Jenny: Well! Welcome back to another installation of our sweatiest segment, the Sexual Tension Awards. Today, we have some slots for your noms and noms for your slots. Some of them guest-generated by Hrishi himself.
Kristin: Mmhmm. [Hrishi laughs]
Jenny: I can’t even believe it. So much has happened. We came into this episode thinking we had our four noms locked, but almost everything has shifted. Everything but one has shifted. And here…is what you have to choose from on this most blessed day. In slot number one, they were strangers until they weren’t! It’s Holden Webster and Spike. In slot number two, sometimes the magnetism between a collection of bones and the flat of a thumb [Kristin laughs] with the lubricant of red in between them, easing their movements against one another, cannot be contained. It is Spike and his bloody, bloody, bloody teeth. [Hrishi laughs]
Kristin: Hot.
Jenny: In slot number three, sometimes less is more. And sometimes, absolutely nothing is even more than less. [laughter] It’s Cass—[laughs] it’s Cassie’s mouth and negative space! Cassie’s mouth just turns her entire self into nothing at all. And that’s hot to me. [laughter] And in slot number four.
Hrishi: [laughing] That’s my preferred vote.
Jenny: It’s a shame.
Kristin: [laughing] Yeah! It’s everybody’s kink, here on this podcast. [laughter]
Hrishi: Excuse me, are you into self-abnegation? [laughter]
Jenny: But now, with a cluster of truly incredible and, like, never before seen pairings that we just ran down, it’s a shame to waste those noms on this episode, when truly, I know in my heart of hearts, that only the fourth slot…and the noms held within can take the gold medal, this episode. You’ve heard the rumors! We’ve heard the rumors! [Hrishi laughs] Things happen, things were said and done and touched. And held. And stroked and kissed and embraced [laughter] that can never be—[laughing]
Kristin: The shepherd’s crook is, like, creeping into frame. [laughter]
Jenny: That can never be said—unseen, unsaid, untouched, unstroked or unheld.
Kristin: [laughing] Oh my fucking god.
Jenny: [laughing] It’s all those rumors about Buffy and Faith that ran like wildfire through Sunnydale High School in Season 3. Those! Are your noms and their respective slots. Please make your voice heard in our beautiful, sexy democracy. Cast your vote in our Twitter poll, which will be up for one week, starting today. Find it @BufferingCast. Thank you very much. [SEXUAL TENSION AWARD jingle plays] Sexual tension award!
Kristin: That…is an episode. Hrishi. How are you feeling?
Hrishi: I’m feeling good.
Kristin: Are there any—are there any thoughts that we didn’t, you know, get from you that you wanna speak on? Do you have any—
Hrishi: No. No, no, no. I got my Eddie Murphy shoutout in, that’s really what I…
Kristin: Great, great, great. [laughter]
Hrishi: That’s my number one—
Kristin: You got some data in there. [Hrishi laughs] You got some Eddie Murphy in there.
Jenny: Oh, yes!
Kristin: [sighs] It is such a joy to have had you here with us.
Hrishi: I stole that skip intro porn name from Josh Malina. [laughter]
Jenny: Thank you for your honesty.
Hrishi: If you wanna just drop that—drop that in—
Kristin: [simultaneously] I like that you waited till the very end to admit—yeah.
Hrishi: [simultaneously] Yeah, exactly, when we’re not recording. [laughter]
Kristin: Hrishi, I know that you and Jenny are going to, you know, be on tour. But is there anything else you wanna tell our gentle listeners about, that they should know?
Hrishi: My website is hrishikesh.co. I’m on Twitter and Instagram, @HrishiHirway. And I have a newsletter that you can find at hrishikesh.bulletin.com.
Jenny: Nice.
Kristin: And all of that, of course, will be in the show notes for you, if you wanna scoop it up.
Hrishi: Come see Jenny and myself on tour. We’re gonna be on the east coast in March and on the west coast in May. The day that we start tour is gonna be a day that my EP comes out, and I’m so excited. I’m scared out of my mind, because I haven’t been on tour in so long. But much like our Venn diagrams of knowledge, [laughing] Jenny will be gently holding me the whole time. [laughter] Keeping me safe. I hope.
Kristin: Well, lucky for everybody—I mean, you know, you haven’t been on tour in a long time. But also, most of us haven’t really seen anybody on tour in a long time.
Hrishi: [laughs] Right.
Kristin: We’re all holding each other. You know?
Hrishi: Yes.
Jenny: Yeah.
Hrishi: Yeah. But we’re gonna be playing a set—a joint set, Jenny and myself, on stage the whole time. It’s not like one of us is opening for the other. We’re playing together. We’re playing songs that we—a lot of songs that we wrote together. We’re playing some Buffering songs, actually. [Kristin gasps]
Jenny: Mmhmm!
Kristin: What!
Hrishi: And—
Jenny: Seems like every time we get together to talk about the set list, yet another Buffering song gets added to the set list. [laughter]
Hrishi: I will not apologize. I will not apologize—[laughs]
Kristin: [simultaneously] I don’t know, nobody’s contacted my booking manager about, uh, Glockenspiel, so…
Jenny: [laughing] Okay.
Kristin: I don’t know how you could possibly…
Jenny: Mmhmm!
Kristin: Uh-huh. [laughs]
Hrishi: But there’s also gonna be probably a lot of talking in between the songs. You know, most shows, there’s a little bit of talking in between a lot of songs. Here, we’re gonna have a lot of talking in between all the songs. [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah, yeah.
Hrishi: Because we’re gonna tell stories about what the songs meant and how they were inspired. Sort of a little bit of Song Exploder and a little bit of Buffering, kind of meeting and having—having a baby on stage.
Kristin: I love that!
Jenny: Oh yeah, and we’re gonna be having a baby on stage. [laughter] Is that weird?
Kristin: Wow. Wow.
Jenny: Things are moving along.
Kristin: [simultaneously] You can really up the ticket prices, I think, for that shit. [laughter]
Jenny: Yeah. [laughter]
Kristin: Amazing. Alright, Jenny, let’s—let’s tell the people who we are.
Jenny: Oh yeah! Well, I’m Jenny Owen Youngs. And when I’m not making this podcast with Kristin, I’m, like, writing and recording and performing songs, as Hrishi just mentioned. Like, I’ll be performing some of them [high-pitched] with him while we’re going on tour, [Kristin laughs] [normal voice] this spring. That’ll be very fun. You can find out all about me and tour and what I get up to at jennyowenyoungs.com. And you can give me a shout on socials @JennyOwenYoungs.
Kristin: And I’m Kristin Russo. When I’m not here, basking in the glow of Jenny and Hrishi on a podcast, I am working with LGBTQ communities.
