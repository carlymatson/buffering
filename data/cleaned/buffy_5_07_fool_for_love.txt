Jenny: Oh hey! Hey.
Kristin: Hi.
Jenny: Hello!
Kristin: How's it going?
Jenny: Well, it's so great!
Kristin: Wanna go to San Francisco?
Jenny: I do. This episode that you're about to listen to… is gonna come to you live from the Brava Theater in beautiful San Francisco, where we had a very nice time with some very nice people and some particularly spectacular lighting design.
Kristin: [laughs] We were joined by Kate Leth. We were joined by Joanna Robinson. It was truly an awesome show. We hope you enjoy it. Before we get there, we have a few things we want to talk to you about. One, I was so excited on the stage of the Brava Theater that I misspoke a bit. I wanna just apologize, I conflated Angel having his soul—he has a soul in China, he does not have his soul in London. You know that, I knew that. But just so when you get there, you're not like, "uh, no" and I get 400 emails. I know, I know, I know.
Jenny: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.
Kristin: [laughs] Also, you may be wondering who won the Sexual Tension Award poll from Family where the crystal dildo gave us all a run for our money. You're gonna have to wait because we announce the winners inside the episode with Kate Leth, of course.
Jenny: Yeah. [suggestive noises] Also in this episode, wow, at the very end of this episode, wow. You're welcome in advance. A very special day. That features...the premiere, the debut of a voice for Spike. We are joined, musically, by the incredible Cory Branan, a wonderful dude with whom I have played many shows and enjoyed many a good musical hour. He is so great.
Kristin: Oh, and he sounds great. He's all like Spike meets Tom Waits.
Jenny: Uh-huh. That's…
Kristin: It's real nice. You're gonna like it.
Jenny: The idea. Yep, yep, yep.
Kristin: So welcome, Cory, to the family. [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah, and thanks for being here. And also check out all of his records, they are everywhere that you find records. He's so, so great.
Kristin: Yeah, and we'll put a link for finding more about Cory in the show notes.
Jenny: Oh, yes.
Kristin: Speaking of links, you'll also find a link to our store where we have lots of new merchandise. We have the new Just Keep Fighting tee, we have the gold foil Smash the Demon Lizard Patriarchy t-shirt, which we got to see in San Francisco and I'm obsessed with it. Sleepaway Witch Camp t-shirts, we've got Tis the Season crewnecks. In the UK store, we have a Tis the Season tee. There's a few ornaments left? There's not a lot, so if you want your ornament, you better snag it.
Jenny: Act now!
Kristin: 'Cause, yeah, there's only a few left 'cause everyone is obsessed with them, as are we. I have one hanging on my tree.
Jenny: The only thing scarier that I can think of than not getting a Smash the Demon Lizard Patriarchy ornament when I want one very badly is…
NOTES: [SPOOKY NEWS jingle plays] Spooky news!
Kristin: Alright, Jenny, to round out this year, 2019, I'm gonna give you a story—a spooky news story about a mysterious blob that was discovered in a Paris zoo. It is called "le blob" because Paris. [Jenny laughs] And there's a lot of things about this blob, but I know everybody wants to get to the live episode. So I'm gonna just tell you that it was discovered—it has 720 sexes. It has no brain. It's unclear if it's a fungus or an animal. It can learn things. It has no stomach or mouth but it can digest things. And get this—
Jenny: Uhh…
Kristin: If you teach it something, which the scientists who are, you know, investigating "le blob," they've discovered that if you teach—they teach one blob something, then it will sit next to another blob—
Jenny: Wait, there's more than one blob?
Kristin: Yeah. Yeah, there can be many blobs.
Jenny: Does the blob subdivide like a worm?
Kristin: Yes, the blob can subdivide.
Jenny: Ohh!
Kristin: Well, so, here's another crazy thing. If you cut it in half, it can heal itself in two minutes.
Jenny: [quietly] Oh no.
Kristin: Yeah, so look out for "le blob."
Jenny: Oh no.
Kristin: [laughs] Coming to a theater near you? No, it's—yeah, I don't know, it just seems really cool and maybe scary. But maybe it will be the thing that takes over the planet and maybe that'll be good, you know? Maybe we need a lot of multi-gendered blobs.
Jenny: Um.
Kristin: To bring in 2020.
Jenny: I'm scared.
Kristin: Okay. [laughs] Well, that's been your non-holiday-specific—oh, now I just pictured "le blob" with a little Santa hat on.
Jenny: Okay, that does take the edge off a little bit.
Kristin: There you go. That has been your Spooky News.
NOTES: [SPOOKY NEWS jingle plays] Spooky news!
Jenny: Hey, a quick update/reminder on Prom coming this April. Our live taping of I Was Made to Love You on April 17th is sold out, but there are still tickets available for prom on the 18th.

Jenny: Ha!
Kristin: As the original lyric perhaps went.
Jenny: Yes, of course.
Kristin: Next week is the last episode of the year for Angel On Top, Darla—

Jenny: Hello and welcome! [audience cheers] Hello and welcome to Buffering the Vampire Slayer, a podcast where we are watching and discussing every episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer— [audience laughs] [at a distance] excuse me. [Kristin and the crowd laugh] One at a time! [audience cheers]
Kristin: For the listener at home, Jenny a la Britney Spears circa 1999, flipped her chair around and sat back down on it. [audience cheers]
Jenny: I was thinking of doing it more in the style of a cool stepdad or substitute teacher, who just wants to be real with the kids. [audience cheers] Spoiler free! I am Jenny Owen Youngs. [applause] It cannot be denied!
Kristin: [laughs] And I am Kristin Russo. [applause] And today, today, San Francisco and surrounding Bay Area— [applause] we are here to discuss Fool For Love. [audience cheers] Stay tuned at the end of this podcast every other week for a song written by Jenny Owen Youngs and sometimes with help from Kristin Russo. Cool. So who wrote this? Who wrote this shit?
Jenny: Fool For Love was written by Doug Petrie, directed by Nick Mark!
Kristin: Who?
Jenny: Nick Mark! [laughter] And originally aired… on November 14th in the year 2000.
Kristin: Do you have, um…
Jenny: Just! A handful of days before— [laughs]
Kristin: Before what? Your 19th birthday?
Jenny: Before I turned the tender age of 19. [laughs and a few cheers]
Kristin: Jenny and I—this is like seeing a shooting star for you, because Jenny and I, on this very day, are the same exact age. [a few cheers] Yes.
Jenny: Yes, enjoy it while it lasts, ancient one.
Kristin: [laughs] We're both 29… [laughter]
Jenny: But we look… 27. [laughter]
Kristin: This is the one where we learn all about Spike and then he— [audience cheers] [Kristin sighs loudly] That's the IMDB description. [laughter] Actually, Jenny, if you'll just give me a short moment, I would like to start the—
Jenny: As if I have a choice. [laughter]
Kristin: I would like to start the episode off right. Because this is the one where…
NOTES: [SPIKE jingle plays] Spike! I love you Spike! So dreamy Spike! Your trench coat Spike! I love you Spike! Your black nails Spike! Peroxide
NOTES: [applause]
Jenny: Well!
Kristin: Is it alright if everyone—with everyone if I take off my red blazer? [laughter] I asked Jenny to carry me out on stage, but… her back is broken 'cause she's so old. [laughter]
Jenny: But not as old as the person who needed to be carried out on stage.
NOTES: [laughter]
Kristin: Wow. Off to the races!
Jenny: You got a real Miss Havisham vibe going on right now. [laughter] Without the jacket. Let's get a taste of that cake. [laughter and a few cheers] That is not what I meant. [laughter]
Kristin: Wow. I mean, this podcast is devolving. [laughter] We have—
Jenny: I blame Kate.
Kristin: I was just gonna say. Speaking of cake and sexual metaphors, we have Kate Leth here tonight. [audience cheers] And I'm not gonna ruin anything, but you're gonna hear a little bit of jingle-jangling when we bring out our other guest, whose name is Joanna fucking Robinson. [audience cheers] Ahem. Alright, we should probably start talking about the episode. So. Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer… so the previously on is Spike, I love you, Spike, basically. Right?
Jenny: That's about it, yes.
Kristin: Yeah. We get the things we need to know. Spike is a vampire, Spike has killed two Slayers. Spike's name is Spike because of a railroad spike, also William the Bloody. He's got a chip in his head. Buffy is having sex with him in his dreams. [laughter] I said that weird, but.
Jenny: I like that you said "Buffy's having sex with him, in his dreams" which is definitely what's happening. [laughter]
Kristin: Yes, we've established on this podcast, Spike is a bottom, Xander is a bottom. [audience cheers] Anya is a top. [audience cheers]
Jenny: Willow and Tara are two peasant bottoms. [laughter] Somehow gloriously mismatched together to great effect.
Kristin: And Riley takes off boots. [laughter]
Jenny: Does that make him, like, a switch? 'Cause he's doing something active, but it's sort of like, at ground level—I don't know. [laughter] There's something there.
Person in crowd: Service bottom!
Kristin: Service bottom!
Jenny: Service bottom.
Kristin: [chanting] Service bottom! [laughter] Service cardboard bottom. [laughter] Okay. So. We go to the graveyard, is what I wrote, but we've had this conversation a million times. I'm like a goldfish. It's a cemetery.
Jenny: Yes.
Kristin: Not a graveyard.
Jenny: Yes. [laughter]
Kristin: And… Edward Scissorhands—
Jenny: Slash!
Kristin: I know! I can—I have to do something that will make you mad at me for not saying the right thing, you know? That's my roll here.
Jenny: Okay—oh! [laughter]
Kristin: We get this super punked out vamp. Buffy's wearing a fucking scarf that I don't understand.
Jenny: So impractical for slaying! And so are the pigtails, so many handles. [laughter] So bad! You're giving your opponent way too many ins.
Kristin: It's true and it's also the skinniest little scarf. It's not providing any warmth, it's not—it's truly only there to get in the way.
Jenny: If you think this scarf is small, have you ever seen Veronica Mars? [laughter and cheers] Veronica Mars wears an eight-foot-long piece of dental floss that she wraps around—she's legit like the woman with the thing where you—[laughter]
Kristin: And she has two pennies!
Jenny: [laughing] And a bunch of matches to sell. And then when she takes her scarf off in front of her husband after they get married, her head falls off. It's a thing, just trust me. [laughter]
Kristin: That was actually good. That was a good transition.
Jenny: Uh-huh.
Kristin: Buffy does this—it's not—I don't believe it's a wrestling move. I think it's a gymnastic move, just a forward flip. She sort of circles through the air very beautifully. And the whole first scene is, you know, Buffy being Buffy. She's quipping, she's flipping, she's… sipping. She's not, but I wanted to keep going. And then, of course, this punk vamp turns her own stake on her and stakes her—
Jenny: [gasps]
Kristin: Gasp! And it is—I just remembered we didn't put screens on the microphones again. We're gonna be p'ing and t'ing all over the place. [laughter]
Jenny: I will not. Actually.
Kristin: Anyway, sorry, that was an aside. Back to what I was saying. [laughter] Which is that—okay, so Buffy takes her own stake to her stomach. And I think, and I'm curious as to if you agree with me, but I think that this is set up very much where you think it's a dream. Like, we cut to the credits, and I feel like if you watch this show, you're like, this didn't really happen. The blood is so red, this would never happen to Buffy.
Jenny: [sarcastically] Blood would never be this red! [laughter]
Kristin: I mean, it just seems really—it seems very dreamlike, I think, because we don't expect it to happen, just like Buffy of course did not expect it to happen. Cut to the credits.
Jenny: And then the credits are over. [laughter] And that's a lot of blood on that baby blue sweater!
Kristin: Oh, she's wearing baby blue? Kate's gonna be so excited. Yo—
Jenny: [sarcastically] Yeah, I'm sure that's what Kate's gonna be excited about in this episode. [laughter]
Kristin: Okay. Buffy pulls the fucking stake out of her stomach. Like—
Jenny: Okay. You're not—
Kristin: You don't do that!
Jenny: But—okay, but in her defense, you also don't leave it in. [laughter]
Kristin: I think you do! Do we have a doctor?
NOTES: [people in the crowd shout things]
Jenny: Eh-eh-eh, don't involve them! [laughter]
Kristin: No! No.
Jenny: They know too much.
Kristin: No, we have a doctor right here. Do you pull it out or do you leave it in?
Person in crowd: [inaudible] a nurse.
Kristin: A nurse.
Person in crowd: You leave it in—[inaudible]
Kristin: You leave it in—
Jenny: Okay, but what if you're still fighting a vampire and you need maximum mobility? Then what? [laughter] Pardon?
Person in crowd: Do what you gotta do. [laughter]
Jenny: Do what you gotta do! [audience cheers] But?
Person in crowd: Go to the hospital!
Jenny: But then go to the hospital. Or… well, we'll get into the or's, the other possibilities in a moment. But first! Things are not looking good for Buffy. I mean, they already weren't looking good for Buffy, and then she's—she's not doing so good.
Kristin: Yeah, there's a moment, before your boyfriend rolls up—[laughter]
Jenny: Mad about it! [sarcastically] "Oh, you saved her? The patriarchy!" [laughter] What a bad boyfriend.
NOTES: [THE PATRIARCHY jingle plays] The patriarchy! [thunder clap, evil laughter]
Jenny: No.
Kristin: I'm not—
Jenny: Literally no.
Kristin: Just simmer down. [laughter] I'm not mad about Riley helping, I'm mad about Riley being your boyfriend. [laughter]
Jenny: Did you say you're mad about Riley being my boyfriend?
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Oh, okay. [laughter] Yeah, well, I mean…
Kristin: Before the wonderful, beautiful, glistening Riley comes in to the save the day, I have something serious—
Jenny: Wouldn't you say he's, like, effulgent? [laughter and cheers] As we later learn, effulgent rhymes nicely with "has a bulge in it." [laughter] Which applies across the board!
Kristin: Yeah! It's true.
Jenny: The cardboard. [laughter]
Kristin: I'm gonna go.
Jenny: I'm helping, I'm helping!
Kristin: I'm gonna go, she's good. [laughter] Can I say something serious?
Jenny: Yes.
Kristin: I know, right? No, Kristin, you cannot. But I wanna just call attention to one thing before Riley strolls in with his bulges and effulges. [laughter] Which is that Buffy is up against the—what do you call that thing? [crowd responds] Mausoleum. [laughs] Thank you. She's up against the mausoleum and the vamp comes for her and there's this moment. And she really does not fight back, and I feel like it's an important moment, because in the rest of the episode, we learn about—we'll talk about it. But we learn about what piece of the Slayer is often involved in the death of the Slayer. Which is a death wish, and I think we see a glimmer, a glint, if you will, in Buffy's eyes.
Jenny: To a certain degree, can you blame her? I just like… flew here from LA today and I had a delay where I got on the plane and they were like, "there's a delay" and then we got off of the plane. And I was like… [sighs] "I don't know!"
NOTES: [laughter]
Kristin: Yeah. Truly.
Jenny: "This feels like a lot!" [laughter] And she's out there every night. And there is no delay on the SS Vampire, which is not how planes are named, traditionally.
NOTES: [laughter]
Kristin: I do not blame her at all for having a bit of a death wish. And to get serious for a second, I think this is a big thing to talk about, right? We, all of us Scoobies, right, we—one of our anthems that we have from our podcast is "just keep fighting." It's hard to just keep fighting. And Buffy has been at this now for many, many years. And at some point in the episode, the phrase "death is on your heels" is said, and that's what she lives with every day. So I don't think that it's bananas at all for any of these Slayers to have had a death wish, 'cause it gets real fucking hard. Right? [crowd starts laughing] Don't… [crowd laughs] Seriously? Seriously ?
Jenny: Well—there was a greater… I'm sorry. [laughter] There was a greater context where you were like, "death is on her heels." And it's like, well, I mean, death used to, like, be… all over the place… and now she just has Riley on her heels, pulling her boots off real slow. [laughter]
Kristin: I have a question. I'm gonna pose as many of my questions as I can before Kate and Joanna come out, so that they can ruminate on them. But there are many Slayers. And we learn about two, which we'll discuss. One who is in China. Another one, New York City. Buffy, Sunnydale, except for that one weird time when she was in Cleveland. So I just—we know that there is a Hellmouth in Sunnydale. But why was the Slayer in China in 1900 and why was the Slayer in New York City in '77?
Jenny: Doesn't it just seem like a bad structural plan to just have the one, like, wherever?
Kristin: Yeah. [crowd affirms]
NOTES: [THE PATRIARCHY jingle plays] The patriarchy! [thunder clap, evil laughter]
NOTES: [crowd laughs]
Kristin: It's too much power for me. [laughter] To have—to have all these jingles. Okay. So Riley is—Riley's been trained in combat bandaging. [laughter]
Jenny: Paging Dr. Riley… for medical patch-up. Second floor of the Summers' household. Please report, clothing optional. [laughter]
Kristin: I just feel like I could have done this bandaging job. It looks like he taped a piece of the bandage—
Jenny: Yeah, you could have pulled that boot off too, but you didn't! [laughter]
Kristin: I woulda pulled that boot off better. 
Jenny: [laughing] Okay!
Kristin: I just feel like he taped the little bit of bandage and then was like, "can you spin around for me? Could you just… " [laughter] Just looks a little loose! They have this exchange that's very important, because Riley is like, "so how many vamps were there? Was it this super crazy bad guy?" And she was like, "no, it was just one vampire." Which is scary. But not as scary as Dawn.
Jenny: [laughs] Oh! Dawn's doing so great!
Kristin: She is.
Jenny: She's warning them that Joyce is coming, she covers up.
NOTES: [pause]
Kristin: That's all you got? [laughter] No, she is, she is. She's warning them about Joyce, but like, was Joyce gonna barge in? 'Cause that seems weird. So she opens the door, right, and they have a very cute exchange. And I guess that they're having cuter exchanges now because Buffy has the temper on "this isn't just my little sister," you know? Right? I just panicked, you guys, I was like, "we got there, right?!" [laughter] We all know Dawn's The Key? [pants nervously] Oh god!
NOTES: [exhales]
Jenny: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're definitely seeing an extra layer to Buffy's side of their relationship.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Especially when she's like, "check out my wound." [laughter] And Dawn's like, "cool! I mean, gross."
Kristin: Right, and Dawn's like, "I will help you with the house stuff." And Riley is like, [starts laughing] "I will help you with the patrolling." [laughter]
Jenny: "But could you please, for my peace of mind, my handsome boyfriend who's so strong, I worry about it. Could you please take my very helpful friends?" [laughter] "They're great at patrol! They bring snacks… they dress inconspicuously."
NOTES: [laughter]
Kristin: Has Anya ever been on patrol?
Jenny: No!
Kristin: Anya is—she's like, wearing heels, I think. She's got—
Jenny: Buffy wears heels all the time to patrol!
Kristin: Well, Anya is—she's like hobbling the whole time, like, trying to keep her scarf over her shoulder. She's got a purse.
Jenny: Yes.
Kristin: It's good. Riley does a beautiful hand move. Choo… choo. [laughter] Willow is looking fantastic .
Jenny: What? What? It's like, you start at the top and you're like, surely this has to be the worst part. [laughter] This sort of crushed chenille bucket hat, but in a condom style? [laughter] Then you move down and you're like, oh no, it's spreading! [laughter] The sweater is way more infected than the hat. [laughter] And then somehow, she is wearing white pants with pink flowers twined all over them—
Kristin: Green, green! They're green.
Jenny: They look pink. Maybe… I'm infected too now. [laughter]
Kristin: So they have this exchange. My favorite part of the exchange is something that didn't actually happen. Like, Riley's pissed. They're chomping on chips. They're yelling at Riley—
Jenny: It's very loud chomping. His concerns are reasonable.
Kristin: They are, they are. And then Xander screams out. Riley's upset about it. And he—what he says—'cause I turned the closed captioning on. And what he says is, "See, now he's all mad and sarcastic." But what I heard three times before I turned the closed captions on was, "See, now he's all Madam Sarcastic." [laughter]
Jenny: And you were like, "who is she?" [laughter]
Kristin: Wow. Yes.
Jenny: But then…
Kristin: Yes.
Jenny: Do you know what else he says?
Kristin: I do. But you should tell us.
Jenny: Riley's—and this is relatable content, folks, so buckle up. "Riley's like a big jungle cat. How come I'm not like that? He's just so cool." And then I think—I turned the closed captioning on and it said "boy-oy-oy-oy-oing!" [laughter]
Kristin: Yeah, no, it did. I kept mine on and that is exactly—
Jenny: Cool, cool, cool. And then like… I don't wanna get ahead of exactly where this happens in the cemetery. But there's a thing where they're running all low in a line, and Xander's hand is very close to Riley's butt the whole time. And they're running… [footstep sound effects] just something you might wanna go back and enjoy.
Kristin: Whew! You think Xander has some boots at home? [laughter] Oh, what do you do when you're a service bottom and a bottom-bottom? [laughter]
Jenny: So anyway! [laughter] Buffy's pissed off that there aren't any, I don't know, live tweetings of the last time that a Slayer was killed.
Kristin: Yo. But like, okay, so… right, Buffy's like, "what happened?" And Giles is like, "there's no record." And there's this very sad— [Jenny squeaks] [pause] squeak moment for Jenny. [laughter] Where Giles is trying to say, "I think that probably this was too painful for them and that's why they didn't…"
Jenny: Dad!
Kristin: Should I play his jingle?
Jenny: Yeah! [audience cheers] [GILES jingle plays] Giles! Hot dad! When you were younger you were real bad But now you're older, you got glasses That help you watch over us! Thank you, Giles! [applause]
Kristin: And so Giles has a jingle, and if you've been paying attention to the podcast, you will notice that the Watcher's Council does not. [laughter] [audience cheers] Actually, I guess they do, yeah. It's the patriarchy jingle. But my point is that I think that Giles is a bit… rose-colored-glasses. Like, I think that he loves Buffy… "he has a father's love for the child." And I think that he thinks these records haven't been kept because he wouldn't be able to keep that record. But I actually think that if we think about the Council, and we think about the Slayers, they probably just don't give a fuck, right? It's like, "one's out, another one's in!" I don't think that—I think that—
Jenny: Well, the larger structure of the Council, which, you know, is employing a lot of people in tweed. [laughter] But I think on a Watcher by Watcher—like, the Watcher that actually has custody of the current living Slayer, I think that relationship is often not—
Kristin: Is personal?
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kristin: Alright.
Jenny: That's what I—well, we don't really have anything else to go off of. Although Faith and her Watcher were close—
Kristin: Do we have any Watchers in—
Jenny: Do you remember Faith? [audience cheers] And her Wa— [Jenny laughs] Yeah, okay. [laughter] I mean, when are we gonna get to use it again? [FAITH jingle plays] She's from Boston, keeps it spotting, doesn't need any frills Seems like she's the only one who's taking care of herself Don't call her loser, she's a bruiser with the power and skill But the demons deep inside her are the hardest to kill Faith! [applause]
Kristin: You know what's remarkable is that I re-made this jingle playlist for today, 'cause we have some new jingles and I wanted to make sure they were all here. And so I was like, no, we won't need that one, we won't need that one. And then I looked at "Faith" and I was like, you know, we just might. And I'm so glad I did! But yeah. I mean, right. Faith's Watcher… ugh, remember her? Well, no, I mean before—
Jenny: You mean… no, she wasn't really Faith's Watcher, though.
Kristin: I know, but remember her? [laughter]
Jenny: Yeah, she was like Hermione, you once famously said. [applause] Just like Hermione!
Kristin: Thank you, Jenny, thank you.
Jenny: Attributed to Kristin Russo. [laughter]
Kristin: Thank you so much. "Jenny Calendar is dead," attributed to Jenny Owen Youngs. [laughter] Okay! Alright, so cut to Spike's crypt. Blam!
Jenny: It's a good day for Spike. 'Cause he's getting slapped around by Buffy.
Kristin: Oh! [applause] And he's like, "do it harder, baby, it doesn't feel like it usually does." Truly! He's like, something's up.
Jenny: He does say that, mm.
Kristin: And then they go to The Bronze, which is nice, because I feel like we haven't hung out there—I mean, we had Tara's party there, but it was very brief, a montage, you know. This is a real hang. [laughter] Spike's drinking some shitty beer. And he's like, "hey, you're asking me these questions and you want quick answers, but this is not a quick answer kind of a thing."
Jenny: This is more a, the duration of a plate of spicy buffalo wings kind of conversation. [laughter]
Kristin: Precisely. And lo and behold, when Buffy calls for the spicy plate of buffalo wings, she hurts her side. And he's like, "I knew there was something up with you." And then he says… a quote. It's on the poster, designed by Kate Leth. What do we think of this poster, by the way? [applause] "What can I tell you, baby? I've always been bad." Cut to the least bad— [laughter] the least bad man we've ever met. William the poet. "What rhymes with gleaming?" [sighs] So he's just—
Jenny: His glasses are so small! [laughter] They're so small! Just make them bigger! [laughter] That's like…
Kristin: I like 'em.
Jenny: That's—they're—I'm holding up imaginary lenses to my eyes right now, listeners, and I can tell you that more of my field of vision is outside… [laughter] of those lenses than inside.
Person in crowd: They're reading glasses!
Jenny: Don't you dare…! [laughter] How dare you!
Kristin: [laughs] Oh. Alright.
Jenny: So this nerd is at a party writing some poetry by himself. [laughter] We've all been there.
Kristin: We have! I just really like William the Bloody. I do, I think he's sweet. I would date him. So he's writing bad—I guess it's bad poetry, whatever. I've heard worse.
Jenny: Honestly! They laughed at "effulgent," but I feel like, as we learn earlier, the laugh line is really "a bulge in it." [laughter] It doesn't feel—in terms of the bad poetry I have experienced over the course of my life, it does not feel like a stand-out piece.
Kristin: Yeah. Cecily is a fucking asshole! [crowd cheers] I'm sorry. But this person—
Jenny: There are just other ways, madam!
Kristin: Yes! This is—she's just out to be shitty. She's being shitty for shitty's sake. There are so many ways that you can let someone know that they are a great person but you are not that into them. You know? And this is not fucking one of them. Fuck you, Cecily. [crowd cheers] She says—we should probably say what she says. "You're nothing to me, William. You're beneath me." [audience boos] And then he cries. [audience "aww"s]
Jenny: Also, it's briefly mentioned at the party that there's been a rash of disappearances around town.
Kristin: Yes.
Jenny: I wonder who could be responsible?
Kristin: It's also mentioned at the party that William the Bloody existed—
Jenny: Oh yeah.
Kristin: Because he was so bloody bad at poetry, which is nice.
Jenny: His bloody awful poetry!
Kristin: And there's also that fucking asshat in the corner who's like, [British accent] "I'd rather have a railroad spike in my head than hear that poetry," and we're like, yeah, buddy! [laughter]
Jenny: Just wait, it's coming!
Kristin: That spike is headed your way. So Spike goes out into the London streets. And this is very cool if you are watching Angel or if you've watched Angel, this is a direct crossover. You see this scene from—are you so excited? So excited. Yes, it is, it is a crossover! 'Cause you see the scene from the other side, and I'm going to—I don't think this is a spoiler, 'cause it is in the timeline with the show. But we know, from watching both shows, that this Angel is Angel. Angel has his soul in this scene. He's gone back—if you're not an Angel watcher, this whole situation in London happens after Angel has gotten his soul and he's try—he loves Darla so much that he just wants to be with her. So he's trying to be a bad vampire, even though it's killing him. So that's important context. [Jenny squeals] Yeah, there's a lot—right? Oh, that was—I felt like I was on a talk show for a moment. [laughter] There was a murmur in the crowd, like [murmurs]. [laughter] But so we see this scene in the episode. Darla, which you'll hear Laura and Brittany and me talk about. [audience cheers] And then Spike—or William, I guess, goes back. He's crying and who appears?
Person in crowd: Jingle!
Kristin: I know, right? It's a very jingle-heavy episode, but how could we not? Are you ready? [audience cheers] [DRUSILLA jingle plays] Drusilla, you fill up my heart with dread And still I'm led right back to you
Jenny: [laughing] Okay! [audience cheers] Yes!
Kristin: Just in case you thought I was wearing this white lace turtleneck for some other bizarre reason. [laughter] Alright. So Drusilla is like, "I see you." And Drusilla is not a fucking liar, right? Because we see—
Jenny: She's many things, but not a liar.
Kristin: But not a liar. We've seen vampires tell humans what they wanna hear so they can bite them.
Jenny: And that does happen, but that's to the side for a minute.
Kristin: It does. This is very consensual. This is the most consensual siring I've seen. Is that true?
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: It is, right? [a few cheers] Yeah, props to fucking Dru. [audience cheers]
She's like, "hey. Here's what I know about you: you're fucking strong. You fucking are cool—" I didn't write the lines down, but this… [laughter] I did actually write
one: "You've got burning baby fish swimming round your head." [laughter]
Jenny: Okay. Okay. Uh-huh. She also says, "You walk in worlds the others can't begin to imagine" which is a little more accessible. [laughter]
Kristin: I don't know, I like the fish.
Jenny: She also grabs his junk, which is very…
Person in crowd: Accessible! [laughter]
Jenny: [laughing] Accessible! I mean, I can't…
Kristin: I'm sorry, what?
Jenny: She grabs his junk. It's like, off—it's out of the frame—
Kristin: She does?!
Jenny: Yeah, what show are you watching? [laughter]
Kristin: She grabs his… bulge-in-it? [a few cheers] I missed it, I missed the bulge-in-it grab.
Jenny: You can tell because of James Marsters' face. [laughter]
Kristin: He has that very specific cheekbone alignment.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: And she plucks the word "effulgent" sort of like, from him. Goddamn it, I love Drusilla. [audience cheers]
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah. Juliet Landeau, man. She rules. And then she says, "Do you want it?" And he's like, "Matter of fact, I do."
Jenny: But then he's like, "ow! Ow! Ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow!" [laughter]
Kristin: It's a little like Buffy the Vampire Slayer the movie when…
Jenny: [laughs] Paul Reubens?
Kristin: Paul Reubens dies, yeah. But it's funny, it's good, I like it. My next note is, "LOL Anya's waddle and purse." [laughter] So I guess we go back to the cemetery. The vamps are like, [blabbering in imitation]. [laughter] They're just like—
Jenny: Yeah, they have a real orc vibe going on. [laughter]
Kristin: [laughs] He's just still talking about how, "I killed her with her own weapon, blah blah blah." And Riley's like, "There's too many, we'll kill them in the morning."
Jenny: And this, now that I'm seeing it in my notes, is the scene where Xander is, and I quote, "basically running along, reaching for Riley's butt through the cemetery." [laughter]
Kristin: I know that somewhere in the audience, there's an Emily McLongstreet who will GIF that shit for us. [audience cheers] Thanks, Emily!
Jenny: Awooga! [laughter]
Kristin: And thanks for our whiskeys, too. Okay! Oh, great. My next heading—like, I head them where we go and it's "Bronze/pool table." [laughter] You know, I am queer. I know. [a few cheers]
Jenny: Oh! Finally! [laughter]
Kristin: I know you've been waiting a long time for me to tell you that. But I just fucking—a pool table will always do it for me. [audience cheers]
Jenny: Just the table?
Kristin: Uh, no. The table, the balls and the stick. [laughter]
Jenny: So that's actually—you've said some—you know what? Okay. [laughter]
Kristin: And even sometimes the little chalk? [laughter]
Jenny: [long pause] Help.
Kristin: Okay—
Jenny: If you're listening, if you can hear this, please help. [laughter] I'm being held against my will inside this podcast. [laughter]
Kristin: So Spike and Buffy are talking, Jenny.
Jenny: Yes?
Kristin: And Buffy's like, "eh, fucking—so you became a fucking vampire, whatever." And Spike is like, "no, man, fuck you. That's actually a really big deal to me." [laughter] You know, like, it's a profound experience. Then he—this is where I get even gayer. [laughter] He lights his fucking match on the pool table! [a few cheers] Queer women, please beware! [Jenny laughs] It's all I need, just light a match on a pool table, I'm yours!
Person in crowd: Noted!
Kristin : Thank you. Okay. What do you got, Jenny?
Jenny: I'll tell you what I got. "I was through playing by society's rules. I decided to make some of my own," inhale on cigarette to light it. "Getting killed made me feel alive for the first time."
Kristin: Wow. Ohh. [laughter]
Jenny: Okay! [laughter] I was just working with dynamics. I didn't know that was gonna hit. [laughter] Sometimes I'm loud! Sometimes I'm not.
Kristin: It's very—this is a very important episode, you know. I know that we're funny sometimes, but we have a lot of serious shit to talk about.
Jenny: So then—
Kristin: There she goes. Serious shit, you can tell just by her fucking stance.
Jenny: It's a flashback. And we're learning—
Kristin: Mm-hmm?
Jenny: We're learning about different artistic approaches. Angel is like, "mmm, delicious finesse."
Kristin: [inhales] Oh, I just put my whole mouth on the microphone. [laughter]
Jenny: Spike is like, "I'll put my whole mic—" [stops]
Kristin: [laughing] Aww!
Jenny: Damnit! [laughter]
Kristin: But yeah! Spike's approach is, "I will put my whole mouth on the microphone."
Jenny: Yes, thank you.
Kristin: Right, and they have different approaches, but also, remember, there's a lot going on for Angel. You know? There's a lot going on for him. [laughs] So Darla and Drusilla—so they're in hiding because Spike has been dramatic. I mean, pot calling the kettle, Angel. [laughter] The most dramatic of all vampires.
Jenny: Well! He's got 80 years on Spike. He's matured.
Kristin: He's got a soul on Spike, but yeah.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Alright. But the ladies. Drusilla and fucking Darla—
Jenny: Darla is like "hot, hot, hot, they're gonna fight, hell yeah!" [laughter] Her bodice is… tightened, I don't know! [laughter] What do women wear 100 years ago and how does it move?
Kristin: A corset and it doesn't. [laughter]
Jenny: Is a bodice a garm… I should ask Kate, but is a bodice a garment or is it a section of a garment? It's like, the boob area. [audience shouts out various answers]
Kristin: The crowd went wild.
Jenny: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! [laughter] Again, you know too much. Please hold.
Kristin: So were you gonna wait for Kate for the answer?
Jenny: Yeah, or I'll just do my own bodice research on my own time. [audience cheers]
Kristin: Both!
Jenny: Kate says, unsurprisingly, it's both. [laughter] Kate "It's Both" Leth, everybody. [audience cheers]
Kristin: First of all, Darla does—that's the sentiment. But Darla looks at Drusilla and she says, [singsong] "I think our boys are going to fight!" And it's good. And then Drusilla's like, "The king of cups wants his picnic but it's not his birthday yet!" [laughter] And then Darla's like, "Yeah…" [laughter] Darla's like, whatever you—
Jenny: "I'll work with it."
Kristin: I want a spin-off that's Darla and Drusilla from 1880 to 1900. [audience cheers]
Jenny: [laughs] Speaking of spin-offs we'd watch, it's time for a naughty little bottom to provoke a great big bear. [laughter] What, it's their— [inaudible]
Kristin: I'm sorry, you just looked right into my eyes when you said it, and it was too much for me to handle. [laughter] I was like, [gasps]. [laughter] Sorry, go ahead, a naughty little bottom does what? [laughter]
Jenny: [laughing] Spike, a naughty little bottom… [laughter] has to provoke, fucking, great big broad-shouldered daddy. [laughter]
Kristin: Yeah!
Jenny: See, I knew you would be on board.
Kristin: I was! I was on board for the whole thing except for the eye contact. [laughter]
Jenny: Honestly, I regret it.
Kristin: Yeah, they get up in each other's vampire sweat. In this scene. And then Spike learns that there is a thing called a Slayer. Incredible, that it took him 20 fucking years to learn that. Don't you just get that in your handbook?
Jenny: [laughs] It does seem a little weird that it hasn't come up yet, but maybe they've just been not on the same continent as the one and only Slayer.
Kristin: That's true. Okay, solid point.
Jenny: For a while. Um—
Kristin: Yes.
Jenny: Also, I feel like it's worth noting that Angel almost fucking stakes Spike?
Kristin: Yeah, well, makes sense, all things considered.
Jenny: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Which is why I bring it up, that's all.
Kristin: And then Spike is like, "yeah, Angel, stake me." [laughter]
Jenny: [laughing] He really is.
Kristin: So… we learn that Spike is now—he says, "I never hid, I sought her out." As soon as he learns there's a fucking Slayer—which this is kind of how I feel about—I mean, not Slayers.
Jenny: Uh-huh?
Kristin: But Spike likes a challenge, you know?
Jenny: [laughing] Okay.
Kristin: He's like, what could make me prove that I am a natural talent? Killing a Slayer.
Jenny: Help.
Kristin: What? I'm just saying, like, do you not have that feeling of—
Jenny: Yes, you and Spike are natural talents. [laughter]
Kristin: We are, but that is not the breaking piece of news. [laughter] "Lesson the first." I have a lot of things I like about this episode. One of my favorite things is the fact that he says "lesson the first" and "lesson the second." He really stuck it through, you know? He kept that—
Jenny: Ugh. Drama.
Kristin: And I love it. It's good.
Jenny: The drama.
Kristin: And he says something very important. "A Slayer must always reach for her weapon, but I've already got mine." And then he's like [snarls]. [laughter]
Jenny: [sarcastically] Wow, that is exactly what he's like—
Kristin: Natural talent.
Jenny: In the middle of The Bronze during a very busy time!
Kristin: Yeah. But the patrons there are not as surprised by him being a vampire as they are about the violence at the pool table, you know? [laughter]
Jenny: True…
Kristin: They're like, "yeah, yeah, vamps, but like, don't push her wound, man."
Jenny: [laughing] And both of them scream.
Kristin: [laughs] Okay. So. Now we get to lesson the first, which is China, 1900, the Boxer Rebellion. This Slayer has a fucking sword and I'm into it. [audience cheers] She's also got—
Jenny: Yeah, she's cool as hell.
Kristin: She's real fucking—I will also take a spin-off about this Slayer. That long braid, she's got—
Jenny: I'm starting to suspect that "spin-off" is a euphemism for you. [laughter and cheers]
Kristin: You caught me. And we see—I'm trying so hard to be serious for you all. But really, I just want to laugh and talk about sex. [a few cheers] So she—they're fighting and it's a fucking great fight. Props to the choreographer, the stunt person for this—all of the fight scenes in this episode are incredible. And she reaches for her stake after her sword gets stuck in a stone? I don't know, that's a whole thing. And this explosion goes off, so she drops the stake. Which is exactly what he's saying, right, like, he doesn't have—that is not an error that Spike can face. And then he kills her. And there's this moment, and that's why I brought up the moment at the mausoleum. [laughing] Title of my forthcoming memoir. [laughter] [Jenny guffaws; crowd laughs again]
Jenny: The Moment in the Mausoleum. [laughter]
Kristin: Where she just has this look, right? It's like, she wants to fight, but she's also fucking tired. And yeah. And he kills her. And before he kills her, she's like, "can you just tell my mom that I'm sorry?" And Spike is like, "Sorry, I don't speak Chinese." Fucking, yeah. We have moved from William the Bloody to Spike the asshole. And he drinks her blood, some of it. And then in comes fucking [sings] "Drusilla…" So what is that important thing, Jenny? What is the important thing that happens before we go—
Jenny: Um… oh my god, Drusilla comes in and she's like, "Look at the wonderful mess you've made" or whatever she says. And there's a lot of licking of blood off of fingers and rubbing of blood into gums and—
Kristin: No. No…
Jenny: Then they make out and then they, I think, fuck against a column. [laughter] Did I forget something?
Kristin: No, no, no. The fucking against a column, you started to get on track. But there wasn't a lot of licking of blood off of a lot of fingers, which is very—it's very specifically not that. It is the sucking of blood off of one f inger. And I think that it might be the most sexual thing that we have ever seen in this series to date. Apart from the boot! [laughter] But this is like—I was like, oh god, should I look away? [laughter] It seems like you guys are having a private moment. It's a lot.
Jenny: Yes, the blood of the Slayer is a powerful aphrodisiac, 1080p HD.
Kristin: [laughs] My actual note is "doing it/aphrodisiac/finger suck," in case you were wondering. Okay, so then they go outside, Jenny.
Jenny: Then they go outside and Dru's like, [singsong] "guess what my boyfriend did!" And then she's like—Angel's trying—you think that Angel's trying to look unimpressed, but he's actually bummed. And Dru's like, "It smells like fear." And Angel's like, "yeah! It smells like that all over here! All of these other people, not me! Definitely not me, I'm not afraid!"
Kristin: Well, and also, in "Darla," you know that there's a missionary family that he has seen and left in the alleyway. So there's also that fear that he's trying to protect them.
Jenny: Mm!
Kristin: Yeah, there's a lot going on for… [ANGEL jingle plays] Detective Angel… [applause]
Jenny: Wow.
Kristin: Great.
Jenny: I have to get something. For this. [audience cheers, laughs]
Kristin: If Jenny brought a fucking—I wanna just guess what it is, but I don't wanna blow up her spot if I'm right. So we'll just wait. How's everybody doing? [audience cheers] Great. Okay, great.
Jenny: Okay, so do you know what Kristin Russo thinks?
Kristin: What do I think?
Jenny: Kristin Russo thinks that when Spike jumps off of a one-foot-tall stack of flour sacks, he looks so cool !
Kristin: He does!
Jenny: Now I'm at least as cool as Spike, and this is twice as tall! [audience cheers] Do you believe in me?
Kristin: I believe in you, I wish you had a—you wanna put on my jacket? [audience affirms]
Jenny: Okay, okay, okay, for the sake of the experiment. [at a distance] I am a scientist. I can't do slow-mo unfortunately—well, I'll try my best.
Kristin: Be careful, Jenny. Jenny, for the listeners at home, is about to jump over a black box from the black box theater of this stage, as though it is the barrel. Don't worry, you'll be able to see it, because everyone in the audience is holding up their phones to video. [thud; audience cheers]
Jenny: What an idiot! [laughter and applause] I know—I have a vested interest in looking cool right now, and that did not look cool! You know it, I know it, Spike knows it.
Kristin: I think he looks cool. You got it in slow-mo? Thank you! Thank you! [audience cheers] Please send that to us at bufferingthevampireslayer@gmail.com. Thank you so much. [person in audience says something inaudible] I mean, it looks cool in the show, too. She's wrong. She's wrong about Riley, she's wrong about the barrel jump. But she looks great in suspenders, you gotta give her that. [audience cheers] [Ad music starts]

Kristin: Okay! So right after Spike jumps off the barrel—listen, I've had moments—a lot of moments in my life when I've tried to look cool on camera. So I understand—
Jenny: You're always jumping off boxes in slow-mo.
Kristin: I mean, even walking and looking cool is very difficult for me. So I just have a lot of respect for James Marsters 'cause he just, like jumps off the barrel and wa—his cheekbones are glinting in the moonlight. [laughter] I don't know, I think he looks cool. Discuss and debate amongst yourselves.
Jenny: He looks cooler than most people would look doing that. But that doesn't make it cool. [laughter]
Kristin: A debate for the ages.
Jenny: And I love him! And you know this.
Kristin: Alright, so, we cut back to The Bronze—
Jenny: Yo. You think it's wild for Buffy to hear stories about her ex in the Boxer Rebellion?
Kristin: Probably.
Jenny: She's like, "yeah, cool, tell me another—"
Kristin: She's like, "ugh, I unfollowed him on ancient Instagram. [laughter] Now he's all up in my mentions!"
Jenny: [laughs] Did you just say "ancient Instagram"? [laughs] Great.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Whew. [audience laughs] That's what I'm saying.
Kristin: I was trying to think of a name for it, but I just got stuck in Stonehenge-agram and it— [laughter] it didn't—it didn't fit. In-Stonehenge-agram… In… what do you got for us?
Jenny: Like, Monolith-agram? That's prob—that's actually—okay. I'll work on it.
Kristin: So we go back to The Bronze. And Spike is like, "That was the best night of my life." Which is really saying something for a vampire of his age. And Buffy is disgusted. She's like—this is like—we might as well—we could take Spike out and put Faith in, for this exchange. It's the same exchange that they have all the time. She's like, "You sicko, you got off on it." And he's like, "and you're telling me that you don't?"
Jenny: Buffy!
Kristin: Faith is in the corner, smoking a cigarette, like, "I fucking told you, B." [audience cheers and laughs] We all get off on it.
Jenny: Don't you remember that infamous set of unaccounted-for hours?
Kristin: [laughs] Oh, boy.
Jenny: Don't you remember— [laughter] don't you remember Buffy acknowledging the core truth of the post-slay hungry/horny factor?
Kristin: I do.
Jenny: Tacitly?
Kristin: I do.
Jenny: Don't you remember all those missing hours?
Kristin: I do. I remember them from the show, and I also remember them from you telling us—
Jenny: And we don't need to re-tread all of that right now, but… I'm just—I'm on your side.
Kristin: Thank you.
Jenny: That's all.
Kristin: I didn't know if I was on trial or being lifted up. [laughter] Um, yeah.
Jenny: I have your back on this matter.
Kristin: You know who else is probably into it? It's Kate Leth. [audience cheers] [applause]
Kristin: [at a distance] I'm gonna play your jingle.
Kate: [at a distance] Yeah? Alright, alright, okay. [Fashion Watch intro theme plays] It's time for our friend Kate To give you the Buffy fashion update! [applause]
Kate: Hi.
Kristin: Oh! Hi Kate.
Kate: Oh hi, it's me.
Kristin: How's it going?
Kate: This is so strange, you can't really… see people.
Kristin: You can, you just have to ask Kathy.
Kate: Okay, cool.
Kristin: Kathy, can we see the people? There they are!
Kate: Oh! Oh, hi! [audience cheers] [Kristin laughs] You go up so much higher than I expected! [laughs] Hello!
Kristin: Okay, Kathy, make the people go away. [laughter]
Kate: [laughing] Bye! I'll miss you!
Jenny: Thank you, Kathy!
Kate: Ugh, hi!
Kristin: Hi, Kate!
Kate: I'm just back there being like, [inhales sharply] I have so—you've talked—so many outfits, oh my god—
Kristin: I know, what do you have to say?
Kate: Ugh! So much. I have all these screenshots on my phone that I can't really share with you, but I will when you post it.
Kristin: Okay, okay.
Kate: Because this—sometimes, sometimes, I'm grasping at straws. I will not lie. There are certain ones—sometimes there's only two Xanders in an episode. [laughter] And so you really go on a tangent about buying clothing. [laughter] 'Cause you gotta keep the people entertained, but this one! My god. Start to finish, solid ensembles. Yes, that scarf. What is she doing?
Kristin: I mean—
Kate: I don't know! Only to be outdone by then Anya's scarf, which is somehow a Dr. Who longer than Buffy's. [laughter] It's incredible. There's—look, I can't—oh, I left my phone back stage. But I'll show—Willow's hat?
Jenny: No!
Kristin: Whew!
Jenny: We must never.
Kate: Is it felt? Is it… it's not crocheted, other—many… okay, look, I'm getting a little—
Kristin: Yeah, it's like what you do with wool when you make those little wool animals.
Kate: Yes. Yes!
Kristin: But instead it's a hat.
Kate: My mom does those. Anyway, she could have made this hat for Willow. [laughter]
Kristin: My mom should talk to your mom. My mom loves buying those wool things. So.
Kate: Oh, yeah. My mom loves to make them.
Kristin: We'll talk after.
Kate: She's very crafty. She's currently making us a giant sewn octopus with armature arms in it, just because. She found the pattern and I was like, "If you give us that, you don't have to get me anything else for the wedding. That's all I want, is a giant octopus." [laughter]
Kristin: Will it be at the wedding?
Kate: Absolutely!
Kristin: Fantastic.
Kate: [laughs] It's giving me away!
Kristin: Kate's getting married! [applause and cheers]
Kate: They're backstage being very supportive right now, but—
Kristin: Hi, Cohen!
Kate: Hi, Cohen! [audience cheers] [Kate laughs] Yes, we drove here from LA today so it's been an adventure. But yeah! Alright, so what do you guys wanna touch on in this specific— [crosstalk]
Kristin: I mean—oh! Oh, oh! What a—
Jenny: Well, I mean, Kristin—with Kristin, the fucking list never ends, what she wants to touch on.
Kristin: What a great way—
Kate: There's a lot of things in this episode I would like to touch on.
Jenny: [laughs] Yeah!
Kristin: Kate, that's actually a really great transition to the first—
Kate: Thank you so much.
Kristin: Yeah—the first thing that I would like to announce. Normally, we do the Sexual Tension Award winners in the intro, but due to incredible timing, we have the results from Family. And what I would like to share with you is—
Kate: I was there.
Kristin: You were—yeah.
Kate: Yeah.
Kristin: You were really, truly there. [Kate laughs] In so many ways. 7% of our voters voted for Farmer Finn and City Slayer. They did not do great.
Kate: I feel like we could have taken it farther and given the time, I feel like we should. Just explore that on a fiction stage—
Kristin: A spin-off?
Kate: Yeah. Yeah. Anyway. [laughter]
Jenny: Uh-huh? [Kate laughs] You spin until it's off. [audience laughs and cheers] It's your thing, don't look at me like that!
Kristin: Wow. 9% of our voters went for Wrestling Riley and Xander.
Kate: You're my people. [laughter]
Kristin: 37% went for Spike and Fantasy Buffy, leaving an entire 47% for the crystal dildo and all of us! [audience cheers]
Jenny: Hurray!
Kate: You know, our—we're staying near somewhere that's right across the street from a sex toy store and I—
Kristin: Truly?
Kate: Really—yeah, yeah. And I almost was like, I wonder… [laughs] I wonder if they have one that I could just bring. But they're very expensive.
Kristin: I did look up crystal massagers. I considered it as a gift.
Kate: They're a lot.
Kristin: But then I just didn't know if it was appropriate. To just carry dildos through TSA.
Kate: Yeah, no, that's probably fine to be limited to the theater of the mind. [laughter]
Kristin: Yeah. You know, fantasy, reality, reality, fantasy. Okay. So anyway, Kate. I mean, what we want to know is tell us your feelings on this—you drew this on an iPad—
Kate: I did!
Kristin: On an iPad! [audience cheers]
Kate: I went to visit my mom, shout out to my mom. She's great, she doesn't listen to this podcast, but shout out to her anyway. She's busy. She doesn't want to hear me talk about dildos, she's had enough of that. [laughter] But yeah, I was going to see her and I got this sort of frantic message, as I was boarding my plane. It's about a 12-hour journey to get from LA to Nova Scotia. And Kristin's like, "hey, uh, so if you have any time and can do this and we have two days." And I was like, [laughs] of course though! Of course. Of course I can do that. Ugh! So in between watching The Lion King on the screen of the person sitting in front of me on the airplane—
Jenny: Oh yeah.
Kristin: Uh-huh. As you do.
Kate: I drew most of this poster in a program that had come out the day before. [laughs] Thanks, Adobe Fresco, you really saved me on this one. [laughter]
Jenny: Fresco?
Kate: Yeah, you can save in vectors, it's great. So yes, that was born. My mom also helped me and told me at one point that I had spent too long on Spike's face. [laughter] She was like, "you need to move on" and I was like, well, it's been 19 years and it hasn't happened yet. [laughter and applause] I love him, I love him so much.
Kristin: I mean, I know. And that's—you know, when you're on episodes, we're often linear. This is not an episode I feel we need to be linear about.
Kate: No.
Kristin: What I feel is that you need to tell us what this episode means to you. Some of your—you know, whatever. Some of your favorite moments, what you think of cheekbones. Hey, what do you think of the barrel jump?
Kate: I… it's endeared to me like a child doing a piano recital—
Kristin: Jenny, shut up. [laughter]
Jenny: Yeah! [laughs] Yeah, that's right.
Kristin: Her stupid face! [laughter]
Kate: It's like, aww. [baby voice] You're so bad! [laughter]
Jenny: Aw, who's a bad boy?
Kate: Look at you! You just killing people, drinking their blood. [Jenny laughs]
Kristin: I figured out that to get Jenny's cheekbones to James Marsters' levels, you just need to tell me I'm wrong in front of her.
Kate: Yeah, you just… [laughter]
Jenny: Is Drusilla wearing a tiny little top hat? Or did I just— [laughter] put that in after the fact in my mind?
Kate: That's where she keeps all that's left of her sanity.
Jenny: Okay. [laughter]
Kate: It's real cute. Now, Darla's got lots of it. She's got seven hats on top of each other. Darla's outfit is incredible.
Kristin: Do you think it's one of her doll's hats?!
Kate: Oh, yes. Yes!
Kristin: Yeah!
Kate: Absolutely. She's amazing. And yes, obviously the—
Kristin: Blood of the Slayer.
Kate: [whispering] Blood of the Slayer. [normal volume] Yes, you know, we're not quite to that point yet. I don't know if you wanna go in the chronology, but when we get to the other Slayer—
Kristin: Oh, no. We're off the rails.
Kate: And they do the jacket reveal! [audience cheers] I lost it the first time I saw that!
Kristin: Yeah!
Kate: This came out in 2000, so I was 12? Had just turned 12. But yes, no, that was like, oh my god oh my god oh my god, that's where the jacket came from! And it was very exciting.
Kristin: It's an incredible…
Kate: It's so good.
Kristin: So you sit in writer's rooms a lot.
Kate: I do.
Kristin: And so I wanna know if you think—because it's a beautiful reveal. And there's a lot of this show that they very much knew in advance. Do you think that they knew that in advance, or do you think they were like "you know what'd be fucking cool?"
Kate: Yes. No, I can absolutely, 100% guarantee what happens is they were talking about, oh, what would she wear, you know, we're gonna really play up his Kid Vicious thing and do that whole thing. And they were like, oh, she could do this. And then someone was like, oh my god. [laughter] What if she had the leather jacket?
Kristin: Ugh!
Kate: And then everyone in the room was like, put it on the board! Put it on the board! [laughter] It's going in the episode!
Kristin: We cut to outside The Bronze, Kate Leth. Where I think it's Buffy who says to Spike, "give it to me."
Kate: Mm. There are so many moments in this episode where I was just like, oh my god, I was 12! [laughter] The blood licking? I'm sorry, I almost came out here. [laughter]
Kristin: I mean, honest to god.
Jenny: [laughs] You were 12 watching this… cornography. [laughter]
Kate: Makes a lot of sense when you consider sort of how I turned out as a person.
Jenny: Uh-huh.
Kristin: Sure, yeah.
Kate: Yeah, but their whole—this—woof! The sexual tension in this episode! Off the chain. Off—mm!
Kristin: Would you like to be part of the Sexual Tension Award—
Kate: [laughs] Yes. Am I not really in spirit most of the time?
Kristin: Yeah. It's always—you truly always are, so hold on one second. I'm gonna bring us in and you can actually see on my notes who we're nominating. So if you wanna be a part of it, you can. Are you ready, everyone? [audience cheers] [SEXUAL TENSION AWARD jingle plays] Sexual tension award!
Kate: [laughs] It's so fun to have that in person! [laughter]
Kristin: Who would you like to—I have the four nominees that Jenny and I have decided on here. And we'll read a few, but why don't you pick, you know, one that speaks to you, Kate?
Kate: Oh my god, there's—I—mm.
Kristin: You can have two. You do one, then we'll go Jenny, then we'll go me, then we'll go you.
Kate: Okay. I'm going to, for maybe the first time in my life, actively choose the het pairings?
Kristin: Hey!
Kate: I'm sorry, it's Spike. He defies all logic.
Kristin: Yes. It's that pool table.
Kate: As I just said, the blood finger thing? Like…
Kristin: It's a lot.
Kate: It's a lot . [laughter] It's a lot. It—mmm. You know… I'm just—I've got just Jenny verbiage right now. [laughter] I'm gonna start some thoughts and not finish them.
Jenny: I find it helpful to do this. [laughter] And that can mean whatever you want it to mean.
Kristin: Grab the calming—cup the calming boob in your hand. [laughter] Take a deep breath.
Jenny: Be the invisible boob you wish to gently cup in the world. [laughter] As I always say.
Kate: I don't wanna get greedy.
Kristin: I can also see that someone's gonna have a picture of all three of us cupping an invisible boob down there. [laughter]
Jenny: Nice. Very nice.
Kristin: Okay, sorry, Kate, please.
Kate: There it is. So I was just gonna say, for a— effulgent . Is like—I'm a writer. That part is pretty good. So, yes. I will nominate Spike and Drusilla. [laughter]
Kristin: Okay! [audience cheers] This is a very jingle-heavy episode, and so since we never get the chance to talk about these two these days, we're just gonna—for Spike and Dru. [SPIKE & DRU jingle plays] They got a dark and creepy Ghoulish freaky kind of love They got a ropes and handcuffs Torture bloodlust kind of love They do, they do Spike and Drusilla!
Kate: Yeah! [audience cheers]
Kristin: Okay, that's our first nominee. Jenny, who are you nominating?
Jenny: [exhales] Well! Thank you for asking. [cackles] Is it gonna go me and then Kate again and then you?
Kristin: Actually, yes. [Jenny cackles] Let Kate have more of a choice in the matter.
Jenny: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
Kate: Sounds great.
Jenny: [laughs, clears throat] Then I choose to nominate… Spike… and Angel. [audience cheers] We've—I already did a whole thing, so I'm not gonna reiterate. But you know why. You know what they did. [laughter]
Kate: I certainly do.
Kristin: I think I know who I'm getting left with. [Jenny and Kate laugh]
Kate: Oh, yeah, have fun!
Kristin: It's alright, I'll take one for the team.
Kate: Traitor!
Kristin: Actually, I'll just take them so that you can end on a high note.
Kate: Perfect.
Kristin: I will nominate, by default… but also—Xander—
Kate: No, because you fully believe in it and you love both of these characters equally and you think they're the best ones on the show, please go on.
Kristin: I do. I—the bottom and the service bottom. [laughter] Xander and Riley with their boots. [laughter and applause] Thank you.
Kate: Which brings us, of course, [laughing] to the source of many a fan fictions lost to old computers. [laughter] If you could see them now! [laughing] I would get so cancelled. Anyway! [laughter]
Kristin: Wa-ha-ha-ha!
Kate: It's gotta be Spike and Buffy, baby.
Kristin: Yeah. [audience cheers] You can follow us @BufferingCast, we'll put up that Sexual Tension Award poll for you to enjoy, to vote upon. Or you can just look into our eyes right now and vote with your soul and we'll know. [laughter] Great. Something very special is going to happen tonight. Which is… I mean, listen, a lot of special things have already happened tonight. But. Kate Leth has never shared a stage with Joanna Robinson. [audience cheers]
Kate: Can you believe it?
Kristin: And—hold on, Joanna, stay where you are. [Kate laughs] Stay right there. Because I remembered—yesterday, I was like, Jenny, don't we have a jingle for Joanna? I forgot about it, and let me tell you, Scoobs. It's real good. So without further ado, I'm going to play Joanna's jingle as—whoo!—she walks out on stage right now. We ready? [audience cheers] 'Kay, here we go! [Joanna's jingle plays] Mmm, Joanna Robinson is here to talk to us To give her views on [inaudible over the cheering] [applause]
Kristin: Hi, Joanna Robinson!
Joanna: Hi!
Kate: Hi!
Kristin: Why—
Jenny: [quickly] Hi, Joanna Robinson.
Kristin: Is that a lock around your neck?
Joanna: Sure is!
Kristin: Hanging by a chain?
Joanna: By a thread. By… by pure cockney joy that we find is completely fake. Isn’t it nice to know why James Marsters' accent isn't perfect? You're like, oh, Spike's putting his accent on, I see. [laughter] That's not his accent. I also wondered if anyone here is thirsty. [audience cheers]
Kate: I think that you know that they are. [laughs]
Joanna: And I don't mean, like… [laughter]
Kristin: Everybody is thirsty, Joanna! [audience cheers]
Joanna: This is the—I'll stop hovering over you in a second, I promise.
Kate: No, it's fine, it's perfect.
Joanna: This is the perfect episode for us all to talk about, right? It is the objectively horniest episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. [laughter] Like, the sexual tension-iest episode. It has the most iconic Buffy fashion moment, so of course Kate is here for the origin of the coat. This is just… this is it, this is the episode! [audience cheers] And then, Kristin and I are here for all the Spike stuff and then Riley's here too, I guess, so yeah. [laughter] Something for everyone.
Kate: I feel like I have to start being a Riley apologist, just to give him a little more support, [laughing] but it's not gonna happen. [laughter]
Joanna: So wait, is anyone thirsty but like, actually thirsty? [audience cheers]
Jenny: Joanna brought something very special to the club tonight. [audience cheers] There's some O negative, there's some B negative. Those are the only types I've seen.
Joanna: Wait, I have a really important question for you guys.
Kate: Kate.
Joanna: It's… I think, one of the toughest questions of this episode. I've just been racking my brain. Can you guys think of anything that rhymes with "gleaming"? [laughter]
Kate: [laughs] That was the first thing Cohen said! [laughter] They've been being so good and then we got to that point and they were like, "so many things rhyme with gleaming!" [laughter]
Joanna: Steaming…
Kate: Reaming?
Joanna: Reaming…
Kristin: Wow! Just went right for it, Kate.
Kate: Like with paper! Obviously.
Kristin: Oh, sure.
Joanna: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or like a—yeah—oh no, that's something else. Anyway, yeah. So I—
Jenny: It's almost as if he's not a very good poet. [laughter]
Kate: Almost. Almost.
Joanna: Listen. Listen, you work "effulgent" into a stanza and then come talk to me. [laughter]
Jenny: Okay!
Kate: I will , Joanna! Challenge accepted.
Joanna: Yeah, challenge accepted. By both the songwriter—okay—and the writer up here. Yes.
Kristin: I have an idea based on this challenge, Joanna, which is that if you're listening to this podcast, or in this room with us, write the poem Spike should have written. Send it to us at bufferingthevampireslayer@gmail.com and the winner will get one of Kate Leth's posters. [audience cheers]
Kate: Oh-ho-ho! Oh my god, yeah, I'll sign one and just write the word "effulgent" on it. [audience cheers]
Kristin: Yes!
Kate: In really fancy handwriting too—
Joanna: Like a nice tattoo for Spike—
Kate: Yeah!
Joanna: "Effulgent" on the bicep, yeah.
Kate: Oh yeah, yeah, it's happening.
Kristin: Oh, beautiful. So yeah, get to work rhyming "gleaming," though. We're going without—you're gonna put "effulgent" on it.
Kate: It has to be… listen. I'm making the rules now.
Kristin: Yeah, please. [laughter]
Kate: Shorter than a sonnet, any—you know—pentameter that you choose. But it has to include a rhyme for "gleaming" and the word "effulgent." Those are the rules.
Joanna: Yeah. And I think if you do iambic, like, bonus points, right?
Kate: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, whatever poetry style speaks to you. [crosstalk]
Joanna: Sure. And if you can rhyme "Cecily," I applaud you. So, you know. Give it a whirl.
Kate: Yes. I'm very excited to read— [crosstalk]
Kristin: The winner gets the poster and Cecily. [laughter]
Joanna: Wow. Lucky you? I suppose?
Kate: Listen. Cecily's great.
Joanna: I will say, really quickly in defense of Cecily, Spike walks up to her and she's like, "oh no." [laughter] You know? She makes it really clear she doesn't wanna talk to him, and he's like, "oh, I know, they're all philistines. It's just us." And she's like, "no, no, no."
Kate: Every single time I see this scene, I think about Hey There, Delilah. [laughter] And how the girl it was written about was like, "this wasn't cool, I don't know you." True story. And so she had it follow her everywhere for years. They met, like, once at a party, the guy who wrote that song and her. And she's like, "I had a boyfriend. This is weird." And I always think about that when I see this scene.
Kristin: And her name was Delilah?
Kate: Delilah, yeah.
Kristin: Oh, god.
Kate: And then he wrote Hey There, Delilah and it became this huge hit and this girl who was Delilah—a kind of uncommon name—was like, "well, great." [laughter]
Joanna: It's gonna—yeah, it's gonna come on in a bar and she's just gonna be like, "oh, no."
Kate: How fun. Yeah. Pretty much.
Joanna: "It's that song about me again."
Kate: I'm sure sweet Caroline felt the same way. [laughter]
Kristin: So Joanna Robinson, for those of you who are listening and not seeing, is—you know, has bleached her hair blond.
Kate: Yeah, it looks incredible.
Kristin: Is wearing— [audience cheers] yeah. Who made that shirt, Joanna?
Joanna: Oh, I did. [laughter] Guys, have you ever bleached a shirt? 'Cause here's what's fun. You just take bleach and you intentionally put it on something. [laughter] Spike, as you know, has very little bleach on his shirt, but then I started bleaching and I couldn't stop and I was just like—and I did it with a plastic fork, did I tell you that part?
Kristin: No.
Joanna: No? Okay, so you take the bottle of bleach—DIY, guys. Take a bottle of bleach, dip a plastic fork in—I lost two plastic forks to the bottle in this process. [laughter] But like, by the time I got to the third fork, I was really good at it. And you just sort of flick the bleach—yeah. And then this hot mess happens. So, you know.
Kate: It's very good.
Joanna: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kate: It is very good.
Kristin: Well, and this is—I mean. I feel like I'm on stage with several Spike experts. Is this peak Spike?
Kate: Oh, yeah.
Kristin: Visually speaking? Is this peak Spike?
Joanna: No, like, there's no moment—no more aesthetically pleasing moment of Buffy the Vampire Slayer than when James Marsters, in this subway chic, looks up at the camera, right? [someone, probably Kate, groans] [audience cheers] Across the decades!
Kate: There is a reason I spent three and a half hours on his face! [laughter]
Joanna: 'Cause it's all—it's like, the subway fight's happening and you're like, well, this is hot and she rules and this is great. He looks great. Oh, she's got the coat, holy shit.
Kate: [intensely] And then he breaks the fourth wall.
Joanna: [laughing] And then he starts talking to her from the subway. His eyeliner is so smudged.
Kate: It's so much!
Joanna: And you're like, yes!
Kate: It's so much and then he's just like, hmm, maybe I'm the top for once. [laughter]
Kristin: Oh, yeah.
Joanna: He's not. He's not.
Kate: He's trying, though! Good for him!
Kristin: He's trying. He really is trying in this scene. He even snaps a subway pole in half.
Kate: Oh, that is pretty cool. That's pretty cool.
Kristin: Yeah. He's a top for, like, a second.
Kate: Yeah. It's so good—the transitions in this part is like—this is a fantastic episode. I love it so much, rewatching it is such a joy. It is in my top 10 if not top 5, I will say that. And they—it changes, over the years. But it's—ugh, so good. But the transitions that start to happen with, like, the clap when he comes back to the present day.
Jenny: Yeah!
Joanna: What does he say on that… ?
Kate: [simultaneously] Ugh! And then the subway pole turning thing—yeah. I don't know what he says on that clap, but it's a very good moment.
Jenny: [simultaneously] The second? The second.
Kristin: "The second!" [claps] "The second." [claps]
Joanna: Yes! So good.
Kate: Yes. Incredible—is the point where it's like, whoa, this is actually a really good episode. 'Cause you already know it, but that part is very—it's a standout Buffy moment for me.
Joanna: Good job, director whose name we mocked earlier because we didn't recognize it. [laughter]
Kristin: I didn't—! [clears throat] I didn't mean to mock it, I just had never heard it. I was—
Joanna: Well.
Jenny: I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure you've heard me say it before. [laughter] In the intro of our podcast that we host together.
Kristin: That's why I didn't hear it. [laughter]
Jenny: What the hell?
Kate: Was it Nick Mark?
Kristin: Yeah.
Kate: I'm great. [laughter and cheers]
Jenny: Another natural talent rises.
Kate: I just remember 'cause it's two first names. Yeah. It's great.
Joanna: Yeah. So yeah, Billy Idol Spike is amazing.
Kate: So good.
Joanna: Something that Cohen mentioned backstage is that this is the first—I believe, and you guys will be able to correct us if we're wrong—the first confirmation that Spike bleaches his hair. Even though we knew that wasn't natural, right? [laughter] But this is the first we see of William's natural brunette.
Kate: Is this is the first time we see William—?
Kristin: Oh, yeah.
Jenny: This is the first Spike flashback to William. But I believe he's been called Captain Peroxide already.
Joanna: Fair enough.
Jenny: But we hadn't gotten confirmation.
Kate: I think I wondered for a long time, when I was younger, because I was dumb, if Spike had bleached his hair and then died. [laughter] Not D-Y-E—
Jenny: Yeah! Hell yeah.
Kate: But like, had been killed and so his hair was just bleached forever. But that's not how that works.
Joanna: Because hair—here's the deal, right. Oh—no, your hair keeps growing after you die.
Kate: Yeah, 'cause vampires get different hair cuts.
Person in crowd: [inaudible] your skin shrinks!
Kate: This is true, but when you're a vampire—
Joanna: I'm so pleased and upset I just learned that information. [laughter]
Kristin: For the listener at home, somebody in the front row—very deservedly in the front row—was like "no, no, when you die, your skin shrinks." And said it with, like—are you a death doctor? [laughter]
Joanna: [laughing] A death doctor! Kristin!
Kristin: A what?
Person in crowd: I almost studied to be a forensic pathologist. [inaudible] chemistry.
Kate: That's still very impressive, you don't need to follow that up!
Jenny: Almost. Almost a death doctor.
Joanna: So when you die, your hair does not keep growing. So then, Spike never has to touch up his roots. But… but that's just quite a hair decision he made.
Kate: Okay, that would be the dream.
Joanna: But he made up—he made that hair decision—
Kate: This upkeep is a bitch.
Joanna: He made that hair decision, and then he's like, stuck with it. He fried his ends forever.
Kate: I think it probably—it changes. We see vampires over time—I actually don't know.
Jenny: Listen—
Kristin: Careful!
Jenny: There's confirmation later in the series… that vampire hair can grow.
Kate: Oh, right.
Joanna: I love the way you tiptoed through the tulips on that one, yeah.
Jenny: Spoiler, almost.
Kristin: And as someone in the audience said, meta-phitics. [laughter] Okay, so.
Joanna: Wait, wait. Follow-up question.
Kristin: Yes, please.
Joanna: Where were you when you found out that James Marsters A. was not British and B… [laughter] did not look quite the same without the bleached hair. With love.
Kate: I feel like it was… it's like a blacked-out memory?
Joanna: Yeah.
Kate: Of like—when something traumatic happens and you kinda just can't really process it.
Joanna: Yeah. Like someone spun a subway pole and hit you in the head. And you woke up months later, and you're like, "where am I?"
Kate: This is like when I found out that Dr. House was the same person from Jeeves and Wooster. [laughter] Which my parents had on a loop constantly when I was a child, alongside Monty Python. [a few cheers] Yeah! Yeah. Parents.
Joanna: [laughs] And you're like, "Bertie? What the…" Yeah.
Kate: Yeah, it was very weird. I was like, oh my god, he's not American. 'Cause the thing is, British people are so good at doing American accents. But if I could ever have three minutes to talk to David Boreanaz, I would be like… [laughter] "Do you even know where Ireland is ?" [laughter and applause] I can't even listen to him, 'cause he's like— [laughter]
Kristin: Actually, do you know who can tell you exactly what he's like?
Kate: Who?
Kristin: She's sitting right next to you. What does David Boreanaz do for Ireland?
Joanna: Oh, what is David Boreanaz's bad Irish—
Kristin: Yeah.
Joanna: Like, the Liam accent?
Kristin: Yeah.
Joanna: Oh, you know. It's like, [bad Irish accent] "diddly-aye potatoes." It's like, very bad. [laughter]
Kate: But it's like, he's got this [bad Irish accent] "weird overtone."
Joanna: [bad Irish accent] "Right, right."
Kate: Where it's like, [bad Irish accent] "What are you doing, William?"
Joanna: [bad Irish accent] "There's fear everywhere, I can hear it!"
Kate: [bad Irish accent] "We can't stay here!"
Joanna: [bad Irish accent] "It's fine! Why did I let them—let me wear this wig?" [laughter] "Repeatedly! Why?"
Kate: [bad Irish accent] "How much dry shampoo is in this? [laughter] It's standing a foot off me head!" [laughter] It's rough.
Kristin: And now you all know why we wanted them on stage together. [audience cheers] That shit took like, six minutes!
Joanna: I have a question. Do you think when they were filming this slow-mo, all four of our vamps walking towards camera—
Kate: I would kill, by the way, to see a version of it that's sped up to regular speed. [laughter] Please go on.
Joanna: Yeah. First of all, Marsters' wig does this flop thing? [laughter] That Jenny's hair did not do. Secondly, do you think Boreanaz is like, [pouting] "oh, I wanted to do the jump." [laughter]
Kate: Do you think they let him do one? [laughter] And be like, "aw, Dave. It's fine. We'll do a take, we might u  se it!" [laughter]
Joanna: Yeah. And they're like, "we're not gonna use it." [laughter]
Kate: And he's like, [deep voice] "wee!" [laughter]
Joanna: But like, Irish-er. [laughter]
Kate: [bad Irish accent, singing] "I'm flyin' higher than a leprechaun." [laughter] It's just so bad!
Joanna: It's very bad. It's very bad.
Kate: It's in my top 5 worst accents in film or TV—
Joanna: Yeah. It's above Peter Dinklage's Game of Thrones accent.
Kate: Julia Roberts' Mary Reilly.
Joanna: Oh, that's a good one.
Kate: Is it Kevin Costner in Robin Hood? [crowd reacts] Oh, Keanu Reeves in Dracula! [audience cheers] That's the best one! That's the best one.
Joanna: Yeah. No, what I respect about Kevin Costner… [laughter] is that he doesn't try t o do an accent. [laughs]
Kate: He doesn't, he gives up two scenes in.
Joanna: I don't think he even starts. He's just sort of like, [normal voice] "yeah, I'm Robin of Loxley. [laughter] Who are you? My estate! My father, the king." You're like, okay. I respect a lot about Kevin Costner, to be honest with you, so. [laughter] No, but here's—
Kristin: Kate is laying down on the table.
Joanna: But like, to go back to this—
Kate: It's just not every day you get to hear someone say, "here's a list of things I respect about Kevin Costner." [laughter]
Joanna: You guys, have you ever seen the Madonna documentary, Truth or Dare?
Kristin: Yes. [a few cheers]
Joanna: And then Kevin Costner comes backstage and he's like, "I liked your show, it was really neat." [laughter] Right? He says that, it's very polite. He's like, "I really liked your show, it was really neat." And she's like, "neat?!" I mean, I respect Madonna too, but she was like, "neat? Okay. Thanks." And then he leaves and then she goes, like this. A gag with the finger to Kevin Costner, and I was like, Madonna! [laughter] I respect you a lot, but he just said something nice about your show. So, yeah.
Kate: Kevin Costner stans, you out there? [laughs]
Joanna: They're really excited, all three of them are with me. [laughter] So, yeah. But to go back to the slow-mo shot. I feel like Boreanaz would be like, [bad Irish accent] "I'm the one with my own show. Me own show." [laughter]
Kate: [bad Irish accent] "I've moved to Los Angeles."
Joanna: [bad Irish accent] "It's called 'Angel.' Heard of it? I get to do the hop!"
Kate: [bad Irish accent] "I work with Cordelia!" [laughter]
Jenny: Dude, I know that you're both doing, like, a hilarious fake accent bit, but you both sound 100% better than David Boreanaz. [laughter and applause] It's fucked up.
Kate: [bad Irish accent] "Why, thank you." [laughter] Oh boy, okay, alright. Buffy.
Kristin: Wow. Wow. Okay, so that we may have our seats again.
Kate: Yes.
Kristin: Kate.
Kate: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Do you have any parting words for us? You're coming back before we leave, but—
Kate: Oh, good. Great. Yeah, I was just gonna like, head out.
Kristin: No, no, you gotta stay—
Kate: Got it.
Kristin: You gotta stay here, at least 'til the howl, okay?
Kate: Obviously.
Kristin: It's very important, we have a surprise for the howl. It's not James Marsters, everybody, keep in your seats. [laughter]
Jenny: Is that what everybody thinks a surprise is? [laughter]
Kristin: I don't know. I just—I had this moment one time where Tegan and Sara surprised everyone at a Pride party that I threw. And I've—every time I say there's a surprise now after that, I always feel like it won't be big enough.
Kate: Yeah.
Joanna: Literally, literally, what if Kristin and Jenny made you sit here for two hours, and listen to these chucklefucks… [laughter] while James Marsters was backstage? [laughter and applause]
Kate: He's just, like, chilling, playing Pokemon with Cohen.
Joanna: Sharpening his cheekbones. He's like, getting them nice and effulgent for you. [laughter] To come out to howl goodbye. [laughter]
Kate: Nothing would thrill me more.
Kristin: It takes a long time to sharpen cheekbones, Joanna. [laughter]
Kate: My last words… uh, boy. This one's a lot! This one's a lot. I mean, if you—I'm sure there are people who listen to this podcast who are listening to it being like, "oh, I watched Buffy a couple years ago, I remember enough about this but it's also a joy to be reminded of the things that I forgot." But if you have not watched this episode recently, please do yourself the favor of doing it again and being like, "wow, 12-year-olds watched this." [laughter]
Kristin: Did you have to watch it with a parental figure in the room?
Kate: Oh, it was a whole thing where my family watched it together.
Kristin: Wow.
Kate: Like, it was the only thing we watched together, other than Mystery Science Theater and Jeeves and Wooster and Monty Python. [laughs] [audience cheers] I am the way I am on purpose. [laughter] But yes, we watched it and because we lived in Atlantic Canada, we got it a day early. We got it on Monday nights instead of Tuesday, until it moved to whatever network, CW? What was it?
Joanna: Yeah, UPN. Oo-pin.
Kate: Oo-pin! Then it was on the same night as everyone else and we were no longer special. But it was—there were some uncomfortable moments, as you will say, with Spike, as the show develops.
Kristin: Yeah.
Kate: So yeah, just imagine being 12 and watching that with your parents. And… whew! [exhales into mic] Oh, wow. I'm sure that was a great sound. Okay, I'm gonna take that as my cue. Thank you. Thank you so much. [laughs]
Kristin: Kate—Kate Leth!
Kate: Thank you! [audience cheers]
Joanna: Yes! [Fashion Watch outro theme plays] That was our friend Kate She gave you the Buffy fashion update! [applause]
Kristin: One of my favorite parts of the Philly live episode was that we had—we said "until next time" and then the audience said "she'll see you at the mall," and I would love to do that again, just 'cause it was so much fun. Are you ready? Until next time…
Audience: She'll see you at the mall!
Joanna: You guys are great!
Kate: [at a distance] So cute! [laughter]
Kristin: Oh, we love it. Hi, Joanna!
Joanna: Oh hi, Kristin!
Jenny: Hey!
Joanna: Hey!
Kristin: Well, we're nearing the end of the episode here.
Joanna: Sure. Yeah.
Kristin: But you know, a lot of it was Irish accents. And I wanna—which was amazing. But I wanna—I don't know. We're like, here, and Spike is killing his second Slayer.
Joanna: Yeah. It happened. We all saw it. Once upon a time—wait, so. Kate—you know a lady never reveals her age. I will reveal my age, which is, you know—Kate was 12 when she watched this, I was 19. This episode aired 19 years ago, so it's exactly, like, my mid-life was watching this episode, I guess. [laughs]
Kristin: Spoooooky!
Joanna: Yeah. Yeah, I was in college. I made all—against their will, I made all of my roommates and friends and boyfriend and whatever watch Buffy. Like, all of them, every Tuesday, that's what we did. And I also remember, this crossover episode was such a big deal. That you think—you think you've experienced the slow-mo hop, but have you experienced until you've seen 1,000 promos for the crossover event of the century? Where everyone's gonna be wearing wigs and frock coats? [laughter]
Kristin: So are you—is no one on my team that the barrel hop is good? [audience cheers] Thank you. I mean, I'm okay to stand alone on the barrel—below the barrel, to catch Spike. Do you think that it's cute or sexy? [laughter]
Joanna: [laughing] Those are my options?
Kristin: Yep!
Jenny: Or goofy. [crosstalk]
Kristin: Goofy, cute or sexy.
Joanna: It's goof-tacular but then after that—
Kristin: The walk?
Joanna: No, but then after that, there's the subway and then you just forget. You're like, I don't remember anything that happened before the subway, really, after the subway—
Kristin: No one's willing to take 1900 barrel jumping Spike, but I'll take you. [laughter]
Joanna: His hair flops! It like, goes up and then down again. [laughter]
Kristin: He's committed to the moment! And the jump! Alright. Let's talk about the rest of this episode with Joanna Robinson, shall we? So the whole conversation is like, Spike being like, "listen. The only reason you fucking lasted this long is 'cause you have ties to the world," which is a thing that we hear a lot.
Joanna: He's like, "your family. The Scoobs." Right?
Kristin: He literally is like, "those Scoobs." [laughter]
Joanna: Those motherfucking Scoobs. Does not mention Riley, just saying. [laughter]
Kristin: Only one of us does, all the time. [laughter]
Jenny: Well, when I'm hitting on someone, I always try to bring up their current partner. [laughter]
Joanna: But like, Spike never misses a moment to make fun of Riley and/or other people—
Kristin: That's true.
Joanna: So I feel like—but then he also doesn't bring up Giles, which he should have. So anyway, it's—
Kristin: Well, but he says—he does say her family. Which could— [Joanna and Jenny squeal] [laughter]
Jenny: Kristin!
Kristin: Just saying.
Joanna: Remember when she was like, "you Watchers are all prudish" and then Giles was like, "no, I'd be devastated if you died was my point!" [audience "awws"] Yeah! This episode has everything! [laughter]
Kristin: It does, it really does.
Joanna: So Dad's sad and Mom's sick. Right?
Kristin: Yeah. So—and that's the thing. And we get a little taste of it at the beginning of the episode, right, where she's like, "hey, can you help me make this grocery list?" Not that she's sick, but just like, they pepper in, oh, Buffy's helping take care of the household in a few ways. And they do it again with the conditioner later on, like, "where's the conditioner?" "Did you check under the sink?" It's like, Buffy is saving the world and also—
Joanna: Follow-up question.
Kristin: Was that conditioner? No.
Joanna: Why is your conditioner under the sink? [laughter]
Jenny: Doesn't make any sense.
Kristin: Apparently, Joyce Summers has extremely effulgent locks.
Joanna: Then you need the conditioner in a more accessible location than under the sink. [laughter] If she had said, "where's my travel conditioner?" or whatever, but she was just like, "where's the conditioner?"
Kristin: Also, no conditioner has ever looked like that. It was definitely a bottle of shampoo. But yeah, Joyce is not doing well. She's going to stay overnight at the hospital, which is something that we learn towards the end of the episode. And… [sighs] are we there yet? We can't be there yet. Oh my god. First, before we get there, before we get to the fucking steps. Which just—I can't. A few things happen. [Joanna gasps] Yes?
Joanna: I just forgot—I just remembered that Harmony's in this episode.
Kristin: Yeah! Harmony is in this episode, but—
Jenny: She looks amazing! [laughter]
Kristin: She does, she really does.
Jenny: Look at that jumpsuit!
Joanna: Do you always shoulder-shimmy when you think about Harmony? Is that a thing you do, Jenny?
Jenny: I just shoulder-shimmy while I'm making this podcast. That's just the way it goes, Joanna. Can't be tamed. [laughter]
Kristin: So…
Jenny: Keep your fingers and extremities away from my shoulders, they could do anything at any time.
Joanna: They will be shimmying.
Jenny: They shall.
Joanna: Alright.
Kristin: Okay, so a couple things. We're in the fucking alleyway, after the story is told about the New York City Slayer. And Spike is like, "I'm gonna have myself—like, one of those days, you're gonna have a death wish. I'll slip in, have myself a real good day." And then he's like, "hit me." 'Cause, bottom. [laughter] And Buffy's like, "no." And then he's like, "Okay, so then like, I'll kiss you."
Joanna: You know who has a death wish? [laughter]
Jenny: Oh! Oh?
Kristin: Yeah.
Joanna: Like, you watch him do it and you're like, no! No!
Kristin: Stop, stop!
Joanna: Don't do it! You're not reading the signals properly, man. [laughter] 'Cause she was like—she's giving him very Cecily vibes, she's like, "noo! Noo!"
Kristin: Yeah. But the thing is, I've talked a lot about being in love with my best friend as a child. A child—a college-aged person. [laughter] And she would be like, "come over and watch Felicity" and I would be—and I would hear, like, [seductively] "come over and watch Felicity." [laughter] You know? It's hard when you have a crush, is all I'm saying.
Joanna: She's like, [seductively] "The Pink Ranger's in this one." Like that? [laughter]
Kristin: And then… Buffy has way more reason to be Cecily than Cecily does.
Joanna: Oh, yeah. She's a real Cecily in this moment, but… [laughter]
Kristin: Can we make that happen? "You're being a real Cecily right now!" But yeah, she says the same thing.
Jenny: Is this a coincidence, or did Spike include this phrase in the story?
Joanna: I imagine that Spike did, like, voices. [laughter] As he's telling the story.
Jenny: Including a really shitty Irish accent? [laughs]
Joanna: Yeah. Imagine Spike's Drusilla impression. [laughter] Yeah.
Jenny: Yeah. Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes.
Kristin: Oh, that's very good.
Jenny: Okay, so…
Kristin: So Spike is left on the floor of the alley, covered in money and his own tears.
Joanna: She didn't need to, like, throw the money. She crumples it and throws it. She could have just dropped—I don't know.
Kristin: I mean, to her defense, he just tried to fucking kiss her in an alleyway after telling her that she had a death wish. She's very overwhelmed.
Jenny: But you know, there's a lot of like, fish nor fowl vibes with the way that Buffy interacts with Spike. So I feel like it's very fair for him to maybe not—like, why is he alive? Why is he alive?!
Kristin: Yes, and also—
Jenny: He does more shitty things to them—like, has done more shitty things up to this point, historically, than not shitty things.
Kristin: Yeah and also, death and sex are always like, this close in Buffy the Vamp—I mean, maybe everywhere, I don't know. But in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you know, a vampire feeding on somebody is very sexualized. Spike cannot feed on any—there's all this—I was thinking, I wonder if he didn't have the chip in his head, if he would still be in love with Buffy. Or—I mean, I guess we actually get to a scene that talks about that in a second. But it's just like, is he as enamored with Buffy as he is because he cannot, like, kill her? Yeah, I hear your "hmm"s. [laughter]
Joanna: So. I don't know if I told this story on this podcast before, it's possible that I have. Because I've read only one single solitary Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan magazine, and it was something that a well-meaning grandparent or parent put in my stocking one Christmas. [laughter] They're like, "oh, she likes this."
Jenny: Aww!
Kristin: Aww!
Joanna: It's very sweet, yeah.
Kristin: That is very nice.
Joanna: But it was around Season 4, because it was about Anya and Spike becoming regulars and Marsters—James Marsters gave this interview where he's like, "In order to get screen time, you have to either try—be trying to kill her or kiss her." So… why not both, sort of thing. So, yeah.
Kristin: Right. Yeah, actually, when we talked to James, he talked a little bit about that. Like, that his… not that his way of staying on as the character of Spike, but that he knew that he couldn't just be bad to stay on the show. 'Cause if you're just bad, you know, your timeline is shorter. Which is why we're gonna get so complicated, aren't we? [singsong] Later! [normal voice] Anyway! In South America in 1998. There's a slime demon, what's it called? A chaos demon.
Jenny: Yes, a chaos demon, antlers, slime. Drusilla has to find her pleasures where she can because Spike tastes like ashes.
Kristin: I do love that Drusilla moment, though. Like, imagine turning to your maybe soon-to-be ex and being like, "Listen. I have to find my pleasure somewhere." [laughter] It's a bold statement, I really appreciate Drusilla for it.
Joanna: Can you blame a girl? PS. this chaos demon, what a sweetheart, right?
Kristin: Oh my god, he's—
Jenny: So nice!
Joanna: Oh my god, he's like, "I didn't know. I'll leave—you guys have things to work out, I'll be over here. Blotting my antlers."
Kristin: [simultaneously] How much laundry do you think this guy has to do? So—
Jenny: [laughing] Blotting my antlers! [laughter]
Kristin: But we learn in this scene that, of course, Spike tastes like ashes because he's been thinking about Buffy since he met Buffy. And I guess he could couch that in just like, "well, I just wanna kill the Slayer 'cause that's what I do, I kill Slayers." But Drusilla seems to tell us that that is not the full story.
Joanna: And we already know that she can pluck "effulgent" out of his head.
Jenny: Oh, true.
Kristin: Yeah!
Joanna: So she knows what he's thinking. She's not wrong.
Kristin: [sighs] So. Here we are. Joyce lost her conditioner. And she's like, "I'm gonna stay at the hospital overnight. I'm gonna be fine." She does not look fine, the makeup team is doing a great job. [laughter] And Buffy says—this is probably just about as Buffy as you can get. "I know you will." And then she goes outside and by herself, she sits down and she cries. Like, she's strong for Joyce and then she takes her moment by herself.
Jenny: And Spike…
Kristin: Uh-huh.
Jenny: Who's gone home, after drying his tears with his money. [laughter] And dug out a dusty old shotgun, which Harmony has questioned, deeply, his ability to use it effectively. And he rolls into the Summers' backyard. He would like to end his suffering, please. But, well, Buffy's crying. So then there's a lot of jaw clenching. And a lot of gentle face work. The eyebrows are in play, but just ever so slightly.
Joanna: The cheekbones are popping.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Yes! They! Are!
Kristin: They really are. And also, I know that there's a lot going on with James Marsters' face, but Sarah Michelle Gellar's fucking face.
Someone in crowd: Woo!
Jenny: Yeah…
Kristin: Right? I mean, the like… she has this look on her face that we've seen, as the viewer, I think, a couple times. Helpless came to mind, that episode. She's terrified and she is vulnerable in a way that she so rarely is. And when I saw it, I was like, okay, we've seen this but I don't think that Spike has ever seen this. I don't think he's ever seen her look like this. And it totally breaks him. So he sits down. Joanna, you get to play Buffy. Oh no, actually, I guess you should play Spike. Jenny will play Buffy.
Jenny: Finally. [laughter and applause]
Kristin: [laughs] To the listener at home, Jenny's doing a great—Jenny took her hair down. That's two live shows in a row that you've found a way to take your hair down. [laughter] [audience cheers]
Jenny: Oh, yes, okay!
Kristin: Spike sits down on the steps.
Jenny: I'm staring into the middle distance.
Kristin: [audience laughs throughout] Next to Buffy. And like a man who has not comforted a person in several hundreds of years, he picks up his hand. He places it gingerly on her shoulder. And he pat, pat, pats it. [laughter]
Jenny: Like a two-year-old little boy who just learned how to be gentle while petting a cat. [laughter and applause]
Joanna: Soft touch, soft, soft touch.
Jenny: Gentle!
Joanna: Soft, gentle, gentle. [laughter]
Kristin: And I think this is where we truly go off of the rails with—I mean, I know everyone here likes Spike. But Joanna, you and I are sort of notorious for our Spike love. And this is the moment we go off the Spike rails, for me. It's my moment of, I'm off now.
Joanna: No, I already—like, the eyeliner and the eye contact. [laughter] But yeah, this is a whole nother—yeah, thing. And he says—before the pat-pat, he says, "is there something I can do?"
Kristin: Ugh! [audience "aww"s] I'm so glad that you're here, groaning with us.
Joanna: I know! "Is there something I can do?" She doesn't even say anything. And then… he decides the thing to do is… [laughter]
Jenny: [sarcastically] I'm so comforted. [laughter] Thank you.
Kristin: And they're—you know, they're both wearing very similar—like, she's wearing baggy black clothes. He's wearing all black. There's just something visually—
Joanna: I wish I could visualize it. I wish there was some artistic representation of it. [laughter]
Kristin: Oh. Well, what do you know?
Joanna: Kate Leth—
Kristin: To the listener, we turned around, we looked at the poster behind us that Kate Leth has designed.
Joanna: Kate Leth!
Kristin: So. I don't—sometimes we do an episode and I don't wanna let it go. That's how I felt when we were doing Hush. You know? I was like, "oh no, once we stop talking about it, we're done talking about it." And this is one of those episodes. We have Kate Leth and Joanna Robinson? To talk about Fool For Love? How are you doing out there? [audience cheers]
Jenny: A blessed day.
Kristin: We have something… Kate, Kate, come on back out, Kate. [audience cheers]
Kate: Hi.
Kristin: Yes, share a microphone with Jenny.
Jenny: Oh, yes.
Kate: Hi, hi, hi.
Kristin: We have some—wait. So you know how the podcast ends, don't you?
Joanna: James Masters is here?! [laughter]
Kristin: Wouldn't you feel the fool if he was? Um, so we are going to howl out and we have something—because—let's just give another round of applause to the Brava Theater for having us tonight. [applause] This is a space that exists to champion women's voices, LGBTQ voices, POC voices, marginalized voices. So we are honored to be here, and if you live in this area, you should come back and support them. If you don't, you should just travel to the Bay Area 'cause it rules and come and see some stuff at the Brava Theater. [audience cheers] San Francisco, we ask you to howl out with us, and Kathy up there running the lighting has something special for us to howl out to, don't you, Kathy? [audience cheers]
Jenny: Well, well, well, well, well.
Kristin: For the listener, so you don't feel left out, [lowers voice] the lights have gone down. There's above lighting that looks like the sky. And behind us is a moon with some stars.
Jenny: Would you say that moon is effulgent? [laughter]
Kristin: I would say—
Joanna: It's gleaming!
Kate: I would say that moon is ef- full-g  ent 'cause it's— [laughter]
Jenny: True. It's a full-ass moon.
Joanna: Is there a bulge in it? [laughter]
Jenny: No, no, no, no, no, no.
Kate: You've gone too far!
Kristin: Are you ready, San Francisco? [audience cheers]
Jenny: Thank you all so much for joining us on this magical evening. Until next time…
Everyone: Awwwoooooooooo!
Kate: [laughs] Hell yeah.
Kristin: Thank you!
Jenny: Beautiful! [applause and cheering] [Jenny performing "Fool For Love" off the album Songs from Season 5 by Buffering the Vampire Slayer. Lyrics here .]
