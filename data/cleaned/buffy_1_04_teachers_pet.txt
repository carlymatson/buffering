Buffering the Vampire Slayer
Episode 1.04: Teacher’s Pet
[Theme Music]
Jenny: Hello and welcome to Buffering the Vampire Slayer , a podcast where we’re watching and discussing every episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer , one at a time. I’m Jenny Owen Youngs.
Kristin: And I’m Kristin Russo, and this week, we’ll be discussing Season 1, Episode 4, "Teacher’s Pet." [laughter]
Jenny: Stay tuned at the end of this episode for a song that will recap the episode after we finish talking through recapping the episode.
Kristin: Mm-hmm.
Jenny: So many recaps, so little time.
Kristin: My first question is, do you have plans to put Xander’s sweet, sweet guitar solo into your song? [laughing]
Jenny: [laughs] Like, the actual melodic guitar solo? Or referencing his guitar solo lyrically?
Kristin: I meant– no, no, no, I meant the actual guitar solo, whether via sample or playing it yourself.
Jenny: Well–
Kristin: It’s too–
Jenny: Legally–
Kristin: Legally?
Jenny: And also, technically–
Kristin: Really, you think that somebody has, like, the rights to that song?
Jenny: Well, the actual sound clip, we couldn’t use. I don’t think I’m gonna be able to play that.
Kristin: Wow.
Jenny: And I’m certainly not gonna devote my time to learning it.
Kristin: Do you at least like my idea, or are we having a business meeting right now?
Jenny: I love your idea. I forgot that we weren’t having a business meeting.
Kristin: Yeah, you did. You were like, "Ahem, ahem, ahem."
Jenny: "Ahem, ahem, ahem." I was tightening my tie, got my abacus, put it on the desk.
Kristin: [important voice] "Well, you see, this is how music works?"
Jenny: [important voice] "Thank you for coming by, Ms. Russo."
Kristin: There went my whole joke. [Jenny laughs] Down the tubes, to the profession of music.
Jenny: I am deeply shamed.
Kristin: Man, I have so many notes for this episode.
Jenny: I have a lot of notes, too.
Kristin: I don’t even– I took some notes that were more general about things I wanted to talk about, and then I had so many specific notes that I don’t even know where to begin.
Jenny: Why don’t we try to go generally chronologically? Ish.
Kristin: Right, well I start with the teaser, cold open, and have a note to talk about the credits, as well, like–
Jenny: You’re saying, Xander’s daydream, and then also the credits.
Kristin: Yeah, no, I’m talking about like, [music begins] "In every generation, there is a chosen one. She alone will stand against the vampires, the demons, and the forces of darkness. She is The Slayer." [music ends]
Jenny: Pretty tight.
Kristin: Which I wrote down, ‘cause I was like, "Well this, we should talk about this!"
Jenny: Yeah, I think that that’s at the beginning of every episode of Season 1.
Kristin: Mm. And then it goes away?
Jenny: I think so? But we’ll find out.
Kristin: I guess we’ll have to wait. Anyway, I just wanted to talk about that, and then the credits, which we haven’t really talked about, either.
Jenny: We sure haven’t.
Kristin: [sings the BtVS theme] You know?
Jenny: Great song by Nerf Herder.
Kristin: We see lots of clips so we have, like– I feel like if you’re an avid viewer, you’re watching– I used to always watch the opening sequence of shows, especially in the beginning, because I knew that they were pulling from future episodes–
Jenny: Right, right, and you wanted some clues–
Kristin: Yes! I might be able to glean some clues about what was to come.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah.
Kristin: And little by little, we’re ticking them off.
Jenny: Yeah, we’ve seen the cat jump out of the chest in "Witch"–
Kristin: Yep, and the cauldron is also in the credits.
Jenny: Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Kristin: Mm-hm, and then, I think the crucifix necklace is in– [Jenny laughs] the credits, which is obviously the first episode.
Jenny: Plus, they’ve gotta really get their money’s worth out of that shot.
Kristin: But there’s some, like, you know, looks between some characters, and some stuff that happens that I noticed that I was like, "Ohhh, foreshadowing!"
Jenny: What, what are you– anything you saw that you want to talk about?
Kristin: No, no, no, like, what if they’re watching for the first time? They can watch the credits themselves, you know what I mean?
Jenny: Absolutely, draw their own conclusions.
Kristin: I’m talking to you out there. [laughter] But yeah, so you know– and then, I do want to talk about Xander’s dream, though. I’m sure you want to talk about that.
Jenny: Oh lord, have mercy.
Kristin: Two feminists, in a room. [Jenny laughs] Dealing with Xander’s dream.
Jenny: Ohhh, man. Well, listen, who among us didn’t want to rescue a pretty girl– [Kristin laughs] when we were in high school?
Kristin: Two queer feminists, in a room.
Jenny: Or junior high, or elementary school, or preschool, or potentially, in the womb.
Kristin: Were you having dreams about rescuing damsels in distress in preschool?
Jenny: Maybe not preschool but like, early elementary school.
Kristin: Yeah, you seem like the type.
Jenny: Thanks, I think. [laughs]
Kristin: [laughs] But yeah, this is like, classic, classic damsel in distress desire dream here.
Jenny: Right, right, right.
Kristin: And I love how like– I love how slapstick funny it gets, ‘cause it’s not even just like, Xander daydreaming about saving Buffy, but then he's like, [sleazy voice] "Yeah, I can do my solo and still be back in time to kiss ya." There’s like, so many– or whatever he says– but there’s like, so many layers. He not only wants to make out with Buffy, but also he’s the best guitar player– best guitar solo-er in all the land.
Jenny: Right, right, right, but do you feel like that’s a– that’s just part of his daydream because it’s part of what makes him desirable to Buffy in his daydream?
Kristin: I don’t think Buffy’s given us any indication that she is attracted to sweet guitar soloists.
Jenny: Who isn’t attracted–
Kristin: I took that more as like, the masculine desire to be one of many things, and like, a rock star, a savior–
Jenny: Mm, okay.
Kristin: You know, all those things, it was very– ooh, what did I write about it? Oh, I just said, the everyman dream of being, like, the woman’s savior and playing– [laughing] and then my note was, "Every man’s dream of being her savior and playing a guitar solo, oh man, oh man, oh men, am I right?" That was my full note.
Jenny: [laughs] "Oh man, oh man, oh men, am I right."
Kristin: But then you kind of under– you kind of upended that by telling us that of course, you were having the same kinds of fantasies.
Jenny: Right, right, right, right.
Kristin: So.
Jenny: Sorry for upending that.
Kristin: No, I mean I think it’s a very interested– interes ting upending.
Jenny: Um, [laughs] I was gonna say, "While I was having those fantasies without the benefit of male privilege," but then I was like, are we gonna say "male privilege" on this podcast?
Kristin: Well, we did say we were gonna try to say "patriarchy" once every episode.
Jenny: And that’s the one!
Kristin: So!
Jenny: Moving right along! [Kristin laughs] I love the science teacher.
Kristin: Oh, man! What a short-lived love it was!
Jenny: He believes in Buffy!
Kristin: [sighs] I took some like, real-time notes this time around, like, where I was writing as I– ‘cause I don’t know, I did not know this episode, like– I didn’t know what was gonna happen. And after I talked about Buffy’s lip gloss, which we can get back to in a minute, I wrote, "Oh, this teacher is so nice, don’t let him be a demon! No! He’s gonna be a demon! Is he an ant? Oh no, he got attacked by an ant!" That was– [laughs]
Jenny: [laughs] Wow, what a beautiful window into your mind.
Kristin: That was what was happening, yeah, I just wrote it down. I have one more– later, I’ll have another stream of consciousness.
Jenny: Great.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Wait, but tell me about Buffy’s lip gloss.
Kristin: I just like– so as Buffy goes over to talk to the teacher– what’s the teacher’s name? Do you know?
Jenny: The science teacher’s name is Dr. Gregory.
Kristin: Dr. Gregory. So as Buffy’s going to talk to Dr. Gregory, there’s like a, you know, a nice close-up– yeah, we see many close-ups of Buffy’s face, and her lip gloss looked so on point. And it made me think back to my lip gloss days, you know, I mean, I had some serious lip gloss days. I don’t know if you bypassed that in your life, but–
Jenny: I didn’t have too many lip glosses–
Kristin: I loved a lip gloss. I had many, many, many different kinds of lip gloss, and the pinnacle lip gloss for me was– I can’t remember the name of it, it was like– it was not called "Lip Demon," but for some reason, that’s what just came into my head. And it had like, a plumper in it or something?
Jenny: Oh, lord.
Kristin: So it like, burn– it would like, burn your lips–
Jenny: Eek!
Kristin: It would make them super shiny and full. And I felt like maybe Buffy was rocking that. I don’t know, I can’t remember what it was called, but that’s my lip gloss sidebar.
Jenny: Who knew that there was plumping lip gloss? I’m so uncomfortable right now.
Kristin: Oh yeah, I know. And who knows what was in it? What was I putting on my mouth?
Jenny: Oh god.
Kristin: But yeah, so, this teacher. We love him. He loves Buffy!
Jenny: He believes in her!
Kristin: Ugh!
Jenny: He thinks she can do anything! He doesn’t care about her permanent record!
Kristin: He doesn’t! And it’s like–
Jenny: What a guy.
Kristin: You know, taking that through the whole episode, I just felt like, they showed you so many times during this episode how much it meant to her as a student and as a person to have had just one person believe in her. Which I felt was really cool and obviously point– and obviously spot on, it was just like, "Wow, this person believed in her and she’s doing her homework!"
Jenny: Mm-hm. And it’s paying off!
Kristin: And how proud was Willow?
Jenny: So proud!
Kristin: When Buffy is in the library, and she’s like, "I’m gonna do my homework" and it cuts to Willow, and Willow is like–
Jenny: Just beaming with pride!
Kristin: Beaming!
Jenny: So lovely.
Kristin: It was a great moment. But yeah, I mean, I don’t know, do we wanna talk any more about that teacher? Or that was it?
Jenny: Well, I’m sad he’s dead. I’m sad that he had to have his head eaten by the mantis! Now I’m wondering– my first note was, "Is Dr. Gregory a virgin?" Because I remember that she specifically–
Kristin: Oh, yeah!
Jenny: Was luring virgins, right? And then I was like, oh, maybe she was just hungry, and she needed to get him out of the way in order to become the substitute so she could start luring boys home. But then in the very very last scene of the episode–
Kristin: Oh right, we see–
Jenny: There are eggs in the science lab, so... where’d those eggs come from?
Kristin: So, does that then mean that he was a virgin?
Jenny: That’s what I’m wondering! And, not to get too far ahead of myself, but is he being considered a virgin perhaps because–
Kristin: [gasps]
Jenny: He is a gay Dr. Gregory?
Kristin: Right.
Jenny: And in the 90s, that might mean you were a virgin to some people or large bugs?
Kristin: Or maybe to a praying mantis, that means you’re a virgin? [laughs] To people? Maybe it isn’t even societal, maybe praying mantises are just–
Jenny: It’s more specie-al?
Kristin: It’s more like, if you’ve fertilized another’s eggs–
Jenny: Right. Ooh. [whispers] Oh, science, I love you.
Kristin: Yeah, like maybe that’s what it is. But that’s a very astute observation. You’d almost think that you’d watched this episode four hundred thousand times. I didn’t even think about that.
Jenny: Well, that’s where I’m at.
Kristin: Oh, so I wanted to talk about The Bronze.
Jenny: Mmm.
Kristin: We get to go to The Bronze a couple of times in this episode, which is always very exciting to me because I find The Bronze to be one of the main characters in this show.
Jenny: Right, right, right.
Kristin: As I mentioned on the first episode. And this band, you said they are a real band that was playing?
Jenny: It looks like that band is called Superfine, and we hear them perform "Already Met You," we see them perform "Already Met You" and then later we hear them perform "Stoner Love."
Kristin: Oh wow!
Jenny: And the songs are from their EP Superfine .
Kristin: Well, Superfine!
Jenny: "Already Met You" also appeared on Buffy the Vampire Slayer , the album.
Kristin: Ohh! We should get that album. Why do you not have that album?
Jenny: It’s a mystery.
Kristin: Yeah, whew! But that– okay, so that’s exciting. First of all, "Already Met You," great song choice for when Angel is back at The Bronze.
Jenny: Wooo!
Kristin: And not to get too ahead of myself, because that wasn’t even my first note, but what a cut. What a reveal.
Jenny: Mmmm.
Kristin: What a hunk.
Jenny: Such a hunk.
Kristin: The note that I made was about the silver shirt that the band leader’s–
Jenny: I made that note too.
Kristin: Tell me what you were thinking.
Jenny: I was thinking like, did I have that shirt or something similar at some point, because Hot Topic, probably.
Kristin: Yes, and I did have– [Jenny laughs] that was my note, was I had not that shirt, but it was a silver shirt, and it was my fav– I had an outfit that I was obsessed with, and I went to see Bush in concert–
Jenny: Oh boy.
Kristin: And I wore my silver shirt, similar to the one that that gentleman is wearing, underneath my overalls– [Jenny laughs] with heels, or like, chunky heels that were clear. The shoe was clear. Like, Coke Zero or whatever the hell that– like, totally see-through, and the heel was silver and the laces were silver.
Jenny: Good lord.
Kristin: I looked... great.
Jenny: Right. That was the concert where you think Gavin Rossdale made a bunch of eye contact with you, right?
Kristin: I’m con– he did.
Jenny: Mm-hm.
Kristin: Look, he definitely– I stood on the chair in the theater, and he looked into my soul.
Jenny: I bet, I bet.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: What do you think he saw there?
Kristin: A beautiful girl in a silver shirt. [laughter] But yeah, so that was my–
Jenny: And he was probably like, "Hey, is that Rob from Superfine?"
Kristin: [laughs] Yeah, I can clear up the mystery for him after all these years.
Jenny: You’re welcome, Gavin!
Kristin: And then, you know, I think a very important thing that happens at The Bronze before we cut to Angel, my note of which is "OMG Angel", is Xander and this guy, Blayne–
Jenny: Blayne.
Kristin: Blayne.
Jenny: Ugh.
Kristin: Right?
Jenny: The worst!
Kristin: Yeah, and this moment between them is just wretched.
Jenny: It’s crushing.
Kristin: With Blayne being like, "I banged this girl, and then I banged this other girl, and I banged all the girls!" And then Xander, instead of just being like, "Oh, that’s a rude way to talk about women." [laughter] Xander does not do that.
Jenny: No, instead he responds like a boy in high school.
Kristin: Yeah, I know, and that’s what I– I kept having to talk myself down.
Jenny: Right, right.
Kristin: Like, you know, this is supposed to be, like, an accurate portrayal of boys in high school.
Jenny: And look at them go. At least he’s not like Blayne, and he’s just like Xander.
Kristin: Right, right. So they have this moment, really setting the scene for the rest of the episode, because this whole episode is like– hinges on masculinity and like, the need for boys and men to feel that they are possessing masculinity, whether in the form of like, not being a virgin or being tough or playing a sweet guitar solo.
Jenny: Right, right, right, but it’s also about flipping the script and taking that power and giving it to a lady or a mantis.
Kristin: Right? Ohh. What a lovely wordplay!
Jenny: Oh, I wasn’t even thinking about how the first half of "mantis" is "man," but that’s interesting.
Kristin: Um, no, that’s the whole thing though, right? Like, the core of this is this challenged, fragile masculinity and then, I mean, you know, we say this– this is only the fourth episode of this podcast, but I feel like we’re constantly talking about how that’s flipped. It’s flipped.
Jenny: Right, right, right, right.
Kristin: And so this episode does that just that. It brings in–
Jenny: In maybe my favorite way so far: "Oh, you wanna have sex with me? Get a load of this!"
Kristin: [laughs] Yeah, it’s pretty good. It’s pretty good. I have a little– I had a little moment before we meet– speaking of praying mantis– before we meet Ms. French, Giles has a moment that–
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kristin: Do you know what I’m talking about?
Jenny: Yeah. I think we took all the same notes.
Kristin: Well, okay, that’s good, that’s helpful, because otherwise this episode would be six hours long, if we both took a lot of notes. But there’s a moment where Giles is like, "Yeah, sunny– it’s sunny here every day," and like, rolls his eyes and he’s so disgusted with California. And I fell in love with Giles in that moment as a new Los Angeles transplant from the east coast. You know, he’s coming from overseas, where it’s grey and rainy. But I’m coming from the east coast where it can at least be grey and rainy, and can be cold or hot, you know, it can be many things. And I’m really struggling to acclimate to this, you know, constant sun and the lack of a change of season.
Jenny: Right.
Kristin: So I really identify–
Jenny: You were really feeling it.
Kristin: I was really feeling it. I was like, "Giles, me too, man. LA’s weird." [laughs] So, that’s all. A little moment. And then in comes the teacher.
Jenny: Whew! Up she walks, on the sidewalk. And that... unfortunate music starts thrumming in the background, sort of like vaguely tribal sound?
Kristin: Really? I don’t remember.
Jenny: Sort of like, tribal drumming, which I feel like is supposed to signify Xander’s, you know, sort of primal urges–
Kristin: Oh boy.
Jenny: Rising up in his nether regions.
Kristin: Gross .
Jenny: Sorry.
Kristin: I don’t know if we should ever say "Xander" and "nether regions"– [Jenny laughs] in the same breath. Personal preference. Personal preference. But yeah, and then there’s Blayne again, and Xander, like this whole– this is a horrible way to say this, but the note I took was, "God, this episode is just one big dick fight between Blayne and Xander." [laughter] It’s just like, Xander being like, "I’m a dude," and Blayne being like, "I’m more of a dude." "I’ll show you where that science classroom is, it’s right here next to the field where I won that award with my penis."
Jenny: Speaking of which, I’m guessing then that Blayne has been like, left back or something, or is taking last year’s science class, because he’s saying he led his team to victory the previous year, but Xander, Buffy and Willow are taking– aren’t they taking freshmen classes?
Kristin: Oh, are they fresh– see, I don’t even know what year they are.
Jenny: Maybe they’re sophomores. I’m sorry, they’re sophomores. But wow, he was on varsity in freshman year, now I’m impressed.
Kristin: He’s– Blayne got you.
Jenny: He got me.
Kristin: [laughing] Jenny will go home with you, Blayne.
Jenny: Blayne!
Kristin: And then right away, as soon as we get into the classroom, I was like, "Oh, she’s a praying mantis."
Jenny: [laughs] There was just like, mantis paraphernalia everywhere! There was like, a computer print-out of like, a close-up of a mantis face taped up on the wall. She’s got one– now that’s kind of weird and reminds me of the episode of BoJack Horseman we just watched, with the people– friend-chickens and food-chickens?
Kristin: Oh, the chickens? Yeah.
Jenny: There’s this gigantic praying mantis carrying around a regular praying mantis in a little terrarium thing.
Kristin: Oh, man. That praying mantis must have been like, shitting itself. You know? Like, [shakily] "What the fuck?"
Jenny: Yeah, I guess she wouldn’t hesitate to eat a miniature version of her own kind if she’s regularly biting off the heads of her mates.
Kristin: Oof.
Jenny: Be they human or mantis.
Kristin: You know, I know we’re early on in the series, but the construction of the demons and the bad things is really– it really gets me to my core, especially when we start to peel it apart, and like, you’re like, talking about her? She is very upsetting in a lot of ways.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, that 360-degree head spin, or 180-degree head spin, I should say.
Kristin: Yes! And like, good casting.
Jenny: Yeah, I feel like the actor is just–
Kristin: She’s like, perfect.
Jenny: She really nailed it.
Kristin: Do you think she walked in and they were like, "Well! You got it!"
Jenny: She is, what is her name? Her name is Musetta Vander.
Kristin: Oh– wha– for real?
Jenny: Uh-huh.
Kristin: Musetta.
Jenny: And she’s from South Africa, which you can sort of hear at various points, you can hear a touch of an accent, but it sounds like she’s trying to keep it pretty American-sounding?
Kristin: Oh, interesting, I actually– I didn’t know where she was from, and I thought she was doing a very, very mild accent. ‘Cause I did notice the accent, for sure.
Jenny: I could be also totally wrong.
Kristin: Yeah. Who knows?
Jenny: Maybe that’s just like, where she’s at.
Kristin: Right. Right. I also– obviously we’re gonna talk about this praying mantis teacher a bunch, but I did want to say I really appreciated another little– I’m here to pull out the feminist moments in Buffy the Vampire Slayer , but you know, Blayne and Xander are outside and they’re like, volleying for this teacher. And Xander has a moment where he can’t think of where the science room is, and he looks to them– [Jenny laughs] and he’s like, "Could you help me out? Could you?" And they’re like–
Jenny: And Buffy and Willow are just like, "Absolutely not, bro! Good luck!"
Kristin: They just shake their heads!
Jenny: "Good luck!"
Kristin: It was really nice, it was really nice.
Jenny: I feel like it’s worth mentioning too, like while we’re talking about casting, I feel like Price Jackson, who plays Blayne Moll, is pretty amazing casting for like, that douche you hate in high school?
Kristin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. Also, though, be careful of your usage of the word "douche"–
Jenny: [gasps]
Kristin: [laughs]
Jenny: How would you describe him?
Kristin: I mean, no, obviously, he’s the worst–
Jenny: No, no, no, redacted, redacted!
Kristin: He’s the worst, but you know, whatever.
Jenny: Thank you for helping me help myself.
Kristin: Also, we know right in the start of this scene that Blayne is totally fucked, right? Like–
Jenny: Oh, you can’t be that big of a jerk... and survive.
Kristin: Yeah, and she’s going for him first.
Jenny: Right, right, right. [Kristin laughs] Wait, I’m sorry.
Kristin: Yeah, no– please, go ahead.
Jenny: I wanted to say, when she’s teaching her first class, I love this moment where she’s saying, "The mantis is forced to live alone. Who can tell me why? Buffy?" And I feel like, Ms. French sensed something in Buffy–
Kristin: [gasps]
Jenny: That there was something in Buffy that kept her apart from her fellow students and teenagers.
Kristin: Oh wow. I missed that line! I didn’t even– I was not even aware of it. That’s very– I like that.
Jenny: I’m like, very insightful about this episode!
Kristin: You really are! You’re picking the good notes. I put from that same scene, where she’s like, "And then the mantis–" And then she’s like, very sexually describing–
Jenny: Mm-hm, yes.
Kristin: What’s happening with the mantis, and I thought, did Isabella Rossellini watch this–
Jenny: Oh wow.
Kristin: Episode and get her inspiration for her series, what is it called?
Jenny: Green Porno.
Kristin: Green Porno. Because it like, might as well have been the praying mantis episode of–
Jenny: [fancy accent] "If I were a mantis–"
Kristin: Yeah!
Jenny: Yeah, totally.
Kristin: Right? So–
Jenny: Actually, I wonder if there is a mantis episode of– I think there is, ‘cause of the head biting–
Kristin: Yeah, no– we’ve seen it!
Jenny: Oh, you mean specifically that episode. I’m catching up here. I just thought you meant like, conceptually. Wow, wow, wow.
Kristin: No, no, I think the first episode of Green Porno that I saw was the praying mantis episode.
Jenny: Nice!
Kristin: And so this was like, oh man! This is the same thing! They could have cast her to play the mantis.
Jenny: Couple things about the cafeteria.
Kristin: Ooh!
Jenny: Hot dog surprise! [noise of disgust]
Kristin: [laughs] And then the only thing that might be worse than hot dog surprise is your headless teacher in a fridge.
Jenny: Oh right, but in between those two things, there’s another low point, which is Blayne saying he’s "carbing up" for his after-school session with Ms. French. [vomit noise]
Kristin: Ughh. God.
Jenny: So sick.
Kristin: Oh boy.
Jenny: Okay, so if anybody was gonna find a body, wow, I’m so glad it was [yells] Cordelia !
Kristin: So glad it was Cordelia! [intensely] Insert Cordelia song.
NOTES: ["Cordelia" Jingle plays] Cordelia! (ah-ahh) I love you, Cordelia! (ah-ahh) You’re perfect, Cordelia! (ah-ahh)
Kristin: Yes, here she is, this is her first entrance in the episode, I believe, ‘cause I wrote in all-caps, "Cordy."
Jenny: Yeah, she’s only in two scenes, right? She’s– we see her discover the body, and then we see her in with the counselor. But she really makes very limited screen time count in this episode.
Kristin: She really does. What a scream. What a scream.
Jenny: Yeah. That’s up there.
Kristin: It is up there. Patricia Arquette still holds the award, episode three of Nightmare on Elm Street.
Jenny: There’ll be no toppling Patricia Arquette–
Kristin: No, no.
Jenny: But Charisma Carpenter, holding her own.
Kristin: Yeah, that was a great scream, and it came right on the heels of us finding out that every day, Cordelia goes into the kitchen to get her medically prescribed lunch! [laughter] I love her!
Jenny: I love her too! What do you think’s in there? Do you think she’s on the Whole30?
Kristin: Definitely. She’s way ahead of the curve. She started the Whole30 in ‘97. For sure. [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah, yeah. Then we go right to Buffy and Willow and Xander in the library with Giles. Once again, tumbleweeds in the library. Only the Slayerettes meet there.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: And Giles gives Buffy a glass of water, and then he goes and get his death newspaper! [Kristin laughs] He’s always got a death newspaper ready to shake in their faces and say, "Well, these people died, and this person’s missing, and oh my goodness."
Kristin: Right? I mean, you know, they have to have some character touchstones, that’s Giles, Giles always is reading the death paper. For Xander, Xander’s always wearing his sweater with a stripe in it, which also appears in this part of the episode.
Jenny: Speaking of wardrobe, is it just me, or is Fork Guy the Vampire kind of dressed like he just got off shooting an episode of Xena, Warrior Princess ?
Kristin: Do you know who I thought of when I saw Fork Guy? Is– you know the movie Hocus Pocus?
Jenny: I thought you were gonna say, "You know the movie Predator ?" And I was gonna be like, "Yeah, exactly!" Hocus Pocus ?
Kristin: Hocus Pocus! Remember– I can’t remember his name, he’s one of my favorite characters.
Jenny: The guy with his mouth sewn shut?
Kristin: Yeah yeah yeah! He looks– he’s like, styled the same.
Jenny: Really?
Kristin: Except for he has a scissor hand, I don’t know.
Jenny: I didn’t see that.
Kristin: He’s all, like, dusty, with these, like... matted pieces of hair.
Jenny: Mm-hm.
Kristin: For those of you listening, who were confused about my silence, I was wiggling in my chair, and wiggling my hands above my head to show Jenny–
Jenny: So just picture that–
Kristin: His hairstyle.
Jenny: And you’ll have an idea of what’s going on here.
Kristin: But yeah, Scissor Hand Guy– sorry, I shouldn’t call him that. We don’t want to confuse him with Edward.
Jenny: Fork Guy.
Kristin: Fork Guy. Fork Guy is a very likeable character in this episode.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, he’s definitely a villain.
Kristin: It was hard for me to understand him as a vampire, because he didn’t seem like one because of his fork hand.
Jenny: And because of his leathery, like... horse-lord outfit.
Kristin: Oh. Speaking of leathery–
Jenny: Yeah! He looked like a Dothraki!
Kristin: Okay.
Jenny: Okay, sorry.
Kristin: I’m gonna let you have that moment for yourself.
Jenny: I’m done, I’m done.
Kristin: You good?
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Leathery just made me remember back to the scene where we saw Angel for the first time.
Jenny: [pants excitedly]
Kristin: Jenny! This is why we never see that amazing leather jacket again! That she wore to a coup–
Jenny: Because she’s wearing Angel’s jacket for the rest of the time.
Kristin: Yes! She takes Angel’s jacket!
Jenny: Here’s a thing. Let’s think about this realistically. Sarah Michelle Gellar is what, like, five-one? Five-two? [Kristin laughs] And David Boreanaz is like, I think he’s around six feet tall.
Kristin: Yeah, yeah. There’s a bit of a size difference.
Jenny: How can we possibly suspend our disbelief enough to take hold of his assertion that, "That jacket looks better on you, Buffy"?
Kristin: You know what? If it means that hunky Angel is giving his jacket to Buffy, I will suspend all of my disbelief.
Jenny: And now walking around in a tank top.
Kristin: Yeah! Win-win! It’s a great thing.
Jenny: Oh my god. Giles, following our introduction to Fork Guy, and also watching how incredibly scared he is of Ms. French, which is so great, we have two great things from Giles. And they are... whew! First of all, we see him with a mug, but it’s not his green home mug–
Kristin: Yes.
Jenny: It’s his work mug, so don’t get confused if last episode, you decided to be my comrade in the field, hunting down a green mug. That’s not–
Kristin: No.
Jenny: We didn’t see the mug in question in this episode.
Kristin: You will–
Jenny: That is some shoddy work mug!
Kristin: You will not get–
Jenny: Something from the teacher’s lounge. Don’t look at that mug. Look away!
Kristin: You won’t get a song for that mug.
Jenny: No, no, no. And then [laughing] Buffy asks him if he knows Ms. French, the substitute biology teacher, and he says, "Oh yes, she’s lovely, [raises voice] in a common, extremely well-proportioned way!" Smooth, Giles.
Kristin: Very smooth, Giles. Giles is too smart, too well-read to possibly admit that he might be attracted to a lady. A lady who isn’t you know, reading a book, always.
Jenny: "I’m only interested in books and tweed."
Kristin: My next little note here is when we have Xander with Ms. French, at her house. So if you have something before that–
Jenny: Just before that, she’s like, "Would you be willing to come to my place?" And he’s like, "Uhhhh," and then it cuts to him taking the ripping guitar solo?
Kristin: Ugh, right.
Jenny: Which is pretty great. It’s pretty funny.
Kristin: That is a good moment. And, you know, actually there is an important moment to probably talk about. Well, there’s two. One, she eats a fucking sandwich with crickets.
Jenny: She eats a cricket-wich.
Kristin: Which must be your nightmare, because Jenny hates crickets.
Jenny: Well, those crickets aren’t as bad as the ones we have like, in our garage, which remind me of crickets we had in the cellar where we kept the inner tubes. Inner tubes, in case you didn’t grow up in the middle of the woods, are the inflatable tubes that go inside your tires. And if you are not the kind of person who has something else to float around on, in a river, creek, or lake, you might take an inner tube, blow it up, and go floating around in it.
Kristin: Wait! Inner tubes are tubes from inside of tires, and that’s why they’re called inner tubes ?
Jenny: Yes.
Kristin: I just thought, I thought you were so silly telling everybody what an inner tube was. ‘Cause I was like, everyone knows an inner tube is just a floating tube that goes into the pool.
Jenny: I guess I could have just left it at that, but I wanted to be specific that the ones we had were from actually inside of tires, and not like, the branded ones that you would buy at the sporting goods store.
Kristin: Wow. But how cool is that? I never even knew that’s why they were called inner tu– I didn’t know where the word "inner" came– I just suspended my disbelief. I was like, sure, they’re inner tubes, I’ll call them that. Anyway.
Jenny: So, we kept our inner tubes, real inner tubes, in this like, weird cellar compartment. And I would have to go in to get them if we were gonna go swimming, and there were enormous, mutant crickets. We called them hippity-hops, because I– well, my mom actually came up with the name. I was gonna say we called them that because we were children, but my mom dubbed them, I believe, hippity-hops. And they’re kind of like translucent and enormous and the worst. And the ones we have in the garage here are like, smaller versions of that. Those, I wouldn’t want to eat. I feel like the ones–
Kristin: [laughing] You’d wanna eat the tiny ones?
Jenny: If I had to choose between the Ms. French cricket-wich or a cricket-wich of my own making, using the crickets in our garage, I would pick her cricket-wich.
Kristin: This is good, good to know. Good to know that in the game show you just made up where you have to decide between the cricket-wich you saw and the cricket-wich you make, you will pick Ms. French’s cricket-wich. [laughter] The other thing that I didn’t write but that I remembered is that this is the moment when– I mean, it probably should have been last episode, when Buffy was like, "Xander probably has a crush on me," because, we didn’t talk about it, but–
Jenny: [yells] The bracelet!
Kristin: He gave her– last episode, he gave her a bracelet! What did it say?
Jenny: [softly] "Yours, always."
Kristin: Right, but–
Jenny: And then he said, "Uh, uh, they all said that! Erg!" But you know he went to Things Remembered and he selected the engraveable charm bracelet and was like [thoughtfully], "Yours, always."
Kristin: Wow, and there’s a relic that lives on today. Things Remembered stood the test of time.
Jenny: Things Remembered is still a thing?
Kristin: Mm-hm!
Jenny: Not just remembered?
Kristin: No, it’s still a thing, and it’s still remembered, and it is still in Crossgates Mall in Albany, New York. [laughter] But this is a moment, like this moment between Xander and Buffy, is like very, very telling for Buffy. I think it must be the first time that she’s really noticing that Xander has feelings for her, because Xander loses his whole mind! He loses his whole mind. He’s like, "Oh, you can’t stand it that I have feelings for another woman?"
Jenny: Right.
Kristin: And she’s like, "What in the h–"
Jenny: "What are you talking about?"
Kristin: "The hell is going on?" So that was an important moment. But then the next note I have is in all caps. "Your hands are really serrated." [Jenny laughs] Which was a line I really enjoyed.
Jenny: Yeah, that’s one of my favorites too. I also wrote that down. And then, I immediately wrote down after that, "Wow, that morphing effect!" I mean, I know it was 1997 and everybody was doing the best they could with the money they had, but wow! That morphing effect.
Kristin: Yeah, I mean hand to, what do you call? A mandible? What do you call a–
Jenny: Mandibles are like, by your mouth. Or your mouth if you have mandibles, not your mouth.
Kristin: The big reveal of this episode is that I, Kristin Russo, have mandibles.
Jenny: [laughs] Yes! Could we just call that a mantis paw?
Kristin: Yes, a mantis paw.
Jenny: I’m sure that’s not accurate, but I like it.
Kristin: The transformation to a mantis paw. I was in. I think that I go into this knowing that it’s ‘97, so I’m certainly, you know, I’m not watching for like, the best effects. But I swear, some of the effects in stuff that is made before effects had such high power are more intriguing to me than the high-tech stuff that we have now. Which, in twenty years, will be the low-tech stuff, but whatever.
Jenny: Right, right. I tend to prefer stuff that’s heavier on practical effects than computer generated whatnots.
Kristin: Right. But yeah, so here’s Xander. Xander’s about to have sex.
Jenny: He thinks he’s gettin’ it!
Kristin: He’s so– and what a, like, traumatic, scarring experience, you know. We really– we don’t look at things like that too often in the show, but like, think about–
Jenny: Oof, that would be so rough. What’s it gonna do to you?
Kristin: You’re– you’ve never had this moment before, you’re like, oh my gosh, I’m gonna have sex with this woman. This is a teacher, this is an older woman, like, all the things that are going through Xander’s head. And then she transforms into a fucking praying mantis before his eyes. Like, do you think it’s gonna be a minute before Xander is even attracted to any person, ever again?
Jenny: It’s gonna take some time, he’s gonna need to do some healing.
Kristin: That’s a psychological mind-bend, right there, is what that is. [laughter] But, yeah, so she’s a mantis, she brings him to the basement, where we find, that guess what–
Jenny: Blayne!
Kristin: Blayne’s there!
Jenny: What a virgin!
Kristin: What a virgin. And when I– we talked about this at the beginning of this episode, how, you know, there’s so many upendings of masculinity in this show, and what I loved about this scene too was it seemed like, the more you touted your masculinity, the bigger baby you became in the face of danger.
Jenny: Right.
Kristin: Which I love, and I’ve seen that happens in other movies and other shows. And I really enjoy it, I think, ‘cause it’s a nice underlining of how ridiculous it is that on the outside, so many people– so many men feel the need to be like, [important voice] "Ba-ha-ha" –
Jenny: To puff themselves up.
Kristin: Right! To puff themselves up. When like, really, in the face of a praying mantis, we’re all just as scared. And Blayne is the most scared. Xander’s actually–
Jenny: He’s pretty cool under fire, all things considered. Also, if you’re gonna break a bar off of your cell, why wouldn’t you break a bar off that leads out of the cell?
Kristin: Which is the question that Blayne asks, to give Blayne a point. He’s like, "Man, what?" But yeah, Xander stays really calm, considering, and like, makes a break for it. And then slams his head. That head slam made me gasp aloud.
Jenny: Yeah, that was bad.
Kristin: It was a bad bang.
Jenny: And then down the stairs.
Kristin: Down the stairs.
Jenny: Meanwhile!
Kristin: [laughs] Meanwhile, in Sunnydale–
Jenny: Back to the library with Buffy, Willow, and Giles and it’s revealed after Giles gets off the phone with the– his colleague who is now in an asylum–
Kristin: Right–
Jenny: Who chased and hunted a she-mantis for a long time and was driven mad in his pursuit, has revealed to Giles that the mantis in fact is seeking human male virgins, right?
Kristin: Mm-hm.
Jenny: And Giles repeats this to Buffy and Willow, and Buffy tries to like, wrap her mind around like, "Umm, is he probably– he’s fine, right? He must be fi–" And Willow’s like, "We gotta go right now!"
Kristin: [laughs] Willow knows what’s up.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Willow– and you know, something we see in this episode too, I think is Willow starting to make a little bit more apparent that she has some kind of feelings for Xander.
Jenny: [sweetly] She loves his head!
Kristin: She loves him very much.
Jenny: It’s where his eyes are, and his hair!
Kristin: Right? It’s very sweet. It’s very sweet, and that’s, you know. We’ll explore more. But then! Buffy goes and gets old Fork Hand to show them where to find this teacher-mantis–
Jenny: After briefly meeting with the woman whose social security number the she-mantis stole, [Kristin laughs] Buffy elects to hop down into the sewer, grab ol’ Fork Guy, and have him essentially lead her like a bloodhound through– a literal bloodhound–
Kristin: Right?
Jenny: Through the neighborhood until she finds the house that he’s scared of.
Kristin: And this is like– this is a great moment too because the whole episode starts with Angel being like, "You’re gonna have a tough time with this one."
Jenny: Ha!
Kristin: "Don’t let him get you in a corner! Here’s my jacket." And Buffy’s like, "I need this one for another project, actually." [laughter] "Let me tie him up and lead him through the streets like a puppy dog that I have on a leash." So she was fine. That guy, see you later, via fence stake.
Jenny: Right, right, right. And then they’ve got– she’s had Giles record some bat sonar because she did her homework.
Kristin: Right? ‘Cause she did her homework because the teacher believed in her!
Jenny: [yells] Awww, because Dr. Gregory!
Kristin: God! If there’s any take away message that I’m most happy about in this whole episode– well, okay, take away message number one, women can bite your head off, so fuck off. Take away message number two, is like, teachers believing in students is so powerful.
Jenny: Yeah, it’s really important.
Kristin: But yeah, so then we– right, the virgins, Blayne is a virgin, Xander is a virgin. Like, that bow is tied, that–
Jenny: Right, right, right.
Kristin: You know, puffed-up masculinity, "ha, ha, ha," it’s nothing, it’s just all a farce.
Jenny: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.
Kristin: And then, my next note in all-caps is, "Angel is so hot, Angel smiled, Angel smiled!"
Jenny: Wait, before we– just sticking to chronology for one second–
Kristin: Okay, I’ll read that again, that’s fine.
Jenny: ’Cause we’re gonna need to talk about Angel a little bit more. Once they get into the mantis lair, and Buffy’s like, "Get a load of this!" and she hits play on the tape recorder, and you hear Giles’ voice, [fancy British accent] "Extremely important to file not only alphabetically" and she’s like, "What?!" and he’s like, "Flip it over!" And then– and then once she gets the tape flipped over and hits play again, she’s like– so classic. "Bat sonar makes your whole nervous system go to hell. You can go there with it!" Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack! Such a great horror zinger, like, you know, has a real classic heft to it–
Kristin: Totally, totally! And that’s like, you know, I don’t think this is a spoiler, but we get deep into Buffy’s sarcasm– like, sarcastic remarks later in the series, ‘cause I remember that specifically–
Jenny: Oh, yeah.
Kristin: Being something that becomes so much a part of her–
Jenny: The banter.
Kristin: Right, so much a part of her repertoire that when people do impersonations of her, that’s–
Jenny: Right.
Kristin: That’s what they hold to, is this ridiculous banter. I mean, not ridiculous, amazing banter. That she can not only kill these demons but she can be like, "Ba dum bum tssh" before she slays, it’s great! So great.
Jenny: And also, one last thing before we go back to Angel town. I just wanted to note that this episode begins with Xander having a daydream about saving Buffy, and ends with Buffy saving Xander.
Kristin: And there it is.
Jenny: Just something to think about.
Kristin: Ba dum bum tssh.
Jenny: So. Angel, he’s like, "Keep the jacket, toots." And then he smiles and then he walks away, and she’s like, "Oh, boy."
Kristin: He smiles ! And I’m like, oh, boy.
Jenny: I know, me too.
Kristin: Isn’t everyone?
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Sexuality aside?
Jenny: My kingdom for a time machine and the opportunity.
Kristin: Yeah, I mean, ‘cause he has definitely not smiled. Every cell in my body knew that I had not seen him yet smile, when he smiled. We’ve only seen him be very serious and he’s, I don’t know, maybe he likes Buffy a little bit. [Jenny laughs] She’s making him smile, he’s giving her his jacket. What I want to know is, can we time travel back so that I can be like, "Hey Buffy, now that you have Angel’s jacket, can I borrow your brown leather jacket that you wore a few episodes ago?"
Jenny: Right? I need to get some screen grabs– we need to screen grab that jacket, post it on socials, "Have you seen this jacket?"
Kristin: "Have you–" [laughs] We should put up signs in the neighborhood.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah. "Missing!"
Kristin: You know, a thing that I also thought was really funny as the episode was winding down, you know, Buffy’s like, "Oh," what does she say? "Oh, boy"?
Jenny: "Oh, boy."
Kristin: "Oh, boy." Was that– ‘cause then, oh, then she goes, I don’t know what the order is, but she gets his– the teacher’s glasses–
Jenny: Right, that’s the very last thing.
Kristin: The very last scene, and she puts it in his like, jacket pocket–
Jenny: Aww!
Kristin: Which is behind the door, and that was my first emotion, "Aww!" I’m so moved, and like, the teacher really meant so much to her, and then I thought, why have no police been involved in this investigation? [laughter] Why is his jacket and his glasses still in a classroom that is open to students, when he has been beheaded inside of the school and put into a refrigerator?
Jenny: Well, I think either the police in Sunnydale are so busy that they can’t possibly get to every beheading–
Kristin: Right. [laughs]
Jenny: Or they’re so used to totally bonkers shit happening all the time, they’re like, "Well, unless you need us to stop an active criminal from doing something in front of you right now, we’ll be doing that elsewhere."
Kristin: God, I guess that’s true, ‘cause the first episode, there was that dead guy in the locker, and no police were–
Jenny: The extreme dead guy in the locker.
Kristin: The extreme dead guy in the locker! We saw no police intervention then, either.
Jenny: We don’t see a whole lot of police in Sunnydale.
Kristin: So, interesting, interesting to me that all the evidence from this man’s murder was just open, free-range for anyone to play with or touch.
Jenny: Right, yikes.
Kristin: Or have their feelings about their teachers on.
Jenny: But thank god that was possible so Buffy could get a little closure and say, "Good night, Dr. Gregory," and then we could see the eggs !
Kristin: Yeah, I’m curious to see if Buffy does her homework more now in future episodes, or if it was just a one-episode arc. [laughs]
Jenny: [laughs] We shall see.
Kristin: Yeah, we shall see.
Jenny: I’ve got a question for you!
Kristin: Mm?
Jenny: Did you ever have a crush on any of your teachers?
Kristin: Oooh. Good question! I don’t– I think that I might have had like, a crush on my first-grade teacher without knowing that it was a crush? Because I like, so vividly remember her. Her name was Mrs. Wells, and I don’t know what she actually looked like, but my memory of her is like– she was very young, I’m sure, like in her twenties or something. And she had long, blonde hair, and I just remember, like, loving her so much. So that, like, that’s my most visceral teacher-love memory? But it was so– it was before the time when I could obviously identify it as any kind of actual crush. And that’s the biggest thing I remember, in terms of– yeah.
Jenny: Wow.
Kristin: What about you?
Jenny: I had like, crushes on a couple of teachers in high school, but like, I don’t wanna say their names in case, like, they are Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans? And podcast enthusiasts?
Kristin: What? Why? This would be a great reveal for them! [chanting] Say the names! Say the names!
Jenny: Okay, okay, okay, I’m not gonna say their names, but I’ll like... be more descriptive. There was like, an art teacher who was, like, the super hot young art teacher that everybody had a crush on, and there was an English teacher who was like, really smart and cool.
Kristin: And we can’t know their names?
Jenny: No.
Kristin: Great. Well, I’ll do some research, audience. [Jenny laughs] I’ll see if I can find their names for us.
Jenny: Perfect.
Kristin: You don’t want your teachers to know you had a crush on them?
Jenny: No! Heavens no, that would be so humiliating-slash-probably they already know.
Kristin: Mrs. Wells from Our Lady of Lourdes in West Islip, New York, if you’re out there, I would like for you to know that first-grade Kristin thought you were pretty rad.
Jenny: Wow. You’re really somethin’.
Kristin: Thanks.
Jenny: I feel like we really did a number on this episode.
Kristin: I know, I’m actually happy that I got through the notes that I had, because when I finished this episode, I was like, oh, I have so much to say–
Jenny: We might not– this might be a two-hour episode.
Kristin: Yeah, this might be–
Jenny: A very special episode of Buffering the Vampire Slayer , this is our holiday special!
Kristin: Yeah, "Teacher’s Pet" really got me! A lot happened in it, I was excited– things that happen in this episode that didn’t happen last episode that I think, you know, like, Angel was here, The Bronze was here, like, there were just things that personally get Kristin fired up–
Jenny: Yeah, yeah.
Kristin: In this episode, so I had more to say specifically about things.
Jenny: More Buffy and Willow being willfully silent feminists.
Kristin: Yes! Yes, exactly, less Cordelia, which you know–
Jenny: Is a bummer, but.
Kristin: Is a bummer, but her presence was noted and loved.
Jenny: And felt .
Kristin: And felt.
Jenny: And more– I just feel like, like a little more depth from everybody.
Kristin: Yes.
Jenny: Just a little partial layer carved out.
Kristin: We’re getting there!
Jenny: Yeah, it’s so awesome.
Kristin: Ahhh! I’m so excited, it’s like, all I want to do– I want you all to know that all– and stay with me, and us, if you’re watching this for the first time, or rewatching it, because all I want to do is be like, okay, Jenny, but can we just watch the whole– can we just watch a bunch of episodes? So that we can see all of these amazing things that I know are coming along, but I’m gonna be patient.
Jenny: You’re gonna pace yourself.
Kristin: I’m gonna pace myself for this podcast. So listeners, pace yourselves too, so you can watch along with us, ‘cause I think it’s the most fun way.
Jenny: This podcast thanks you.
Kristin: [laughs] Cool! Well, "Teacher’s Pet".
Jenny: We did it.
Kristin: We did it!
Jenny: What a great episode!
Kristin: And you know, we might– according to the end of this episode, we may have to do it again, because those eggs were lookin’ mighty hatched.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, they were really feeling mature.
Kristin: They were ready to go! And that is a classic horror ending too!
Jenny: Totally, very Wes Craven.
Kristin: Yes, it’s like–
Jenny: "To be continued... possibly."
Kristin: The bow is tied! Just kidding! Just kidding, ‘cause the monster is still out there. [Jenny laughs] Yeah, A-plus-plus for this episode. One of my favorites so far. Out of four.
Jenny: Super great. I guess that’s it for this week. Thanks so much for joining us. We’ll be back next week with "Never Kill a Boy on the First Date." My name’s Jenny Owen Youngs, and you can find me on Twitter @jennyowenyoungs.
Kristin: And I’m Kristin Russo, and you can find me on Twitter @kristinnoeline, which is K-R-I-S-T-I-N-N-O-E-L-I-N-E. We’re all gonna get there together. One day we’ll all know how to spell my name. Or you can just follow me @everyoneisgay.
Jenny: And if you’d like to find us on Twitter as a podcast, you can tweet at us @bufferingcast, or you can write us an email at bufferingthevampireslayer@gmail.com.
Kristin: We are going to read some of the messages that we’ve gotten from you and talk about some of the questions you’ve asked us on some special episodes this season and next season and seasons into the future called mailbag episodes, Jenny said, right? That’s what they’re called in podcast-land?
Jenny: Yes, mailbag episodes, that’s what professional podcasters call them.
Kristin: Jenny’s teaching me how to be a professional podcaster. [laughter] So stay tuned for those.
Jenny: Yeah, and we’ve been loving the emails we’ve been getting so far, it’s been so delightful to receive them.
Kristin: Yeah, and speaking of delightful things to receive and lovely notes, if you haven’t yet gone to iTunes and left us a review, please do. We would love to hear from you, especially if you have a positive opinion. [laughter] But you know, those reviews are super helpful. It helps people say like, "Oh, is this for real?" And then they see your wonderful, lovely reviews, and they’re like, "This is for real, because Anonymous loved it." So, yeah, head on over there and help us out, and we’ll see you– well, we won’t see you.
Jenny: But we’ll talk to you next week.
Kristin: Yes.
