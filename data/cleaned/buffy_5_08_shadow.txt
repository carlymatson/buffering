Buffering the Vampire Slayer
Episode 5.08: Shadow
Jenny: Hey! Happy New Year!
Kristin: Oh my gosh! Happy New Year. Jenny, will you do me a favor and will you ask me who I am?
Jenny: Who… are you?
Kristin: I am Barbara Walters and this is 2020!
Jenny: Wow…
Kristin: [laughs] That was for the seven and a half—
Jenny: I should… get going.
Kristin: I've been waiting. I've been waiting all this time to make that joke.
Jenny: [laughs] Wow! I'm so happy that you finally got what you have desired for so long. Um, I've just been saying, I'm 2020 Jenny.
Kristin: 2020 Jenny? Yeah, that sounds nice.
Jenny: Yeah, that's right.
Kristin: It doesn't really work for "Kristin" so I had to go with a dad joke, you know?
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, a bad one—sure, sure, sure, sure. [laughter]
Kristin: Either you get it or you don't and if you do, then you're old, and if you don't, then congratulations.
Jenny: Ha!
Kristin: [laughs] Okay, so we have a couple of things before we head on into Shadow. I just heard earlier today the song that Jenny is working, and you should get excited for that at the end of the episode, 'cause it's…
Jenny: Yeah!
Kristin: It's a dancin' hit, I think.
Jenny: Nothing but the highest quality, you know—I deal in nuance and I deal in subtlety. And metaphor. I wonder what this song will be like.
Kristin: I wonder. I want to let everyone know that I found out—I discovered a couple of months ago that our Patron supporters—our supporters on Patreon—they do a million things. And one of them is that they have a pen pal exchange. And I flipped out when I found out and was like, "why am I not invited to the penpal exchange?" To which I became invited. Michaela is the person who's running the penpal exchange over there, and so I'm telling you all, in case you, like me, did not know, that the signups are open now. The next round of signups, if you want a penpal, for our patrons, from today, January 8th until January 22nd. It's really cute, you just fill out a form. You say if you wanna stay within the US or if you're willing to send your letters internationally and then you—there's even, like—Jenny, there's even a little place where you say like, "I've seen the whole series, you can spoil me" or like, "I haven't seen it yet, you can't."
Jenny: [laughs] Oh no!
Kristin: It's really, really cute. And we'll put up the form on Patreon and on the secret Facebook group from Michaela. And Michaela, thank you for spearheading that. It's really, really great, and I'm doing it. I don't know if you're gonna do it, Jenny, but I'm gonna definitely sign up for it and have a penpal in there.
Jenny: Wow. Speaking of incredibly important messages, have I got one for you! It's the Sexual Tension Award results from last episode. Are you ready?
Kristin: [laughs] I'm ready.
Jenny: With a deeply disappointing 5% of the vote, in fourth place… we have the rightful heirs to the crown, but alas, it shall not be.
Kristin: No. Ehh!
Jenny: Xander and Riley's butt.
Kristin: I mean, it was hilarious. Also, the fact that my notes have "Riley's butt, 5%" is a real—it's just really funny to me, to look at.
Jenny: [laughs] In second place—well, there's just some stiff competition, no pun intended, in this episode. In sec—in third place. In third place...we have, with 23% of the vote, Spike and Angel. Working our way through the chain of Spike nominations. We have, in second place with 29% of the vote, Spike and Dru.
Kristin: Isn't that incredible? Spike sucked blood off of Drusilla's—I mean. Drusilla sucked blood off of Spike's finger and still only managed to garner 29%.
Jenny: Shocking.
Kristin: Tough episode.
Jenny: But the people want what the people want, and here, in first place with 43% of the vote, it's Spike and Buffy. You're welcome.
Kristin: I mean, of course, it had to be. It's Fool for Love.
Jenny: Yes.
Kristin: We would have been absolutely scandalized had they not won this vote-off. So congratulations, Spike, Buffy. Your trophy is in the mail. Jenny.
Jenny: Yo.
Kristin: Are you ready for the first Spooky News of 2020?
Jenny: This better be good. You better start the decade correctly.
NOTES: [SPOOKY NEWS jingle plays] Spooky news!
Kristin: Okay, Jenny. Well, Lindsay S. sent in a story that is mildly spooky and very relevant to today's episode.
Jenny: Ooh!
Kristin: It's a story that comes from Boston's local NPR affiliate. And the title of the
story is: Baby Anacondas Born at a New England Aquarium Without Any Male Snakes Involved.
Jenny: Hell… yeah! Life finds a way! [inaudible]
Kristin: [laughs] Yeah. So this is very unexpected. It's only happened—this is only the second time that it's been recorded that something like this has happened. It happens more with plants and invertebrates. Invertebrates? Invertebraes?
Jenny: I believe it's "brates."
Kristin: So like, wasps and ants, you see this thing which is called parthenogenesis. And parthenogenesis can be done in one of two ways. One, you—the entity, animal, thing creates itself as a clone. And in the other one—
Jenny: Ooh!
Kristin: It sort of rearranges some shit and then you don't get a full clone, but it doesn't need anything else. So this anaconda, two of the snake babies survived, out of like, 18 snake babies. And they are—they were tested, they are exact clones of the mom.
Jenny: Whoa.
Kristin: So okay—so unlike most snake species, anacondas don't lay eggs. So when they walked into this aquarium, they saw this snake literally giving birth to little snakes. Like, it literal—it wasn't dropping eggs, it was little baby—18 baby snakes came out of this anaconda. So I thought today, on the first day—the first episode of 2020 here at Buffering and an episode where we get yet another snake demon lizard monster, if you will, we could hear some Spooky News that's actually not so spooky. Because fuck yeah, lady snake!
Jenny: Ha! Wow.
NOTES: [SPOOKY NEWS jingle plays] Spooky news!
Jenny: Well, it's officially 2020, as we've already mentioned. But that means it's currently the year of 2020 Prom, which has not yet happened, which still waits for us upon the golden horizon. Our live taping of I Was Made to Love You is sold out, but there are still some Prom bids left. You can find them at bufferingthevampireslayer.com, just click on Events and you can find all the relevant info there. Please join us for our most formal occasion of the year.
Kristin: Yes, please do. So excited. We already have some costumes in the works for this Prom. We are—
Jenny: We do?!
Kristin: Yes, we do! Well, I'll remind you after we stop taping, Jenny.
Jenny: Okay.
Kristin: [laughs] Other things I would like to remind all of you of are that we have two Patreon events coming up. January 11, which is this weekend, we'll be watching Scream 2 together. All of the details for that can be found on our Patreon page and also on our Facebook page, the secret Facebook page, of course. And on the 22nd of February, Jenny will be playing you all of your favorite Buffering songs. Jenny, I hope that you learn this song for this episode for the next—
Jenny: Oh, hell yeah.
Kristin: Buffering concert because I think it's gonna be a real jam to hear live as well. [laughter]
Jenny: Excellent.
Kristin: And of course, you can find out more and join our Patreon family over at bufferingthevampireslayer.com, just click on Patreon. One other thing before we roll over into this episode. Holy shit, Jenny. What the fuck happened a couple of days ago? We must make sure that everyone knows.
Jenny: Oh! Um, okay, let's see. You're asking me a question and I need some time to think of the answer to that question…
Kristin: [laughs] Oh, oh, I can give you some—
Jenny: Is there some music you could play that might help me think of the answer?
Kristin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, let me give you some—yeah, yeah, here you go.
NOTES: [Jeopardy timer music starts playing]
Jenny: [talking over music] Wow! Did you see that we were on frickin' Jeopardy?! We were an answer on frickin' Jeopardy?! Ahhh-ha-ha!
Kristin: [talking over music] We were the $200… clue? How do you talk about it? The $200—
Jenny: We were the $200 answer. Uh, right?
Kristin: The $200 answer, yes. [music stops] The $200 answer in the podcast category. The answer was "completes the title of a podcast devoted to a Sarah Michelle Gellar series, Buffering…" And our friend—just kidding, we don't know Karen, but this—
Jenny: A whole other Karen.
Kristin: Yeah, this whole other Karen—this lady named Karen who was on Jeopardy, was like, "bleep-bloop! The Vampire Slayer?" And Jenny and I have never been so excited in our entire lives. I mean, I literally was like, just pacing around my house in excitement for, like, three hours.
Jenny: You know, I've been… running around the house all weekend now, humming to myself Jeopardy. The song—not the [hums a little] song but the song by the Greg Kihn Band. That was brought into my consciousness because Weird Al Yankovic parodied it. But basically, the chorus of the original is, [sings] "I was in jeopardy, baby. Oooh-ooh-ooh!"
Kristin: 'Cause we were in jeopardy. [singing] "We were in jeopardy—"
Both: [singing] "Baby! Oooh-ooh-ooh!"
Jenny: Great. They're gonna love it!
Kristin: [laughs] Wow. So now that we've let you know that we have officially peaked. The mountain does not go any higher than this.
Jenny: Yeah, it's all over. How sad.
Kristin: We will roll—[laughs] yeah, it's done, it's done. Thank you for listening. It's been lovely. We're gonna roll you right over into the theme song and another episode of our podcast, a podcast featured on the very popular, totally—we're immortalized. That's it.
Jenny: I feel very powerful.
Kristin: Me. Too.
Jenny: You know, I sent my dad a Jeopardy question-a-day calendar for Christmas. [Kristin gasps twice] And I wonder if one day, later, we'll be anthologized in a Jeopardy question-a-day calendar.
Kristin: Oh my god. You should—Jenny, you should make your dad a calendar next year that's just—
Jenny: Ha!
Kristin: Every day is—
Jenny: Every day is that one.
Kristin: Yeah, is us. [laughs]
Jenny: Beautiful, love it, thank you.
Kristin: Alright, let's get into the episode.
Jenny: Indeed.
NOTES: [Buffering theme plays]
Jenny: Hello. And welcome to Buffering the Vampire Slayer, a podcast where we are watching and discussing every episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, one by one, spoiler-free. I'm Jenny Owen Youngs!
Kristin: And I am Kristin Russo. This week, we are back. Happy 2020. We are here to talk to you about Buffy Season 5, Episode 8, Shadow. Stay tuned at the end of this podcast every other week for an original song, written by Jenny. Jenny, it's about a snake this week, isn't it?
Jenny: It's about a great big snake.
Kristin: Can't wait to hear it. Uh, recapping the Buffy episode we are discussing. And also, if you are looking for something to do in 2020 and have not yet started listening to our sister podcast, Angel on Top, hosted by Brittany Ashley and Laura Zak, you should be doing that. It is fantastic and it goes in tandem with our watch, so they are going to be back next week with Season 2, Episode 8 of Angel. Get on it!
Jenny: Bing. Bong!
Kristin: Yes.
Jenny: As I always say.
Kristin: As you do always say. [laughs]
Jenny: Well, Shadow was written by David Fury and directed by Dan Attias. And originally aired—buckle up! It originally aired on November 21st , 2000. My last day of being 18.
Kristin: [laughs] Buffy is, in fact, all in relation to what age you were and how far away you were from celebrating your next birthday.
Jenny: It was all very carefully planned.
Kristin: This is the one where, according to IMDB, Glory transforms a snake into a terrifying monster in her quest to find the Key. Just a side note, I think that's debatable, the terrifying aspect, but we'll get into that. [laughter] And Joyce is hospitalized after being diagnosed with an illness. This is the one where there's a great big snake.
Jenny: There's a great big snake! It's got some flashing red eyes, but I guess we can wait to get to that.
Kristin: This is like the era of, "we have just discovered CGI." Not just discovered it, but just—maybe it got cheap enough to use more frequently, perhaps? But it is just—so I just watched, Jenny—I know you know this and most of the people who are listening know this because I had a long Twitter party about this. But I just watched all the Star Wars.
Jenny: Yes!
Kristin: All of them, all nine. I watched them in a week. And I went from the ones made in the 80s to the ones made in the early aughts, to the ones then made currently. And the CGI journey that you have is, like—where they were in the Natalie Portman years of the Star Wars trilogies is where we are now in Buffy. And you can totally see the parallels, of just like, you wanna just put your head in the sand and be like, why have you done this? [laughs]
Jenny: Woof!
Kristin: It was so much better when you were sculpting things from whatever you could find in the prop room. Because this—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: And I think there are some really nice practical effects, like the—coming from the side eyelids, the translucent eyelids that we see, which are a practical effect, look really—I think they look—[laughing] considering what they're mounted on, I think they look pretty good.
Kristin: Sure. Well, and that's the thing 'cause—
Jenny: But then, what's worse—Kristin, what's worse? A nightmarishly bad CGI snake man, whipping through town from a bird's eye view, or a huge, thick, really dead-looking practical snake tail that's being filmed close up, just dragging across the floor of a church?
Kristin: [laughs] I actually very cleanly vote that the CGI is worse. [Jenny laughs] That's what I was gonna say, that like—'cause we get both. There is a real snake. I sent Jenny a really fantastic photo right before we started taping that I found. I was looking for a GIF of Buffy riding the snake—which I will make, never you fear. Myself, I did not find one. I found this picture of the snake man in a—goofing around, I guess, on set with a towel wrapped around his waist, holding a roll of toilet paper. So you know, there was a real monster snake and then the CGI. And they're both a little rough, but I wish that we had had a goofy snake tail dragging across the floor much more than I wanted any of that horrible CGI.
Jenny: Yeah… [laughter]
Kristin: Anyway! Let's get into the episode. Apparently, we're starting off—I mean, hey, what better way to start a new year than by an in-depth discussion of a demon lizard? You know what I mean?
Jenny: Yeah, I think we're actually overdue.
Kristin: We are. It's been a minute. [laughs] We should—let's do a vote-off, actually. I think we should do a vote-off of your favorite demon lizard to date, and we'll do the frat lizard, the mayor snake, and the cobra snake. Right? We'll see where everybody lands.
Jenny: Nice. Well, yeah, they love snakes on this show, huh?
Kristin: They fucking love a snake. [laughs] Okay, so the Previously On sets us up for all of the things. And it's kind of an extensive Previously On because we took a pretty hard turn with Fool for Love, right? Like, we went down a very particular path and they're like, "okay, okay, everybody, regroup." [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: "Remember, we've got Glory—" who gets named in this episode. We finally can call her all of her supremely magnificent names. And we get that Dawn is the Key, we get that Joyce is sick, we get that Riley is feeling left out, we get that Spike is in love with Buffy. So we're set up to remember, okay, let's reorient, here we go.
Jenny: Yeah. And unpopular opinion of mine, wow, I hate hospitals and medical scanning machines. Why do we have to pick up here? I know why we have to pick up here, but…
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: [sighs] This just automatically cranks my viewing stress level up.
Kristin: Yeah. So Joyce is sort of being put into the CAT scan machine. And it's really—I mean, it is upsetting but it's also really beautiful, the way they shot it, I think. Like, the light on her face and—it's very haunting. Even if you are not as upset at hospitals as Jenny is, like, it is very haunting, the way that they set up this opening scene. So she's going in to get a CAT scan and Dawn and Buffy are in the waiting room. And Dawn is very adorably, like, "so what about cats—where are the cats?" [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. "Show me the cats."
Kristin: "Show me those cats in CAT scan."
Jenny: Now if they had cats at a hospital, I'd probably like them a lot more.
Kristin: I mean, honestly, that CAT scan machine would be a lot better if there were a couple of cats just hanging around, you know.
Jenny: Or just a couple—like, a pair of cat ears on top of the machine.
Kristin: Oh, cute. Yeah, that'd be cute. But Buffy—and this is a big episode for Buffy and Dawn. It's—I mean, for a lot of reasons, but we see it start here, where Dawn says some—this thing about the cats. And Buffy goes to get annoyed and then has the space to realize, "my little sister is terrified and I need to be here for her." So she holds her—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: And then we go to the Magic Box where—I mean, very pivotal part of this episode, Jenny, hinges on the Yellow Pages, which really—
Jenny: Now kids. [Kristin laughs] The Yellow Pages were, like… a corporeal Google but only for businesses within a certain range.
Kristin: [laughs] Yes, your local—
Jenny: You could only get information about local businesses and also—
Kristin: And people!
Jenny: The home—the landlines of people around you.
Kristin: I mean, it was like—I don't know how kids today prank call. But it was the main source for the fun of prank calling people, was the Yellow Pages. You would just—
Jenny: Would you—sorry, would you prank call people you knew or people you didn't know?
Kristin: No! People I didn't know. We would just open the phone book and find a phone number and then call somebody.
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kristin: I don't even remember what we would say, but you know, we would laugh and have a great time. I actually—I'm watching Six Feet Under for the first time and I just watched an episode—'cause you know, every one starts with a death. And I just watched an episode that starts with three girls doing exactly that. They're prank calling, and the one laughs so hard that she falls off the bed and snaps her neck and dies. So! Anyway!
Jenny: Oh my fucking god.
Kristin: So kids, be careful with your prank calls. [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah…
Kristin: So the Yellow Pages were the businesses and the White Pages were the people? Or the reverse?
Jenny: I believe that's correct, yes.
Kristin: That's correct? Okay. They put a beautiful ad, just beautiful ad. I actually disagree with Tara's assessment that the font is too small. I think you can read everything perfectly, it's a good size—
Jenny: No, no. I think she was saying "Your one stop spot to shop for all your occult needs" was hard to read.
Kristin: Oh, just 'cause it's a wordy—[laughing] a very wordy sentence?
Jenny: Yeah, 'cause it's a little bit of a tongue—it's a minor tongue twister.
Kristin: Did you take a look at this ad, Jenny? It's pretty wonderful in a lot of ways.
Jenny: Tell me all about it.
Kristin: Well, I mean, so you have the slogan, right? And then you have these little starbursts of like, "this thing! And that thing!" typical of many an ad. And there's four starbursts, and one is like, "Potions!" And one is like, "Crystals!" And then one is like, "Death charms!" [laughter] And then the fourth one says "Lollipops for kids." [laughing] So…
Jenny: What the hell?
Kristin: And it's right next to "death charms." It's really special.
Jenny: Sure, sure.
Kristin: And I did a little bit more investigation, because there's a phone number on it. And shout out to our Santa Barbara folks who have been making the claim for quite some time that this is based as Santa Barbara, that Sunnydale is Santa Barbara. The area code is 805, which is a Santa Barbara area code, everybody.
Jenny: Well, well, well, well, well.
Kristin: Detective Kristin, on the fucking case, everyone.
Jenny: [laughs] Yeah. And—and—and! And, and also in this scene, we're getting so many great things. We're getting Anya asking if she's been mentioned in the ad. [Kristin laughs] She's very excited that there's an ad in the Yellow Pages and expects that, of course, she would be mentioned. And then—
Kristin: Oh my god, is Anya—does Anya have a touch of Gaby Dunn? Is that what I'm putting together? She's like, "love to be mentioned." [laughs]
Jenny: She loves being mentioned. And the Scoobies are communicating to Giles that, when they made a plan with Riley to go weed out that vampire nest together, Riley in fact went off by his lonesome.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: And blew up the tomb and—
Kristin: Tomb went boom.
Jenny: Tomb went boom, and you know, he's like, putting himself at risk. And Xander's concerned.
Kristin: Xander is concerned. And I wanna give another shout out to Anya, because not only does she look for herself in the ad, but then she has this moment where she's like—you know, "This is the first time I've not wanted to slaughter in the morning. I'm really growing." Like, she's really clocking her personal growth from vengeance demon to human form. [Jenny laughs] And then everybody is like, "hey guys, remember Glory? Oh yeah!" [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah, right, right, right. Also, a little bit of set color. I don't know if you've noticed some of the signage around the Magic Box cash register?
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: But there's a sign that says "Shoplifters will be transfigured."
Kristin: Mm-hmm.
Jenny: And there's also a little sign that says "Magic happens."
Kristin: If you work in a—what does it say?
Jenny: "Magic happens."
Kristin: Oh. [laughs] I thought you said "magic cabins."
Jenny: I can't tell if it's supposed to be—no, no. I can't tell if it's supposed to be like "shit happens." Or if it's supposed to be like… "magic happens and there's nothing you can do about it, person who doesn't like magic, so shut up."
Kristin: [laughs] Like, they put it up after Tara's family left?
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, exactly. [laughter]
Kristin: Yeah, if you work in a shop, I really hope that you have taken it upon yourself to put up the "shoplifters will be transfigured" sign. Because it seems like the best thing that you could ever—give a nod to Buffy.
Jenny: Yeah, I mean, it's a threat that seems more terrifying than being prosecuted. [Kristin laughs] Because at least with prosecution, you have a shot, but with transfiguration…
Kristin: I mean, 'cause Amy's still a fucking rat, as far as we know. We haven't seen her, but like… transmogrification—
Jenny: But one assumes.
Kristin: Transmogrification can be, you know, many seasons long. [laughter] Okay, so—
Jenny: So they're speculating about this woman and like, man, she's probably hanging out somewhere where bad guys usually hang out. Maybe a sewer or something and hard cut to what I guess is supposed to be a very luxurious hotel room. There is a round bed, and I have so many questions.
Kristin: Mm.
Jenny: Where do you get sheets for a round bed?
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Maybe I just have the one question. And how do you make that—that seems like—you know how it's easier to make a rectangular bed with somebody on each side?
Kristin: Yeah. Well, yeah, because even if you got a custom-made fitted sheet for your round bed, your blanket—even if your top sheet was round, tucking it in would be a living nightmare. You'd have to kind of go all the way around, tucking a little bit as you went, each—you know, each little—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: I don't want a round bed, is what I've learned, just now.
Jenny: Yeah. No thanks, Casper. Keep your round mattress that you've been piloting.
Kristin: [laughs] So yeah, Glory is living it the fuck up. I guess that we are to believe that her salary is incredibly high for the work that she's doing.
Jenny: I like that you just assume she's on salary. [laughter]
Kristin: Yeah, she's not freelancing this shit! She's getting a weekly salary.
Jenny: Okay, sure, sure.
Kristin: And she's spending it all. She—this is also—
Jenny: On shoes!
Kristin: On shoes, yeah. So she's wearing phenomenal pajamas. She's wearing—listen, let's be real. This whole—Glory is just decked out in the most beautiful fucking shit all the time. She's wearing gorgeous pajamas right now that are, like, leather—or sorry, I got ahead of myself. Velvet pants and this beautiful shirt. She's got four thousand boxes of shoes on the bed that she's trying on. Later, we'll see her in a red leather dress. Jenny, something else that we get in this scene, and we don't really spoil too much in this show, but I will say that these nicknames, if this is your first viewing, of Glory are going to continue and they will simply just get better. I wrote down a few of the names that Dreg, who we meet for the first
time—one of Glory's minions, I guess, is what we'll call this guy—calls her: "most beauteous and supremely magnificent one," "most tingly and wonderful Glorificus," which I believe is her full name. "Shiny, special one." "Your terrifically smooth one," and your "creamy coolness," all in this one scene. We get all five of those names.
NOTES: [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah. Working overtime.
Kristin: Yeah. And then, of course, Glory sees, in her copy of the Yellow Pages—
NOTES: [laughs]
Jenny: Oh my god. It's already open to that page. And man, what a well-timed reprinting of the latest edition of the Sunnydale phone book. [Kristin laughs] Can you even believe… the synchronicity at work here?
Kristin: I mean, you know, Yellow Pages, not to be underestimated. Very powerful tools in the early aughts and the late '90s. [laughs] So—
Jenny: Remember how you would just get a huge brick of one dropped on your doorstep, like…
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Probably every quarter?
Kristin: I read up on Yellow Pages and I found out that in their prime, they would use 600,000 tons of paper annually. So.
Jenny: Jesus!
Kristin: And the first phone book came out in 1878, in New Haven, Connecticut, which I thought was fun.
Jenny: Wow!
Kristin: Yeah. So there's your phone book facts, what everybody wanted from this episode. [laughs] So, okay, so Glory rips the ad out of the Yellow Pages so that she can find the Magic Box. And we cut to Buffy's house. And Riley is walking in and he's like, oh no, the door is unlocked. And he opens the door and he's like, footprints? Oh no. And Jenny, we—
Jenny: [laughs] Footprints!
Kristin: We have a—[laughs] yeah, I just imagine Spike had some muddy feet when he walked in.
Jenny: Sure, sure.
Kristin: We have a jingle that we never get to use, so let's play it for Riley.
NOTES: [Detective Riley jingle plays] Detective Riley!
Kristin: Beautiful! Detective Riley, on the fucking case. We cut to Spike, who is upstairs. And what is he doing, Jenny?
Jenny: He is having a good long euphoric sniff of a fuzzy pink sweater that belongs to none other than Buffy the Vampire Slayer—[Kristin laughs] but lo! He is caught. And he quickly whips the sweater behind his back as though he were up to nothing. And Riley's like, "What are you doing here?" And Spike is like, "Me? What are you doing here?" And Riley is very appropriately like, "Looking for the girl who's gonna rip your arms off when she finds out you were in her bedroom."
Kristin: Mm-hmm.
Jenny: I'd like to take this opportunity to wave the white flag of peace, and alert people that Riley didn't say, " I'm gonna kick your ass." He said, "my very strong, very hot girlfriend is gonna rip your arms off."
Kristin: Okay, yeah. That's a good point. We are post—you haven't heard it yet, but you're about—you're gonna hear it in a few weeks, our interview with Marc Blucas. And you'll notice, as of this episode, that although I will still keep pushing Riley to the edge of my tolerance level here, I was weakened. I was weakened in my knees.
Jenny: Mmm!
Kristin: Marc Blucas— [laughs] is just really beautiful and dreamy and so sweet. And so I think it's gonna affect the amount of anti-Rileyness that I'm able to conjure for you all. But it's—you know. I'm gonna do my best to be the Kristin that you know and love. I will try my best not to succumb to too much of…
NOTES: [THE PATRIARCHY jingle plays] The patriarchy! [thunder clap, evil laughter]
Kristin: But Riley has—I mean, Riley has some really awful moments in this episode. But for the most part, he has a really good episode, until we get to the end. And I think that, yeah. We'll give him credit here. I think there's other places later where we'll give him way more credit even then he'll get here.
Jenny: And continuing down the Detective Riley vein, he's like, "Were you just… smelling that sweater?" And Spike's like, "no, no, no, no, bro, you got it all wrong." And then Riley puts his hands very compellingly on his hips. [Kristin laughs] And Spike is like, "I cannot deny it any longer! The power of your hands on your hips is too much for me." And then says— [laughs] he takes a great big whiff and he's like, "I'm a predator, she's my prey, it's totally natural." And then says, "Slayer musk is bitter and aggravating." [laughter]
Kristin: It's good, it's good. It's a good scene. And so, we've talked a little bit about Spike and his crush—"crush," if you even can call it that, it's deeper than that, I think—on Buffy, his obsession with Buffy. And how sometimes those of us who have crushes on people can misinterpret things, can take things that are not intended as a return of affection and make them that. And Spike and Riley go downstairs 'cause Spike's gonna leave, and Spike is making, I think, some decent points to Riley. Like, "well, okay, she had drinks with me last night." That, I don't— we know that, you know, they had drinks because—
Jenny: That was an information-gathering mission.
Kristin: Right, exactly. But then he makes the very good point, which we have made several times this season and last season, which is, you know, she's done a lot of spells—a lot of whatever they do to make vampires not able—to take away their invitation so they can't come back in. And they've never taken Spike off the list. And I feel like he has a solid point here. Not that Buffy is desiring him, but certainly that, like, why? Why?
Jenny: Yeah. That is—it is peculiar.
Kristin: Mm-hmm. So—
Jenny: Um, Kristin.
Kristin: Yeah?
Jenny: You just flew past a very important thing.
Kristin: No, please, please. Go for it. [laughs]
Jenny: Back when our two favorite dudes were still upstairs, and Riley was in the process of dragging Spike out of Buffy's room so he could scoot him down to the first floor. Spike flailed and grabbed, successfully, a pair of frilly underthings that were hanging out of a drawer on his way out. Just a little something to take the edge off.
Kristin: I think they might have been hanging—was it a drawer or a hamper? I try to block it out 'cause I don't—
Jenny: No, no, it was a nightstand, I think.
Kristin: Okay, so. Clean pair of Slayer undies—
Jenny: Clean. Thank god.
Kristin: Stolen from her room. Which, Spike… no thank you. So yeah, then downstairs, speaking of piercing glances. [laughing] 'Cause you mentioned how Riley put his hands on his hips upstairs, Spike's like, "you know, at least I still—we might both be weaker than Buffy in strength and, you know, killing capacity. But I still have the attitude." [laughter] Something Spike deeply prides himself on.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kristin: "And what do you have, a piercing glance?"
Jenny: Well… he also has the ability to hold Spike in the sunlight and be like, [gruff voice] "oh, am I dark enough for you now?"
Kristin: [laughing] Yeah. Spike is very good at press—one of Spike's main roles as a character is to sort of press the buttons of other characters. To make their insecurities bloom and—
Jenny: Well, this is like the other side of the coin of his heightened, like, you know—of having the highest emotional IQ on the show. He's able to see things in a broader way, like when everybody else is sort of lost in their own bullshit, he can kind of see the bigger picture of like, how everyone's inter-connectivity is functioning.
Kristin: Right.
Jenny: And he can use that for good, by highlighting things for people and helping them get to realizations faster. Or he can know exactly which buttons to press and when and how hard.
Kristin: Right. And he does. He presses the Riley insecurity button pretty hard. And then he—[laughs] your favorite, I'm sure he finds a blanket in the bushes on his way out to cover his head as he runs through the sunlight.
Jenny: No, no, no. He yells "blanket! Blanket!" and Riley furiously kicks the blanket out the door.
Kristin: Oh, really? I missed that!
Jenny: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Kristin: So there is a blanket, for sure.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Well, you know I love to see what Riley's up to. [Kristin laughs] I watch his every move very closely. So—
Kristin: Wait—
Jenny: The one thing that we—
Kristin: Okay.
Jenny: We didn't talk about is that, you know, while Riley is holding Spike in the sun and saying all kinds of shit and being like, "I'm the one who knows what Buffy needs." Spike is like, "oh, then how come you're not at the hospital right now?"
Kristin: Oh, right. Right.
Jenny: And that's how Riley finds out that Joyce has gone in for some tests and that that's where Buffy and Dawn are right now. And it's good that he has that information so he can go be there, but not—[laughs]
Kristin: Not that he got it from—
Jenny: Not without Spike being like, "oh. Funny, her not telling you. I've known for twelve hours."
Kristin: And I think that it's… so, leather is used in this show in very detailed ways. It's, you know, Buffy and Faith. Faith is leather-clad and by the end of the season of Buffy and Faith, Buffy shows up to kick Faith's ass and she's wearing red leather pants. Angel has a leather coat and he gives it to Buffy. Just a lot of leather here. And I have to say that I do believe that in the next scene, suddenly Riley shows up wearing a red leather coat that he keeps on himself for the balance of this episode. And I just feel like, you know, he was on his way to the hospital, [laughing] and he was like, "you know, maybe Spike's right. Maybe I'm not bad enough." And then in the window—
Jenny: Yeah, he's like, "pfuh, who's not dark enough now?"
Kristin: Yeah, and in the window, he saw—
Jenny: And then he like, pulls his sunglasses down in the rear-view and looks over the edge of them at himself and he's like—he nods affirmingly, "nice."
Kristin: [laughs] He goes, like, five miles over the speed limit on his way to the hospital. [laughter]
Jenny: Yeah! Relatable content!
Kristin: [laughs] So, okay. So getting serious, Riley is at the hospital. And this episode is called Shadow, and this is one of the reasons why. We find out, through the CAT scan, that they found a shadow in the scan of Joyce's brain and they need to do a biopsy to find out what this is. So it's very dark and concerning at the hospital and very sad.
Jenny: Yeah, this… sucks!
Kristin: I mean, you know, without jumping around too, too much, I do wanna say, they've teased it a little bit already. But this episode, it really digs into the demarcation—specifically, there's a line that's like, the medical and the magical don't often overlap. And we're really digging into that now, of like, this is a show about fantasy, about, you know, magic and demons and vampires. But also? It's a show about real life. And most of the tales that we get are told through the fantastical. And so they're really, in this episode, pushing down hard on the—this is not fantastical. Which I think is important to note.
Jenny: Yeah. Yeah.
Kristin: Okay, so we go to the Magic Box and there's a conversation. Tara, by the way—I think that Tara's hair is—maybe she dyed it or something? It's looking great. It's looking fantastic. [Jenny laughs] So just, you know, shout out to Tara's hair. And she is saying, "hey, what if we're not finding her in these books because she's not a demon? What if she predates the written word?" and they're sort of theorizing. And then this thing gets brought up, of like, well, they did say—when the Dagon Sphere, when they were researching the Dagon Sphere, "That Which Cannot be Named" was part of that information that they found. And I bring that specific line up, Jenny, because I think that the most incredible removal of Giles' glasses happens on that line.
Jenny: Ha, ha, ha!
Kristin: I have watched all the episodes to this point, and I think that this may be the best one. I would like to play him—
Jenny: Wow.
Kristin: It was so moving to me, how he removed his glasses when he said that, that I would like to play him his jingle.
NOTES: [GILES jingle plays] Giles! Hot dad! When you were younger you were real bad But now you're older, you got glasses That help you watch over us! Thank you, Giles!
Jenny: Wow! One for the books.
Kristin: [laughs] So yeah. You know, we're learning a little bit—or they're trying to piece it together. "How will we ever find her? She could be anywhere!"
Jenny: Right, right, right. "There's no way for us to determine her moves, her habits, where she'll turn up next," and as he says and turns… he's face to face with a petite blond woman in a red leather dress. It's fucking Glory! But nobody knows that 'cause Buffy's not in the shop. And Giles is like, "I beg your—" and Glory's like, "Uh huh!" [laughter] And it's really funny. They do a little business, he sells her some stuff, and then he comes back to the table and he's like, "ah, yes, what was I saying? Yes, she could be anywhere."
Kristin: [laughs] Yeah, it's a good—it's a good little silly television joke. I'm here for it, I like it.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, totally.
Kristin: That we as the viewer, of course, know who this is. So we cut back to the hospital, and this is where—so Riley, I think, is really a wonderful boyfriend in this episode. I really do. He goes—I mean, he kind of undoes some of his quality steps by the end, but we'll talk about it when we get there and why he's there and what—you know, what's going on for him. But he's in the hospital and he's taking care of Dawn. And in this scene, he takes off his red leather jacket. [Jenny laughs] But he takes off his jacket and he puts it over her while she's sleeping.
Jenny: Awww!
Kristin: It's really fucking sweet and really special and really—you know, I'm sure we've talked before on the podcast about just like, these moments that create family, right? That they're not really moments you can force or make happen, and this is one of those things. Something really bad is happening and everybody's really worried and shit needs to get taken care of. Dawn needs to be taken to school, picked up from school. These very practical moments that are happening between, you know, Buffy and Dawn, Dawn and Riley, Buffy and the Scoobies are all these new tethers of family that are being created.
Jenny: Right, right, right.
Kristin: So… yeah. And this is the scene where the doctor comes out and tells Buffy the results of the biopsy. Which is interesting. I wonder if any of you are listening and you are, you know, in the medical profession. If somebody has a biopsy done… maybe Joyce had already, you know, approved that they could tell Buffy. But I would imagine that that would have had to be cleared, right? That if—that they would have to tell Joyce first normally, the results of her test, before telling her kids, but maybe not. Maybe it's just if you're family—
Jenny: But maybe because Buffy's over 18—
Kristin: Right, right.
Jenny: It's a different thing.
Kristin: Yeah. So I don't know, but I'm curious, bufferingthevampireslayer@gmail.com, I would love to find out the actual way that this works. So it is a brain tumor, in laymen's terms. And this is, you know… we had a moment of Buffy on the stairs of the house at the end of Fool for Love that obviously was gutting. And her eyes, right, just—
Jenny: Are definitely doing the same thing.
Kristin: The same thing, they're just—they get, like—it's like a wide—[New York accent] a cute little doe-eyed deer. [normal voice] But it really is like a wide-eyed deer in the forest of just terror and sadness and fear and overwhelm, that we see in her eyes and it's just awful, awful to see. And Ben, good old Ben! Paging Dr. Ben!
Jenny: Oh, good old Ben. Paging Dr. Ben, could you please relieve this young woman who's being barraged with questions she couldn't possibly be expected to know the answers to.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Uh, yikes.
Kristin: Yeah, the doctor's asking her all manner of things. And I don't think this is an uncommon experience. I think this is an accurate reflection of, like, there are a lot of doctors in the world who are brilliant at being doctors and who are not very great at picking up on—
Jenny: Who have no bedside manner. Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: "So your mother has a brain tumor and one in three people—almost one in the three people with this condition make it. Anyway, do you know if she has a cell phone and do you know if her insurance requires copies of the MR—" like, what, dude?
Kristin: Right, right. So Ben comes over, makes up a lie about this doctor being needed in ICU. And then says to Buffy, "It looked like you could use a break." Which is really nice. It's a quick little Ben and Buffy moment. And then Buffy goes over to Riley and she's like, "I have to go find out a spell for this. I have to go find out what the magic is that will take care of this thing that's happening with my mom." And Riley just says, "People get sick." Which is interesting that—I mean, I think Buffy's in a—obviously in a state of panic and fear. But, you know, Riley doesn't have a ton of experience with magic, at this point. He's been around it, but you know, it's surprising to see him draw that line in this scene as quickly as he does.
Jenny: I think somebody has to, and also, I mean, he's not a stranger to the supernatural.
Kristin: That's true. That's true. I guess, yeah, he was in a laboratory of tin foil, doing medical work on fantastical creatures, so. Or at least, near it.
Jenny: Right, right, right.
Kristin: Yeah. So Buffy says to Riley, you know, not to tell Dawn anything yet. This is very reminiscent of me—I won't tell the full saga on this episode. But my mom went through a really terrifying medical ordeal when I was about Buffy's age, actually. And my sister was about Dawn's age and the dynamic was exactly what is unfolding here, where I was making sure that she was, you know, getting to school okay and getting the practical things. And she was not told the severity of what was happening with my mom. And so this is very—a lot of the way that this unfolds in the hospital in this episode is very familiar to me and I think they do a good job with it.
Jenny: Mmm.
Kristin: So.
Jenny: [sighs] So.
Kristin: In the words of Anya… [laughter]
Jenny: "Hey!"
Kristin: "Hey!"
Jenny: [yells] "Hey!" [laughter] Okay, so check this out. I watched this with closed captioning on, just to be sure. So Giles sold someone a Kohl's Amulet and Sobekium Bloodstone—
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: Of the Sobek people, so here's what I think happened. I think that a writer was like, what are words that I haven't… included yet, that haven't been introduced in the Buffyverse? Let's see, what's a place? [Kristin laughs] Ohh, there's that place where I got that pack of socks recently, Kohl's.
Kristin: Kohl's—it is Kohl's, right? K-O-H-L?
Jenny: It's K-O-H-L. And then, they're like, hmm, lizard, reptiles, hmm. Oh, and iced tea and flavored beverages. Sobe. Sobekium.
Kristin: Oh god!
Jenny: So I think this is—
Kristin: Fucking—oh my god.
Jenny: This is what I—this is my hypothesis, this is what I think is going on.
Kristin: Holy shit. That actually checks out, Jenny, because when—in this s  cene, I was like, ooh, Sobekium—Sobek, what is this? And I looked it up and I was like, ooh, this is—'cause you know, it's like 50/50 on this show. Sometimes I look things up and I find the article on Buffy, 'cause they've created it. And sometimes I find a whole history of this real thing that they're referencing. And Sobek is a real ancient Egyptian deity but he was a crocodile god.
Jenny: Ah… ha!
Kristin: Yeah. Who was either presented as a crocodile or as a human with a crocodile head. Which was really cool when I found this out, and I was like, oh, this is really drawing on this thing. And then I was like, wait, but it's not a crocodile, it's a fucking snake and they call it a reptile thing. So I'm actually going to support your thesis here that no one read anything except for a bottle of iced tea. [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah, maybe. Although now I'm looking at the Sobe Wikipedia—
Kristin: Mm-hmm.
Jenny: And Sobe actually allegedly is an abbreviation of South Beach or South Beach Beverage Company. [Kristin laughs] Which is now owned by Pepsi Co, which is headquartered in Purchase, New York, just across the street from my college.
Kristin: Wow. And there you have it. [singing] "The circle of life!"
Jenny: [laughter] Yeah, yeah.
Kristin: Okay, so. Regardless of how they came to this, it would have been nice—I would have preferred to have a human with a crocodile head be the demon in this episode, to be honest with you.
Jenny: Sure. Sure.
Kristin: But they realize that, through Anya being like, "you never sell these things together, you fool!" They put it together that, oh no, it was a small blond woman—
Jenny: Yes, yes, Giles is like, "why are you so worried? The young woman to whom I sold them would have had to have enormous pow… oh dear lord."
Kristin: [laughs] Record scratch. Everyone but Xander realizes that the girl was Glory, Glory was the girl.
Jenny: Right, right, right.
Kristin: We go to the Sunnydale carousel. Beautiful carousel that we have here in Sunnydale.
Jenny: Oh, yeah.
Kristin: And I would like to give a shout out to the fucking monks, who have created incredible memories here for our Key, Dawn. [Jenny laughs] I mean, just—the specificity.
Jenny: So rich.
Kristin: She's like, "it was my 10th birthday. My party was at the carousel, we had just moved here so nobody came, but my mom wanted to get her money's worth." I'm like, dang-guh! These monks spent like, at least six weeks creating this child's memories. [laughs] So shout out to them. But it's—this is very sweet. This is another—like, some points for Riley. Riley is—doesn't know what to do, and so he buys Dawn ice cream and takes her to the fucking carousel to try to cheer her up, which doesn't work, but the thought counts. And it's—
Jenny: I was watching this scene, feeling like, why is this carousel so familiar? That can't be right. But it's the carousel in Griffith Park!
Kristin: Oh, wow!
Jenny: Of course. Of course that makes all the sense, but I was like, man, those dirt paths are really ringing a bell right now.
Kristin: There's a definite—just—this is probably not a connection that is worthy of this podcast, but here goes.
Jenny: Ha!
Kristin: I'm pretty sure there's a big carousel scene in Buffy the Vampire Slayer the movie. I'm having a memory of a carousel. So I don't know, find out. Go ahead, go look. Run, scamper. [laughs] See if there's any connection. Come back to me. On that note, Jenny, why don't we take a moment to hear a word from some of our sponsors?
Jenny: Heck yeah.
NOTES: [Ad break]
Jenny: Okay, so. What's important about this scene besides Dawn's carefully sculpted, rich-in-detail memories, is that she's like, "mm. Buffy sure cries a lot less with you than she did with Angel." And Riley's like—
Kristin: Yeah. I thought you might be Team Dawn on this one, Jenny.
Jenny: [laughs] Riley's like, "oh, nice, she cried a lot with Angel?" [Kristin laughs] Thinking that things are gonna go his way, but without realizing it, Dawn kinda dashes him up against the rocks by letting him know that with Angel, it was like "every day was the end of the world, but she doesn't get all worked up like that over you."
Kristin: Mm, yeah…
Jenny: And then—[laughs] with only the self-perceived wisdom that a 12-yearold—or a 14-year-old can really possess, Dawn says, "I think you've been really good for her." [laughter]
Kristin: Well, like, I don't know—
Jenny: Which is accurate!
Kristin: I—I think that if Riley was not feeling this specific insecurity, he would understand Dawn's point. Because we've witnessed the relationship of Angel and Buffy and we've witnessed the relationship of Riley and Buffy. And what Dawn is trying to say is like, you are a much more serene presence in her life. There's not—you're not stirring the pot and sitting by your fireplace with your soul, brooding—you know. [laughs]
Jenny: Right.
Kristin: And there is validity to that observation, though we all know how I feel about Riley. I do get Dawn's point and I think that we see it in this episode, maybe more than we've seen in most other episodes, the way that he is sort of this figure of—she just kinda holds to him like a rock in this episode.
Jenny: Mm-hmm.
Kristin: Even though she's, you know, distracted with everything else. So. Anyhow. Let's go back to the Magic Box. We've already kind of discussed this conversation. Buffy walks in and she's like, "we need to find a spell" and they are pointing out to her that it's really complicated when you use magic for medical reasons. And I think Willow says something along the lines of, it's also her brain and so that's super complicated and if I—
Jenny: Yeah, delicate, delicate.
Kristin: Right. It's not something you want to fuck up, like, that would be a very bad fuck-up. They try to get Anya to pick up on the hint to not bring up Glory…
Jenny: [laughs loudly] Oh, and she catches what's going on just in time. [laughter]
Kristin: Which is very cute.
Jenny: The timing of this scene is really enjoyable.
Kristin: Yeah, yeah. It's very cute, it's very—Anya's really—she's starting to get a foothold. She's not there yet, but she's doing her best. And I'm here for it. And then of course, Buffy is like, "so how did she get away with these items? [Jenny laughs] How did she manage to get the amulet and—"
Jenny: Oh my god. And Anya putting the back of her hand up against the side of her mouth to be like, [whispers] "Giles sold it to her." [laughter]
Kristin: It's good. Let's give her her fucking jingle. Come on, she earned it.
NOTES: [ANYA jingle plays] [cash register rings] She spent one millennium, demonically vengeancin' Speaks her mind and then some, you know She's partial to the finer things And down with double boyfriends, oh yeah Exchanging cash for goods and also services She'd love to hold the money for ya (she'll hold that cash) Just keep the bunnies far from… Anya!
Jenny: Every episode, Anya gets a jingle!
Kristin: [laughs] So… we learn more of—kind of information about the reptile worshippers—
Jenny: The temple of Sobek, where they only drink Sobe!
Kristin: [laughs] It's actually located in South Beach.
Jenny: Right, right, right, of course.
Kristin: And they put it together that she's gonna make a cobra. And Xander gets a nice little one-liner in here, like, "ugh, why is it always snakes? Could it just be bunnies one time?" to Anya's fury.
Jenny: Horror!
Kristin: How dare you have ruined my dreams for a week with that, Xander?
Jenny: Yeah, yeah.
Kristin: And then we go to a place we have not been since Season 1, Jenny.
Jenny: Yes. It's… are you ready? It's the Sunnydale zoo! What's been going on? What kind of improvements have been made?
Kristin: Wow.
Jenny: We get any new animals?
Kristin: [laughs] Do you think that the cobra was there when the hyenas were there? Do you think—
Jenny: Yeah, they know each other?
Kristin: Right, like, he has some tales in his head, he's like, "I'll go find you your Key, Glory, but whew, later I gotta tell you the story about some hyenas." [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, they're in very different areas 'cause the cobra is in the reptile house, which—hey, weren't the Dursleys just here?
Kristin: [laughing] Yeah. So okay, so there's a cobra. A real cobra. It's unclear how many—how much of this is real cobra vs. fake cobra, but at least part of it is real cobra. They put the cobra into the classic cobra vessel. [laughter] Classic, just exactly where you think a cobra would be put.
Jenny: Yep, yep.
Kristin: Into this big vase and they start their incantations. Glory is, you know, accurately like, "god, these fucking incantations, man. They're always overwritten." [laughs] Just like, get to the point! [laughter] And in comes Buffy. Jenny, you are our wrestling expert. And maybe you have something to say about this fight, but I believe, knowing nothing about wrestling, that Buffy and Glory do a wrestling move called the Patrick Swayze in this scene. [laughter] I've made it up.
Jenny: Okay, so I don't remember any of the visual details of this fight, so let me guess what you mean by that.
Kristin: Okay, okay.
Jenny: At a certain point, Glory sidles up to the cobra vessel, puts her hands on it very gently, like one hand on each side. And then Buffy comes up behind her and puts her hands—
Kristin: [laughing] Oh my god!
Jenny: On top of Glory's hands. Is that what happens?
Kristin: You're in the wrong movie! You're in the wrong movie. [laughs]
Jenny: Oh, oh, oh. Oh! Oh.
Kristin: But amazing, incredible.
Jenny: Lift, and lift! And I carried a watermelon.
Kristin: Right. So I thought where you were gonna go is the classic Dirty Dancing move, which is above the head, right?
Jenny: Mm-hmm.
Kristin: Baby gets lifted above Patrick Swayze's head. But it's not that, it's actually the dance that Patrick Swayze teaches Baby, which contains one of the gayest scenes in 80s movies where Penny and Baby are learning—like, Penny is teaching Baby the dance. It's real gay. If you haven't seen it, go back and get a good look at that. But the part of the move in this dance that he first teaches her, it's sort of like, they both put their arms behind the other one's neck and then sort of pull out, so that their hands are then sliding down each other's arms? It's hard to describe.
Jenny: Mmm…
Kristin: But if you know Dirty Dancing and you saw this scene, you know what I'm talking about. I'm dubbing it the Patrick Swayze, so if it has a wrestling move, fine. Like, if it has a wrestling name, fine. But I'm calling it Patrick Swayze from now on. Cool.
Jenny: Oof.
Kristin: So—
Jenny: [makes vrin-vrin-da-da-da noise]
Kristin: Glory kicks Buffy's ass, and ends it by saying "scene." A really great nod to those of us who were theater kids. And then she says, "arise! Arise!" and the snake arises. And miracle upon miracles, Jenny, not only has the snake grown in size, but it has also sprouted two baby arms.
Jenny: Two little T-rex arms. [laughter] Two little kangaroo… li'l [inaudible].
Kristin: Just like, why? Why? Because I thought, is there—there must be a scene later where the arms come into play. Like, they must have needed the arms. Is he gonna open a jar? What is he gonna do with his arms?
Jenny: Well, you know what he needs them for is when he's going real fast—[Kristin laughs] when he's gliding real fast, he needs to hold them out in front of himself for balance. [laughter] You'll see!
Kristin: I will see. Unfortunately, I will never be able to unsee.
Jenny: But now, remember when we had a demon lizard that didn't have arms? That was also pretty bad.
Kristin: That's true. But I think this is worse. It looks like—it honestly looks, when we get to the CGI scenes, it looks like it's a snake on wheels with arms. [laughter] It just looks like it's a toy that a kid rolled across the room, except instead he's rolled it across Sunnydale.
Jenny: I mean, it really—the arms give it a real action figure-y kind of thing.
Kristin: Yeah. I guess it's true, it's for bal—I don't know. It's not good, guys. Anyway, Glory is like, "yo, the reason I have arisen you is because you need to go find the fucking Key. You have the vision in your shiny reptile eyes to see what I can't see and find the fucking Key."
Jenny: Hey, I just wanna say… sorry. I'm looking at pictures of the snake now. [laughs] Oh my god, did you see this picture of Sarah Michelle Gellar and the snake? [laughter]
Kristin: I did.
Jenny: [laughing] Holy shit! Oh my god! Okay. That's really good, but I'm looking at the arms. They're just like… I guess because the snake head is a bit larger than would be proportionate for the size of the head of the human that's inside this suit, it makes the arms seem a little smaller. But they're actually not super small feeling—
Kristin: Jenny—
Jenny: It's just that he's holding them up and as—
Kristin: I feel—I just feel like you're missing the point—
Jenny: What's the point?
Kristin: Which is not the size of the arms, but the fact that a snake does not have arms. [laughter]
Jenny: Well, maybe something happens, like evolutionarily, when, um, you know…
Kristin: [laughs] Yes. Sorry, continue. There's a girl with two pennies and a snake with arms.
Jenny: There's a girl with two pennies and a snake with some cute little arms…
Kristin: So Riley gets to the fucking Magic Box and is like, "you fucking let her go? Like, you let Buffy go to this fight?" And Giles, fucking understandably, is like, "Riley, you know Buffy. There's no letting or not letting, she does what she wants to fucking do." And then Xander sidles up for a mano y mano chat. [laughs] With—
Jenny: Whew!
Kristin: They really—I mean, not only do they have a deeply emotional conversation, but Xander also says "half-cocked" to Riley, so…
Jenny: Ha! Wow.
Kristin: Keep that in mind. They have a conversation about Buffy and Xander's concern about the fact that Riley has blown up the thing without—you know, like, what are you doing, man? And Riley walks out basically in kind of a huff, and he says—as he leaves, he's like, "you know, let me know if she needs me" in a way that is meant, of course, to convey like, she obviously will never need me.
Jenny: Right.
Kristin: He's feeling very overwhelmed. The cobra is having an adventure, Jenny.
Jenny: Wait, wait, wait. Before we go to the cobra, I just wanna highlight that at the very beginning of this scene that's back in the Magic Box, a customer is asking Giles for a copy of "Aleister Crowley Sings."
Kristin: Oh.
Jenny: Which, so far as I can tell, is not an album that actually exists, but are you familiar with Aleister Crowley?
Kristin: [laughs] No.
Jenny: Okay, so Aleister Crowley was an English occultist…
Kristin: Mm!
Jenny: Ceremonial magician, poet, painter, novelist and mountaineer. He founded the religion of Thelema, identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the Æon of Horus in the early 20th century.
Kristin: Oh my god!
Jenny: Yeah, he's got like, a whole thing.
Kristin: Wow! I had no—I didn't even hear the line and I had no familiarity, so thank you for that. Holy shit.
Jenny: Hey, no problem.
Kristin: Okay, so now can we go to church with the big snake?
Jenny: We can. Did you know that we've been to the outside of this building?
Kristin: No. Like we, you and me, Jenny and Kristin?
Jenny: I'm sure that when we—yeah, that's right. That is in Santa Barbara.
Kristin: Oh!
Jenny: We were taken there on our tour. [Kristin gasps] And it was very—I believe it was very near to a great field of roses.
Kristin: Oh, wow. Yeah!
Jenny: And I think if I'm remembering correctly that it's a monastery.
Kristin: Wow! Good… it's lucky that one of us has a brain that remembers things, you know?
Jenny: Uh-huh, it sure is!
Kristin: You gotta—listen, kids. If you're gonna start a podcast, make sure one of your two hosts has a memory.
Jenny: Yes. [laughs]
Kristin: It's very helpful to the content. [laughs] But what—so the cobra… listen. The cobra has a lot of open-ended questions for me. Why—he goes to the church first 'cause that's where the monks were, is that what we're to believe?
Jenny: I believe that's the idea. And it's also so we can get a—our first sweet close-up of that tail swishing across the floor.
Kristin: And we get, you know—I don't know if you all remember the doily pan-down—beautiful doily pan-down camera work that we got in—
Jenny: Ah!
Kristin: Season 2, maybe.
Jenny: Hell yeah.
Kristin: But we get a beautiful crucifix Christ pan-down to reveal the snake, which I think is very nice. [laughter] A similar move, different, from doily to Christ. Title of my memoir.
Jenny: [laughing] Your memoir, of course.
Kristin: Yeah. So, yeah. And then my other question is—it seems like the snake is very emotional, because it—to me and the timeline of the snake, it—the snake is calmly hunting. 'Cause he goes undetected, they couldn't find him, nobody could find him. And then as soon as he locates Dawn, he becomes very reckless and he is just willy-nilly all over the streets, knocking into people, everybody sees the snake. So are we to believe that the snake is excited, like he's excited that he's achieved his mission?
Jenny: I think—it read to me like there was some kind of mystical imperative. Like, find the Key. And then as—the second you fucking find it, you get back to me as quickly as you possibly can.
Kristin: I see, I see.
Jenny: That's what I got from it. I don't know if that includes knock over a fire hydrant, throw a rolling dumpster into the side of a small sporty red car…
Kristin: Uh, Giles' snake chase in that car is to be noted. [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah!
Kristin: He looks pretty great. He looks way better in that car than he looked in the Citroën, I think.
Jenny: Yeah. Yeah, good thing he's not driving that anymore.
Kristin: So there's a quick scene where Buffy calls on a payphone. [singing] "I'm at a payphone, doo-doo-doo-doo, doo."
Jenny: Oh boy. Oh boy. She's icing her shoulder, she's letting Giles know that the big snake is on the loose. And then we get like a melancholy music kind of montage—
Kristin: Mm, Melon Collie and the Infinite Montage.
Jenny: Right, exactly. Riley's at the bar drinking. Then Riley lets that girl vampire bite him, and he stakes her. I say… character assassination?
Kristin: [laughs] Yeah, I mean. This is like, whoa. What is even happening here? Riley's in—
Jenny: You know when you are—like, all of a sudden, you're in a car, going in one direction and then all of a sudden, you're in a car going in a totally different direction? But like, nothing really—it doesn't feel like anybody turned the wheel or anything. [laughs] You're just like, whoa! What's happening?
Kristin: Right, it is—yeah, it's almost—I mean, 'cause they pulled back, right—the Previously On brought us this scene from a while back where he's like, "she doesn't love me." And so they're pulling on these themes again, but—
Jenny: That was like—that was the first hard turn without a ton of… backup.
Kristin: Right, but it's also—I just feel like there are episodes that we've seen where it would have been even more believe—I still am like, I don't know about this turn. But it's just like, in this episode, it's—I don't know. I wanna be on the train that you probably—a lot of you want me to be on, which is like, "Riley couldn't take it, 'cause duh-duh-duh-duh-duh." But a lot of what we see in this episode is Riley doing really great things. And so it is a pretty hard turn that like, this insecurity has driven him to not talk to Buffy, to whatever. And when her mom has just been diagnosed with a brain tumor, to make this choice. And so if we're going to believe that Riley has made this choice, and this is not just the writers taking a turn, this is really shitty. Really shitty, really—like, a big bummer. But we'll see. We'll see where this goes.
Jenny: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.
Kristin: We continue with the big snake adventure. The snake is now sniffing the carousel horses. [laughter] And Dawn is at the Magic Box. Buffy comes in, they hug each other in this very tender moment. And Buffy's like, "has anyone seen the big snake?"
Jenny: [laughs] And the big snake is like, "I have!" And is like—smashes through the window and is like—
Kristin: [simultaneously] Yeah, the big snake, in a top hat and a cane, is like—
NOTES: [sings jazzy tune]
Jenny: "Oh yeah!" [laughter] We just went on our separate things there.
Kristin: Yeah, what did you say, and I'll tell you what I said. [laughs]
Jenny: Uh, I said, the snake smashes through the window and is like, "Oh yeah!"
NOTES: [laughter]
Kristin: That's pretty much—I think they could go together. Mine was in a top hat saying [sings jazzy tune].
Jenny: Oh, beautiful, Michigan J. Frog. [laughter] The actual…
Kristin: Yes. The WB…
Jenny: Mascot.
Kristin: He's learned a couple things from The WB frog.
Jenny: Right, right, right. [laughs]
Kristin: So—which I would have preferred, honestly. I would have liked the episode better if The WB frog was the demon. Okay, so the snake is like, sniff-sniff, sniff-sniff, puts his top hat down. And looks directly into Dawn's Key soul, as Dawn—A-plus screaming, Michelle Trachtenberg. Fantastic screaming.
NOTES: [Clip from episode plays of Dawn screaming]
Kristin: She's screaming, she's screaming, she's screaming and the snake is like, peace. Got what I needed.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: And Willow—
Jenny: And it's off to the races.
Kristin: Right, off to the snake races. And Willow is like, "Why was the snake afraid of Dawn?" And Buffy just looks at Giles, still the only person who knows what's up here, and says, "It knows."
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: And Giles is like, [car screeching noise]. [laughs]
Jenny: [car screeching noise] To the Giles mobile!
Kristin: [laughs] Okay, so they—so Giles learns her name is Glory, right. 'Cause Buffy says it in the car and he's like, "Glory?" and Buffy's like, "yeah, I heard the—"
Jenny: Dreg!
Kristin: "The minion call her that." So now everybody knows this person's name.
Jenny: Right, right, right.
Kristin: We also learn an incredibly important fact in the next scene which is that Glory loves to get shoes from Aldo.
Jenny: I wanted to talk about this, because there's nothing wrong with Aldo. But I feel like there is—
Kristin: Aldo is my choice of where to get shoes, but is—
Jenny: Sure, sure.
Kristin: But I am not Glory.
Jenny: It's not fancy. I wouldn't think—like, what's a luxury shoe that somebody living in a hotel room that has a round bed would wear?
Kristin: I do have to say though that—so I don't buy it. I don't buy that Glory would be—I think that, you know, she'd be getting some Carrie Bradshaw level shoes. But I also have to say that there may be a bit of Glory that's practical, because I get my shoes from Aldo. Because I do think—like, those super high patent leather heels that I wore to Prom, those were from Aldo. And—so they make high heeled shoes, they make fancy shoes, but they are a little bit more comfortable. So maybe Glory's just trying to—maybe she's got her really expensive red bottoms over in one closet but then she's got her Aldo, like, this looks hot but also is practical for fighting. That's the only way I can—yeah.
Jenny: Yeah, I can stand and suck brains in it all the day long.
Kristin: Exactly. Exactly. She's like, "tick freaking tock." And not to My Cousin Vinny us twice in one episode, but she's like, "My snake clock is ticking!" [laughs] Then we see snake on wheels.
Jenny: Ugh.
Kristin: And Buffy is—has overtaken the cobra, quite literally. Like Khaleesi on her dragon, Buffy—
Jenny: Wow! But with a chain and some choking.
Kristin: Mmhmm, Buffy sits atop of him.
Jenny: And this sneaky little fuck. This sneaky little fuck plays dead!
Kristin: Would you call him snakey little fuck?
Jenny: This snakey little fuck . Plays dead and tricks Buffy. And then it's back on!
Kristin: Yeah, just kidding! And then she's like, uh, okay, the chain didn't work so I'm gonna punch your snake face until you die.
Jenny: And this, like, sucks and obviously this is Buffy doing something about something 'cause she's powerless in the face of whatever's going on with her mother and her mother's health. And this is something she can do.
Kristin: Right. This is very reminiscent of Faith, actually. Remember the scene with—
Jenny: Oh my god…
Kristin: Yeah. Faith—where Faith is just obliterating that vampire. Or whatever.
Jenny: Right. Right, right, right. So psychologically, this is like… ugh. This is rough. But then, you know, what really takes the edge off is when they zoom out to a wide shot. And you see—
Kristin: [laughing] Yeah!
Jenny: Buffy punching the snake and it's like, rubber head is just like, b-b-bounce! B-b-bounce! B-b-bounce! B-b-bounce!
Kristin: [laughs] I had the thought of like, you know, as an actor. I saw—so a friend of ours and actually was on the podcast way, way, way back, Shannon Woodward. She posted something recently, I think it was about Cats. [laughs] And she was like—the quote was like, "when they tell you they'll fix it in post." You know? And it was like, fur—
Jenny: Oh, yeah.
Kristin: The image, it was like, the cat's actual hand—having actual human hands.
Jenny: Human fingers.
Kristin: And holding them like cat paws. [laughs] And I thought of that in seeing this. I was like, probably—you know, as an actor, you have to kind of believe that even though you're punching a ridiculous rubber snake head, they're gonna use all the tools they have to fix it for you later. And they did not. [laughs]
Jenny: No, they did not. No, they did not.
Kristin: Oh god. Okay, sorry. I laughed like that watching it and I forgot all about it, so I'm glad you brought it up again.
Jenny: Happy to help. And then from up on high, Glory is just continuing to stare out the window of her hotel. We assume she doesn't see Buffy punching the snake, 'cause she's not laughing. And she just keeps staring, waiting.
Kristin: She's like Bette Midler in Hocus Pocus. She's like, "boooook!" except she's like, "snaaaake!" [laughter] And her snake never comes. And so then we go from the fantastical to the harsh reality of the hospital. We end the episode where we began the episode, in the hospital, actually. And Joyce is about to tell Dawn.
Jenny: Ugh!
Kristin: Yeah, and so this is rough. And I don't like what they do with Riley here either. Because they really—they—you know. So if you haven't just rewatched, this scene in the hospital is like, Buffy is like "I'll send Dawn in by herself and you can talk to her." And she goes out into the hallway and Riley comes up. And Riley says to—first of all, Riley's wearing the classic, classic wear—
Jenny: Well!
Kristin: Of that post-hickey slash vamp makeout sesh.
Jenny: The best thing—the best thing about Riley getting bit in the neck by a vampire is that he's got a reason to wear this turtleneck. Dig that shit out of the back of your closet, my boy, and put it on, post-haste.
Kristin: [laughs] So Riley holds her and says like, "let it out." And she says, very understandably, "I can't." We all know this emotional state, right? Where you know if you even so much as let out one tear, you're not stopping and then you're not gonna be able to get it under control. And that's basically what she says.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Right? "They need me and if I start, I won't be able to stop." And what I don't love is—and I know it's connecting to what we saw with Riley and the vamp and whatever. But I just really believe, after everything we've seen Riley do in this episode with Dawn and whatever, that in this environment, I don't… [sighs] I know I'm betraying so many of you. But I don't buy that Riley in the hospital with this is gonna feel left out. It seems like the situation is too extreme for what we're seeing manifest in Riley at the end of the episode. I buy it in the grave—in the cemetery, I buy it with the demons, I buy it with the fighting, I buy it in all those places. But I just—I think that for most of us, and I do include Riley in this, I think that when somebody is sick and you're in the hospital, these things don't come to the surface unless you're an actual asshole. Which I—believe it or not, I don't think Riley is actual asshole. I think that he would have understood this and he would have just sat down in that hospital chair and waited for them to come out.
Jenny: Yeah, it doesn't feel true to his character. The only kind of sense that I could make of it is that we're to take—like, I could understand maybe a little bit more if we were to take Riley being left alone in the hall after that exchange, as like, all he wants to do is to be there for her. But maybe it's kind of feeling like…
Kristin: He can't help, no matter what.
Jenny: He can't help, no matter what. Maybe he's feeling a little bit like, she doesn't need me. Maybe he's feeling—another thing that I was thinking about was like… Riley clearly wants to be a partner.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Riley wants to be in partnership. And it doesn't necessarily always feel like Buffy does. I don't think we ever see Buffy thrive in partnership.
Kristin: Right, and that's—it's the overtasked person. I mean, obviously her tasks are a bit heftier than some of ours. But, you know, she's putting out so many fires so much of the time that it's not very possible or accessible for her to be in partnership in that way.
Jenny: And so maybe what we're to take from this last shot of him is like, it's really maybe starting to sink in a little bit that perhaps they don't want the same things out of a relationship.
Kristin: Yeah, I like that interpretation more than the way I saw it. And sometimes my—you know, I—recently, friend of the pod Joanna Robinson framed the way that I view things as, I am an emotional viewer. And it really resonated for me. Like, I get very emotionally invested in things when I watch them, I'm not a critic at heart. I don't—it has to be pretty fucking bad for me to be like, this was bad. I get invested. So sometimes I conflate what I don't—what I didn't want to be happening in this scene is what I kind of made the scene in my mind. So I like your assessment a little bit better than mine. And I get that, and I also get how some of Riley's insecurities can obviously make the jump from, you know, fighting and demon stuff to just everything when you're feeling really overwhelmed and like you aren't getting what you need. And I think that that's correct. So. Yeah, it's pretty somber. Okay, let's take a turn. Let's take a turn out of this somber corner of discussion and go headlong into… the Sexual Tension Awards.
NOTES: [SEXUAL TENSION AWARD jingle plays] Sexual tension award!
Jenny: Well! It's time once again for the most important part of the podcast, the Sexual Tension Awards. [Kristin laughs] For this episode, we respectfully and humbly submit the following nominees for your consideration. First up, for a smokey little exchange of "I don't know what kind of action you're looking for," it's Xander and Riley! Let them live! Let them love! Let them laugh!
Kristin: Cast your votes for the half-cocked couple.
Jenny: Ha-ha!
Kristin: Second up, we have Glory and her shoes. She is very into her shoes and the way they feel on her perfect feet.
Jenny: And how they highlight her ankles or fail to do so.
Kristin: Mm, yes.
Jenny: Third up, well. I think this is the only actual character's mouth touching part of character's—other character's body? Thing that happens in the whole episode. It's Riley and Sandy the vampire.
Kristin: Yeah. I mean, I would call that sexual tension. You know. And last but not least, Jenny, I'm a big—a lifelong fan of the film Dirty Dancing.
Jenny: I know you are.
Kristin: I've watched it over and over and over again in my youth, in my adulthood. And I would be remiss if not to nominate Glory and Buffy for their beautiful wrestling fight dance move that I named the Patrick Swayze.
Jenny: [laughs] Great. Great, great, great.
Kristin: [laughs] You can participate in our Sexual Tension democracy over on our Twitter. What's our Twitter, Jenny?
Jenny: It's @BufferingCast. Please.
Kristin: The poll will stay open for one week, so get on over there and vote and we'll see who wins. This was not an episode rife with sexual tension. We did our best, we hope we did you proud.
Jenny: Yes.
NOTES: [SEXUAL TENSION AWARD jingle plays] Sexual tension award!
Kristin: Alright, Jenny! We've done it yet again. First episode of 2020. We've got snakes, we've got hospitals, we've got… some other stuff. [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah, and if you haven't seen the picture at this point of the man cobra in a towel holding a roll of toilet, do yourself—
Kristin: [laughing] "Man cobra."
Jenny: A favor. And look up that image.
Kristin: Yes, please do. Jenny, when you are not looking at beautiful pictures of man cobras in towels, where can people find you?
Jenny: [laughs] Well! Well! I'm Jenny Owen Youngs and when I'm not watching Buffy and shopping at Kohl's and chugging Sobe, I'm usually writing and recording songs.

And also you can hear more of my speaking voice over on my other television recap podcast about a tiny, blond protagonist, Veronica Mars Investigations.
Kristin: Jenny, the New York Times wrote about your fucking holiday song.
Jenny: Oh yeah! No big deal. It was like, we picked 13 songs, they're by, you know, a group of peers including Taylor Swift. Blink 182.
Kristin: Wow.
Jenny: Macklemore. Jenny Owen Youngs. Some other people are on that list.
Kristin: Pretty fucking fantastic. So, yeah.
Jenny: Pretty cool, very cool. Thank you, New York Times.
Kristin: Way to round out the decade, Jenny.
