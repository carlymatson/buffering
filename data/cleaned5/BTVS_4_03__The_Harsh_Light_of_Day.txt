Kristin: Hello there Scoobies, Kristin here to tell you that before we get into today's episode I have a few announcements. First, we mentioned a couple of weeks ago in the intro that we'd have a few structure changes this summer as Jenny and I journey through our separation. And as such this week's episode, Harsh light of day, is going to be hosted by myself, and the always brilliant Joanna Robinson, writer at Vanity Fair, host of many podcasts, massive Buffy fan and one of our favorite guests of all time. Jenny, of course, will still be with us for the song at the end, plus she's coming at us hot hot hot with a sexual tension award segment within the episode. Jenny will also be guesting on next week's Angel on top crossover episode, In the dark. Then the two of us will be back at it again in two weeks when we bring you Halloween in July and so much Anya with Fear itself. Also, speaking of Joanna Robinson if you're a Patreon supporter, you got a very special bonus episode last week where Joanna and I discussed Living conditions. Joanna refers to it as the alt track of Living conditions, which I love. You can find that by going to bufferingthevampireslayer.com and clicking on patreon. A couple of important event announcements, first, in just three days on June 23rd, Saturday, this Saturday! I host on of my favorite events of the whole year, the All-ages Pride party that I do in collaboration with Autostraddle. This year we are sponsored by The Tegan and Sara Foundation, w e're g oing to have music from Emily Wells, spoken word from the slam team at Urban Word i n New York City. It's totally free, it's from 1 o'clock until 3 o'clock at Housing Works bookstore in New York City, so I hope to see some of your beautiful faces there. Also, on July 8th, Jenny and I will be doing a live taping of Beer bad at Littlefield in Brooklyn. Those tickets sold out as of yesterday, which is very exciting, because that means a lot of you are going to be with us on July 8th. But for those of you who didn't get tickets stay tuned, we'll let you know if any additional tickets are released or if there are door tickets that will be released the day of the show.

Kristin: Hello and welcome to Buffering the Vampire Slayer a podcast where we will be watching and discussing every episode of Buffy the vampire slayer, one by one, spoiler free, I'm Kristin RussoJoanna: And I'm special guest Joanna Robinson!
Kristin: Yeahaha!
NOTES: [both laughing]
Kristin: This week we are talking about season 4 episode 3 The Harsh Light of Day, which is a Spike episode, which is really why you're here Joanna, I mean, let's be real.
NOTES: [both laughing]
Kristin: Stay tuned at the end of this podcast every week for an original song written by Jenny Owen Youngs and I recapping the Buffy episode we are discussing.
Joanna: The Harsh Light of Day was written by Jane Espenson and directed by James A. Contner and it originally aired on October 19th 1999.
Kristin: Yes, and this is the one where as Buffy gets to know a charming student named Parker, Spike searches for a ring that according to legend makes the wearer invincible.
Joanna: Oh Parker, you charmer!
Kristin: [laughs] Ugh, I wish that I had a memory of Parker before this episode so that I would know how I felt about him, because now everything that comes out of his mouth just makes me want to murder him.
Joanna: Yes.
Kristin: [laughing] You know?
Joanna: True. So true.
Kristin: [laughing] Right? There's a lot of - we won't jump right into the jingle- but there's a lot of the fucking patriarchy, I think, hanging out here in episode 3 of season 4.
Joanna: Yeah it's a pretty rough one I think you texted me after you were done with your- what did you say? Like "WHAT AN EPISODE" in all caps right?
Kristin: Yes! Cause it is!
Joanna: It is.
Kristin: As I took my notes I was like "oh shit! right" and I just watched it not even that long ago but I forgot how many things I was gonna all caps take notes in you know? [laughs]
Joanna: Yeah.
Kristin: Actually my very first note Joanna is in all caps and it is "DEVON IS IN A BELLY SHIRT" [laughs]
Joanna: Umm… what is my Devon shirt note? it just says "DEVON SHIRT" all caps.
NOTES: [both laughing]
Kristin: Ok so Dingoes ate my baby is playing at The Bronze and up until this episode I've had sort of not very many feelings about Devon you know, I'm like that's Devon he sings in Dingoes ate my baby. But I was sort of appalled by his shirt and then immediately attracted to him in like all at one moment [laughs] It was really intense. [Joanna laughs] It was a really intense experience for me so I just want you to know that I am apparently attracted to dudes in bands wearing belly shirts.
Joanna: It's just such a belly shirt, it's a crazy belly shirt cause it's like Devon doesn't seem to be the kind of guy who would wear a belly shirt at all and it's not terribly sexy, it's weirdly sized, I don't know but you loved it so… a lid for every pot and a belly shirt for every Buffy watcher.
Kristin: [laughs] Yeah, I think that the 90s really got into my head a little nugget of that hipline, you know the hipline in the 90s how that was a real thing? Abercrombie and Fitch happened and dudes would wear their pants low and we were taught as a society that something sexy- it was like when ankles were really sexy, in the 90s it was the weird hipline that happens on some dudes. So I think it just triggered that marketing materials in my head.
Joanna: The thirst trap I believe is what some people call it.
NOTES: [both laugh]
Kristin: Yes, exactly.
Joanna: It's so funny because I know this took place in '99, fall of '99. The 90s are winding down in this episode but a lot of the fashion, and I know that I'm not your fashion expert but a lot of the fashion in this episode- my notes just scream "so oughties, so oughties, so oughties" which is like- the oughties are a terrible word but so 2000s.
Kristin: Yes, also I've never heard the oughties but I like it and I feel like it's dangerous because are you saying the oughties or are you saying the eighties really oddly. [laughs] Which one is it?
Joanna: Or the naughties. The naughty oughties.
Kristin: That's actually right where this falls is in the naughties. So speaking of naughties- no that's a horrible transition but I went there so we're doing it. Parker is playing some pool at the Bronze and Buffy is watching him in the mirror which is really very fun because she can finally see a boy she likes in a mirror, how novel.
Joanna: I know, it's good for stalking.
NOTES: [both laugh]
Joanna: Like light, gentle stalking, yeah yeah yeah.
Kristin: Totally and Willow has this amazing line where she's like "Buffy's having lusty wrong feelings" but then goes out of her way to be like "they're lusty but actually they're not wrong at all Buffy, own your sexuality, your sexy feelings are good".
Joanna: I don't know, this is [sighs] this is such an interesting episode because it is both like this is another sex morality episode. I like that I'm here for the sex morality episodes for Buffy.
Kristin: I think they go arm in arm with Spike episodes, there must be some kind of overlap.
Joanna: But yeah, this is a harsh- well harsh light of day, harsh lessons about sex episode but also there's a lot of sex positivity in this episode along with sex negativity but it just feels like it really changes the whole conversation around sex which makes sense given that this is for a lot of kids going from high school to college completely reframes your attitudes around sex, right? And so the spaces this episode makes for some sex positivity along with some of these are the pitfalls of sex and by pitfalls I just sort of mean emotional fallout ramifications. So this is Willow just being like yeah Buffy come on you dated this shitty tortured vampire for so long, date Parker cause Willow doesn't know that Parker is worse than Angel. But she's like date Parker, he's such a nice- he's a human boy and it'll be fun, you guys can have sex and it'll be great and we'll talk about it, you know. Willow's trying for sex and dating positivity here.
Kristin: Totally, totally, also "he's a human boy" is just a really great sentence. "He's a human boy, date him Buffy, it'll be good for everybody".
Joanna: It's a low, low bar to clear but Parker clears it, technically a human Parker.
Kristin: [laughs] Also Parker- and there's a lot of these little moments so probably I'm not gonna call all of them out but this moment that Parker has at the end of this scene where he's like "You might not be safe walking home" as a line to get in Buffy's pants, it was really upsetting to me. This idea of I'm a dude and I'll protect you but really my motivation is to sleep with you, I didn't like it, I don't like it.
Joanna: Guess what? It gets worse. [laughs]
Kristin: Spoiler alert, it gets so much fucking worse. Lots of all caps, I warned everybody- actually I do have all caps coming up for the next moment in the show which probably you know what my all caps are about Joanna. They're about Harmony and I just wrote "OMG OMG HARMONY YES" because I am so thrilled- I think if you're watching the series for the first time maybe it was a little confusing about how enthusiastic I was about Harmony. I couldn't keep it to myself, now you're getting why. This was in my brain the whole time, Harmony is fucking back and Harmony is a fucking vampire, also Harmony is fucking Spike, so many things.
Joanna: Yes, vampire Harmony is the best and, I mean it's funny because your enthusiasm for Cordelia in the first three seasons, and we do miss her so, but your enthusiasm for Cordelia is so fun for me because I'm wondering if people watching it for the first time are having that experience with Cordelia because when I watched it for the first time as a teen I was not really into Cordelia at all. And then as an adult I'm like Cordelia rules though [laughs] and so maybe people thought your enthusiasm for Harmony was a splash over from Cordelia but no Harmony is awesome in her own right, especially in her new life as a vampire so here we go vampire Harmony versus Willow and Oz.
NOTES: [laughs]
Kristin: God and her first line before she vamps is you know her and Willow are being like oh, haven't seen you how was your summer and they talk about graduation for a half a second and Harmony just says "big snake, huh?" [both laugh] which I love.
Joanna: It's so good.
Kristin: And also Harmony in this episode, this is the first time that I had this connection in my mind but Harmony in this episode, vamp Harmony, reminds me a little bit of Donna Martin but vamped. If Donna Martin from 90210 was vamped I feel like she would have a similar attitude to Harmony or similar speak, the way that Harmony speaks reminds me of Donna Martin.
Joanna: Yeah, if Donna Martin graduated, no she didn't graduate don't worry.
Kristin: Spoilers for 90210, she fucking graduates.
Joanna: Yeah, Donna Martin graduates and goes to college and is a vampire. Though Harmony is obviously not enrolled in classes. It's a shame, she should be. Maybe she'd take some French and that would make her happier.
Kristin: [sighs] Yes, right?
Joanna: But yes Harmony versus Willow and Oz and Willow and Oz make it out but barely and Harmony talks about her boyfriend. And I wonder- I'm just so curious if people watching this show for the first time who know the rules of storytelling, so know that when Harmony says my boyfriend, my boyfriend, my boyfriend it's probably gonna be someone either interesting or we know but if anyone saw the Spike twist coming cause it's so good.
Kristin: Yeah, I can't imagine- only the very smartest of the people because my brain would not have gotten there, you know I didn't see Spike coming back. Although I guess Spike is in the credits so maybe the really intuitive people were like maybe this is why Spike is in the credits.
Joanna: Yeah, I was about to say if you saw James Marsters name in the credits maybe- 'cause he's not a series regular yet right?
Kristin: Right.
Joanna: He and- I guess I shouldn't say who else but anyway yeah. I used to play that game a lot with Buffy and other shows that I watched obsessively before I became a tv critic and everything was already pre-spoiled for me but back in the days you could get a little spoiled by whose name is in the opening credits. So watching a Buffy I would get really excited if I saw Danny Strong- I'm like ooh! Jonathan's in this episode! In the guest starring crawl at the beginning.
Kristin: Totally.
Joanna: So yeah, Spike's here.
Kristin: Spike's here, also just a shout out to- if you missed the way that Harmony runs offscreen after she does her "I have a boyfriend and he's gonna be mad" I suggest you go back and watch her turn around and jauntily run off in her little outfit cause it's good, it's real good.
Joanna: Yes, yes.
Kristin: So… [sighs] Parker. Parker loves Buffy's fucking scar, of course Parker loves a scar, of course Parker loves anything that's gonna get Buffy to be into Parker. I enjoy the fact that Buffy credits the scar to an angry puppy because I feel she did not lie. [laughs] I feel like that was the truth. If I could describe Angel in any way right, an angry puppy.
Joanna: And that's something that goes forward in the fandom, people call Angel "angry puppy" all the time so, yeah.
Kristin: And also Willow called Angel "puppy" in the alternate universe so…
Joanna: Oh that's true, that's true, that's true.
Kristin: A lot of overlap here with this little tiny moment and then of course there's this amazing Angel reference "don't you just hate guys who are all dark and broody and give me love" and it's like yeah okay we get it.
Joanna: Yeah, Parker is like this human and slightly shittier- If you listen to the bonus version of Living Conditions, the alt-track of Living Conditions that you and I recorded I think I pointed out that the actor who plays Parker looks enough like Angel- he looks like Xander and he looks like Angel. He's on that spectrum and I think that that's important. Not just that Buffy has a type necessarily but just this idea of Parker as a human Angel counterpart. I keep wanting to get ahead of everything but what this episode does to mirror Becoming part one and two, what it does to humanize- anchor that in a human experience you know is really interesting.
Kristin: Right, right, I know, this whole time I'm thinking is Buffy ever gonna get to sleep with somebody where [laughs] something horrible doesn't happen right after? This is like a one two punch, it's one thing for it to have happened once but for it to happen again is pretty rough. Buffy has a lot of shit to work through, as if she didn't already she's the chosen one, give her a break! So let's go to Giles' house shall we?
Joanna: Yeah! I love it.
Kristin: Fucking Xander and Giles sorting books is great, it makes me very happy [laughs]
Joanna: It's delightful that Giles is paying Xander whatever, a pittance, to sort some books and I just love- you know sometimes you get fun little pairings on this show that you didn't know you wanted and needed more of and I'm like yeah, I do want more of Giles and Xander together.
Kristin: Yeah, college really opens up some possibilities for us- some that we've seen and some that we have yet to see that I'm very excited about.
NOTES: [laughs]
Joanna: Yes. Yes. And then we get the return of everyone's favorite vengeance demon, right?
Kristin: [sighs] She's back.
Joanna: I mean, Harmony and Anya in the same episode, come on!
Kristin: I know, it's a lot to take and Anya fucking- this moment between Anya and Giles is so brief but it's so incredible the way they're just glaring at each other and not saying too much but hating each other so very much about that whole necklace ordeal. It's just really special.
Joanna: Well and this also feels like, I don't know if you agree with me, I feel like this is a big retcon for this character. The character really changes between when we meet her in season three and when we meet her in season four and I don't mind it at all. I really like both versions of Anya. I don't think there's a good explanation for it but I like this version of Anya and I remember I was trying to convince a friend of mine who was really into Star Trek to watch Buffy when we were in college. So I think it was like season five or something like that and I was telling her about all the characters. And I was like well there's one character who doesn't understand the way the world works so has to have things explained to her. And she's like oh, the Data, that's the Data character and I was like yeah. So I always think of Anya and you get it in this episode as someone who's like I don't understand how you humans function, would you explain it to me sort of thing. Does that make sense?
Kristin: Yeah, totally. I've always sort of understood her shift but maybe my timeline is off. My shift for her was the moment that she went from demon to human but I think maybe right, in season four it gets very, very extreme where she really becomes, not the Amelia Bedelia, but of that way of taking everything very literally and having to unpack situations that she doesn't understand apart from their face value as presented.
Joanna: I love that I was like let me give you my Data reference and you were like let me give you an Amelia Bedelia reference.
Kristin: [laughs] I think it really sums us up Joanna.
Joanna: Yeah, I will be really interested to hear what your listeners think, like who the Anya character represents for them. But Anya is here and this is so clever, it ties in so well to the theme of the episode because I also watched this episode recently and then just rewatched it. But rewatching it again I was like you know, she's talking to Xander about expectations and hopes of relationships because she doesn't understand how things work. And this is what I was talking about when I was talking about sex positivity because she's like I had my dream and in my dream you're naked sometimes or whatever, right? And I feel like that's a brave step forward for Buffy where there was good sex and bad sex in the high school years but it was all either demure or someone was like a snack maybe like ooh totally snackable but this whole I've had naked dreams about you and I'm just gonna talk about it right here, right now feels like a progression.
Kristin: Yeah, it's also really brilliantly done, I think, because Anya is like you said so vulnerable without even understanding that she's being vulnerable. Bold without understanding that she's being bold and even Xander in this exchange- or no, I guess it's the next time we see the two of them together, sort of makes a comment about how this is even more romantic, despite her forwardness, despite her bluntness, her boldness feels more romantic, more emotionally connected to him than of course Faith did. And it also sets up the fact that a woman taking power and saying what she wants can be very enjoyable and wonderful and good and it doesn't always have to be set up in this dynamic which [sighs] we'll go down the Buffy wormhole as the episode unfolds but yeah I think it's a good counterpoint and super positive.
Joanna: Yeah, absolutely. I mean as positive as it can get for this episode.
NOTES: [laughs]
Kristin: Right, I mean yeah. Within the context of the episode, within the context of 1999, I'm here for it. So… what happens next? Parker tries to kiss Buffy and at least is deterred in this one moment because Oz and Willow come to tell them, well to tell Buffy that Harmony is back and Harmony is a vampire. Which this scene, I had a question about for you and college. Did you lock your dorm room door in college?
Joanna: Yes!
Kristin: You did?
Joanna: Yes.
Kristin: We never locked- we never closed our door. Our door was just always wide open and so when I saw Buffy using her key I was like did I even have a key? Was that something that- I'm sure we did but we just never used it.
Joanna: What kind of school did you go to?
Kristin: Well I went to a billion schools but the one that is rooted in my freshman and sophomore years and the one I have the most dorm memories from is SUNY Binghamton so it was a state school. And I lived in a big dorm with I don't even know how many people were in my dorm but several people on a floor, the floor shared bathrooms, the whole thing. Certainly we probably should have been locking our doors but I was like seventeen slash eighteen years old so I just didn't think about it. [laughs]
Joanna: Yeah, I went to a UC, not UC Sunnydale unfortunately, and we had to use a swipe card to get into the building.
Kristin: Oh, yeaaaaah.
Joanna: But anyone could catch the door behind you and one bit of crime that happened- I'm just gonna talk about it because it's my favorite bit of audacious crime I can remember. I went to UC Davis which is a huge bikingeveryone was a biker, not a motorcycle biker like a biker biker.
Kristin: A hippy biker. [laughs]
Joanna: So there's bikes everywhere and my freshman year, it was move out day and so everyone has moving trucks and stuff like that. So someone just rented a small U-Haul, pulled it up to the back of the dorm and actually literally picked up full bike racks.
Kristin: [gasps]
Joanna: And threw the racks with all the bikes into the back of the moving truck and just stole so many bikes.
Kristin: Oh my god!
Joanna: It's like you kind of admire the audacity of the crime even though it's terrible.
Kristin: Really dramatic and I kind of like it. I mean, sorry to all of you who lost your bikes in the 90s? No, when were you in college? In the aughites?
Joanna: The aughts, the aughties. [laughs]
Kristin: But props to that person for ingenuity and boldness.
Joanna: Right, because move out week, so no one's gonna look twice at a moving truck and then they just sort of went for it. Hit a bunch of dorms around campus, it was pretty amazing. Anyway, yes, long story short I did lock my door.
Kristin: But did you lock your bike? If you did it literally didn't matter because the whole thing got taken. [both laugh]
Joanna: It didn't matter anyway.
Kristin: So, this is when we find out who fucking Harmony is dating, and it's fucking Spike. And this reveal, I know it's whatever but I'm really into it. The fact that it's like we're underground and then there's this man and he's sinewy and working on this wall or whatever he's doing and he's got this cloth over his head and she pulls it off to reveal that platnium hair that we know so well and it's fucking Spike.
Joanna: You know I love Spike. Sinewy is so perfect, Marsters is always sinewy, even now on Runaways he's a sinewy fellow. Yeah, I wrote camera pan down, cause it starts on the street level and then goes literally underground, it's so cheesy and bad and good. And of course it's a super cheesy, dramatic reveal and I'm here for it. Oh sorry, I wanna hop back really quickly because Willow and Oz are telling Buffy that Harmony's back, Harmony's a vampire, and [laughs] you know I like to stop and pause for the Oz moments so take an Oz pause. A real quick Oz pause to notice him first tending to the wound on Willow's neck, awww. And then he's talking about how Devon dated Harmony and he says that Harmony's too flakey for Devon and then he says "stop and marvel at the concept". So just an Oz pause for that line which is a great Oz line and then we can return to sinewy Spike underground.
Kristin: I love "Oz pause" you know, it's just really good, it deserves it's own little jingle. The Oz pause.
Joanna: I know, I'm sorry that it took two seasons to get here or whatever but here we are.
Kristin: [laughs] So yeah, I mean, I'm exploring my feelings for Spike this time around because my feelings for Spike were very clear to me after my first viewing of the series which is I really like Spike, Spike is my favorite character, I wanna make out with Spike. I really want Spike to throw me up against walls, these are my feelings and I can't help them.
Joanna: Right in front of Ryan?
Kristin: And I'm really into Harmony and Spike, I mean obviously it gets more problematic as the episode goes on but in the outset their dynamic where Spike is angry and Harmony is into it and then Spike is into Harmony being into it, I'm here for it, I like it. I feel like she really plays off of his energy in really good ways. We turn a corner later but for a moment I'm here with it, I'm very happy about it.
Joanna: [sighs] I love Spike, you know I love Spike, we love Spike, some of your listeners may not love Spike and I respect that stance but I love him so much. I think he's both dreamy and hilarious and that's a rare combination so there we go. You listeners are welcome to psycho-analyze me and talk to me about why I'm messed up for loving Spike, but I do.
Kristin: And that's how I'm progressing through the series this time, watching myself watch Spike and being like what is going on with you? to myself, what's going on here? Why are you so into it? I don't know and the dichotomy of Harmony and Spike too where Harmony is calling him "blondie bear" and just saying these things that are so anti-Spike but that you see her doing it on purpose. It's not even like she's just saying the things, she's saying them because she knows it's gonna make him angry and she likes when he's angry cause then they fuck, you know? It's like this whole game.
Joanna: Yes, I don't know if only terribly sad english majors play this game [laughs] like myself, but there's a game one can play when one goes to see Shakespeare at the theater. You go see a Shakespeare play and you're like alright, that's a line that people quote, that's a line that people quote, that's a line- and you sort of rack 'em up. Even in plays you don't expect would have so many lines that people use or have been used to name books or plays or whatever it is. My english teacher in high school sort of started me on that and that's just a thing I do is keep tally of the notable lines. And I would say "angry puppy" and "blondie bear" are two iconic Buffy phrases that come from this episode.
Kristin: Yes, also I like that the game is just keeping track of the lines.
Joanna: That's it. There's no winner. [both laugh] Only losers in this game.
Kristin: I was waiting for and then after you keep track of them all you do this thing and then suddenly realized the whole game is just noting the lines.
Joanna: [laughs] Oh my god, I wanna go back to Amelia Bedelia jokes.
Kristin: [laughs] Ohhhhh, okay so… here we are if we're ready to go to this party where fucking Biff Naked is just playing this party at college.
Joanna: This is very Peach Pit after dark, that's another 90s 90210 reference where super famous bands would just play the Peach Pit and you're like okay… The Cranberries are here, sure they are. Anyway, Biff Naked is playing a UC Sunnydale party, totally normal.
Kristin: Yeah, and obviously now we're in season four of Buffy so Buffy's doing very well for itself so of course we're gonna start to see bigger names playing, not even the Bronze now, they just straight up play college parties. I think she has pretty great features on the episode too. We hear two of her songs, one of them very clearly the full chorus and yeah. So Spike and Harmony are here, they're picking up some dinner because Harmony did win the argument which I like. She was like take me out and Spike did it.
Joanna: [sighs] Yeah, she did a little Rent, a little Daphne Rutabaga "take me out tonight" and yeah…
Kristin: Wow, coming out strong with the fucking references this episode Joanna. You're really hitting me in all the feels.
Joanna: If I didn't get you with my great Shakespeare game or my bike larceny then surely I will get you with some Rent lyrics. Anyway, yes they are at the party and it's great because there's always just this thing between Buffy and Spike as far as I'm concerned. I consider them like a will they won't they, and what they do in this episode is hardcore judge each other's dates. [both laugh] He's like "So, Parker?" She's like "Harmony, really?" This is some romcom shit is what this is.
Kristin: A hundred percent, also a note that I had was not only are they assessing each others current dates but they also use each other's exes as a fighting tool, both of them in different points of this episode. Of course Buffy going in this scene with Dru, this is later after they leave the party but she uses Dru as "she left you, blah, blah, blah" And then fucking Harmony behind the fight is perfect Harmony, "she left him for a fungus demon". [laughs] And he's already annoyed and then again perfect Harmony "when we find the gem of Amara you'll be sorry" and he's like "God damn it Harmony!"
Joanna: Harmony- Okay once again I know that Kate Leth is on this episode but this is the first Harmony outfit of many. They're all great but this is the Harmony look that I was like this is every college party that I went to cause I was in college at this time and so she's got a tube top on with an asymmetrical strap and then her hair is sort of down but braided back and very hardcore reined in. And she just looks like- I don't know what it is about the early aughts but it's like clean but club-y but soft but modern and she's got her makeup done a little differently and I was just like yep here it is, here is the aughts on Harmony's body, you know?
Kristin: Totally, it's like you're wearing makeup but are you? That's the early aughts, the very nude lipstick and you're kinda dewy. [laughs] Drew Barrymore I think, pulled it off really well in the early aughts. I think Drew Barrymore was a high contender for that dewy look.
Joanna: Yes. Dewy Barrymore, that was her- sorry.
Kristin: Dewy. Fucking Barrymore. Great, great, great.
Joanna: Yeah, so they have the fight outside but it should be noted that in order to get to that Spike just runs. Like just runs out of that party you know, classic I'm gonna start talking about something else and then no I'm just gonna throw this passed out teenager at you. [both laugh]
Kristin: Yeah, It's good. I'm here for it. Soooo… we go to a scene in Xander's room where we finally find out why he's squeezing the juice box in the credits.
Joanna: [laughs] It's a great little metaphor. Good ole sqeezin' the juice box. Yeah, and it should be noted that Xander is decorating his room with a disco ball, just fyi, brightening up that basement room with a disco ball so that's our Xander.
Kristin: [laughs] Oh, that is our Xander.
Joanna: I actually- I know you guys get some guff from your listeners for being too hard on Xander. I am certainly, often, very hard on Xander. I have a lot of soft, sympathetic feelings for Xander in this episode, to be honest with you.
Kristin: Yeah, same.
Joanna: So, his first time was terrible with Faith.
Kristin:[agrees]
Joanna: And just as someone who doesn't know what to do but probably genuinely does have good intentions, at least in this context, but just doesn't know what to do. That's my take on Xander in this whole sticky situation.
Kristin: Yeah, yeah he's- also, "sticky situation" I see you, I see youJoanna: Yup, mhm.
Kristin: But yeah he's really, he's trying to do right by himself too. Anya is being very clear about what she's after [laughs] so completely clear. Is she wearing nothing under that dress, right? That's what we're to believe? That she's just wearing that dress and there's zero things underneath it as it drops to the floor.
Joanna: Yeah and its, okay Im gonna- this is a sex episode so let's just talk about this- there's something even more naked about a woman who still has her shoes on, is that true?
Kristin: Oooh! Yes, yes.
Joanna: Yeah, she drops the dress but she still has on - I think they're platform wedges because it was 1999- like she still has her shoes on and that just feels more naked to me, so…
Kristin: I agree it's also- I mean it's pretty sexy. I wanna say that human beings and the way our desires work is really funny. Because like somebody standing in their heels with no clothes on is pretty sexy in my brain. Somebody standing in their socks with no clothes on, immediately not sexy [laughs] It's just like, change the fabric, change the texture, change the height and then we're in a totally different place, ya know? But, luckily, Anya was not just wearing socks, Anya was wearing some heels. [laughs]
Joanna: Yes. [laughs]
Kristin: But yeah, I mean, I think Xander has one Xander-y comment, which is as he's trying to explain his feelings about sexual intercourse and how he wants it to mean something and what have you, where he does, you know, hit the Xander bell and say "I'm actually turning into a woman as Isay this but-" which is a whomp whomp for Xander but its theJoanna: Not great.
Kristin: Not great but it's, I think, at least as far as I witnessed in this episode, it was really the only moment where I was like "okay, c'mon man, you're so close, you're so close to just nailing this thing". And by "nailing this thing" I mean like smashing the patriarchy, not Anya. [both laugh]
Joanna: No! I don't think anyone who knows you thought you meant Anya.
Kristin: Just, god forbid. [laughs] Let me be clear. So, in the middle of this, wonderful Xander/Anya scene, Giles and Buffy get on the phone. And it's really not super notable, it's just Giles is like "It's a myth, it's like the Holy Grail, it's not a real thing…" But I just wrote a little note, because everytime Giles gets super excited about history or a book, I enjoy it. And he just has this moment where he's reading the book and he realizes that it's the tenth century and he didn't know it was the tenth century and he's like "Oooh! The tenth century?" as he's reading the book which is a nice little book-y Giles moment, you know?
Joanna: I love you Giles. Also, well my note here is "Payphone!" cause I just get excited everytime someone uses a payphone. [laughs]
Kristin: Were payphones- so, I don't remember our exact age difference, but are you somebody who has used payphones in your life?
Joanna: [laughs] Yes, I've used a payphone in my life, yes.
Kristin: Was it a part of your- payphones were a very large part of my existence, especially in New York because I remember being very upset anytime I had to use a payphone in New York because I always felt like it was covered in the worst things in the universe and so I would try to hear in the thing and talk in the thing without them touching my skin, you know?
NOTES: [laughs]
Joanna: Yes, and you always had to have change and it was like a whole thing of a pursuit of change if you needed to contact someone and also, you know, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, one of the most iconic lines is "If the apocalypse comes, beep me" so you have your like pager, someone pages you, and then you have to go find a payphone and call them. But payphones are not so far in the distant past that your younger listeners won't know what they are, especially if they listen to Serial, the podcast where payphones played a big role. But, eventually payphones will become one of those things where its like watching a movie and someone's like "Operator Klondike 555" you know, like what is this weird way we used to communicate? [both laugh]
Kristin: Oh, wow. It's so true.
Joanna: Yeah, so you see a payphone and you just sort of "oh…" and they're almost all gone now and there's a slight classism to that you know what I mean? cause a phone call, brace yourself, used to cost a dime. But people who couldn't- I guess a lot of people could afford a cell phone but not everyone could afford a cell phone. And so the fact that pay phones have been all but removed from the streets means that a population that can't access telecommunication that way is kind of cut off from it and that's something I think about, that's just a little bummer I thought I'd drop in the middle of this episode so…
Kristin: Yeah, no I'm here, I'm here for the bummers because it's true. It's like pay phones were accessible to anyone with a quarter. You just needed a quarter and then you could make a call. They were universally accessible and cell phones are of course not, not at all.
Joanna: So that's your pay phone detour, back to Anya and Xander. [laughs] Or whatever comes next.
Kristin: Another relic of the 90s, well that's a very rude way of referring to Antonio Banderas but I just- [laughs] But like… you know… Antonio…
Joanna: Usually I can see your transitions coming, I didn't see it coming for Antonio, you got me. I didn't see it coming for poor Antonio.
Kristin: Oh, I'm so proud.
Joanna: I didn't see the mack truck bearing down on poor Antonio. It should be noted, so Harmony looking beautiful in a negligee.
Kristin: So gorgeous.
Joanna: And luxuriating in bed reading a tabloid is bothering Spike right? But it should be noted that when she brings up Antonio in this context he of course did play a vampire, Interview with the Vampire in 1994 and this is 1999 so you know…
Kristin: Yeeeeeeees.
Joanna: I guess she could have said Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt but she went international, she went with Antonio. [both laugh]
Kristin: And also Antonio Banderas was doing a great job in the world but in the fucking 90s all you heard about was Antonio Banderas. He was everywhere.
Joanna: It was a big deal. Big, big deal.
Kristin: Yeah, he was a very fucking big deal and this scene we get some Spike sex and I'm here for it. I'm here for the Spike sex and I'm also here for Harmony using her blue veins as a- like that's how she's getting Spike. She says literally "I'm simply covered in these blue veins". [laughs] and I just…
Joanna: Oh my god.
Kristin: I like it. I like what I like and I like this.
Joanna: Yeah, the blue veins and more Drusilla talk.
Kristin: Right! yes, what does she call her?
Joanna: Dorkus? [both laugh] So Dorkus is something that we called each other in the 80s and 90s right and it was like a rad, totally tubular, dorkus sort of thing. For your listeners who are musical fans there's a musical that I grew up watching a million times over which is problematic in it's own right, seven brides for seven brothers, it was like a favorite in my house. The most beautiful sex potty character in that musical, played by Julie Newmar, who also played Catwoman, is named Dorcus [laughs] that's her name. They're like pioneer women, like frontier women, and so Dorcus, I guess, was a name that one might be named at that time and it's like D-o-r-c-u-s.
Kristin: [laughs] Oh my God
Joanna: And long before "dork" was a thing we ever called people and so, they're like "Dorcus!" at this like sex bomb of a woman, it's so funny.
Kristin: Wow, I need to watch that musical. I'm not familiar with that musical, actually, and I would like to turn "Dorkus" on its head and it feels like this will really do it for me. [laughs]
Joanna: Yeah, Julie Newmar is taking "dorkus" back. She's reclaiming it, she's sexifiying it, it's gonna be great. [both laugh]
Kristin: Incredible!

NOTES: [ad break music ends]
Kristin: So, then we have to go back to this fucking party, right, thats where we're going? And Biff Naked is serenading them and she's all like "we are the lucky ones" and everybody's like "Yeah, the 90's!" and then Parker and Buffy steal away to have this- my note, specifically, is "Parkers all 'la la la history is whatever, making a choice…'" It's just like I can't hear anything that he says now and not just wanna strangle him.
Joanna: Yeah.
Kristin: But I will say that I really find this kiss to be A+, as much as I'm like "ugh parker stop saying all your bullshit just to makeout", the kiss is a really good kiss!
Joanna: You know who's really good at slow dancing and then like nuzzling and then smooching someone? Sarah Michelle Gellar.
Kristin: Yeah.
Joanna: She does it real well. You feel like- she does the whole: in that sort of attraction-daze thing, really well. I feel like you just really are transported when SMG is telling you that Buffy is sexually attracted to someone. I think she's good at it! [both laugh]
Kristin: Yeah, she is, she is.
Joanna: Here's what's true about Parker, here's what's both good and badabout Parker: Yeah, Parker is running a game on her. Yeah, Parker is a total trash human. But he is also in his like sneaky, shitty way, setting up expectations, you know what I mean? You can disagree with me, that's fine. But here's what I will say, from my own perspective. Having lived more life than 18 year old Buffy had at this time, there's a point where you start to recognize when people say those things to you, and you're like "Oh, I understand what that means" you know what I mean? "This person is, in their shitty way, trying to set up some expectations for me, testing the waters". And Buffy doesn't know that that's what he's doing, among other things that he's doing, you know what I mean? And so she just agrees with him. And she's like "Yes! Live for today, no regrets, okay let's just do it, whatever". So yeah, maybe I'm giving him too much credit, but I'm just saying, it's a coding that eventually became able to read and when you're 18, you can't necessarily read that code, you know?
Kristin: Right, that's interesting because I feel like it's easy to watch now and see those things but I, in watching this, even this last viewing, I still felt like Parker was not- I felt like Parker was the kind of person who finds what works on a girl and then goes with it. And so it seemed to me more so that he was just like "This girl is really into being deep and whatever and like talking about this stuff" and so went hard in that direction? But I guess you're right, it makes me feel upset because at the end I really felt like he was super gaslight-y to Buffy and this would undo my gaslight-y theory.
Joanna: Listen, he is gaslighting her, absolutely. Of course he is, so maybe I just need to reframe this. I do not want to try to redeem Parker in any way, I will just say that he's both gaslighting her and, I guess, giving himself plausible deniability while hes gaslighting her, of like "We talked about this" you know what I mean?
Kristin: Yeah.
Joanna: And it's shitty and it sucks and I'm not defending him in any way, so please don't anyone misunderstand me. But I just think that- well, here'swhat I'll say: To your listeners both old and young [both laugh] If a dude or a lady comes up to you and starts talking about "living for today blah blah" And you have thoughts about maybe something more with them, cause that's fine, one night stands are fine, there's nothing wrong with that- But if you've thought something more, and they say something like that, just go, walk away, just don't mess with people who talk like that, if you want more, you know what I mean? Which is what Buffy is expecting, so.
Kristin: Totally, totally. Also I wanna shout out- cause this scene, they have this really great kiss and then it immediately cuts to Parkers dorm room, where there's this- Buffy's awkwardly taking off his jacket, it just seemed awkward, cause the kiss was so good. I was like "What's happening now?" Why didn't we choose a shirt? Why did we choose the weird, large jacket item to take off? But there's also some Angel lighting on the back- some venetian blind lighting right behind Parker's head, which I was like "Oh got some Angel lighting on the new boyfriend, I get it."
Joanna: Since you and I were definitely on this podcast together talking about Buffy's first time I just wanna note some things that are here and some things that are missing, okay? I don't have any clattering [both laugh] I don't have any tattoos, I don't have any swinging lights above casting things in and out of shadow. What I do have is Buffy clutching shoulder meat, that's a classic Buff move. Yeah, sorry if that was too graphic, and then the same exact sheets.
Kristin: Oh my god, oh my god.
Joanna: A thousand percent the same burgundy sheets that Angel had, so…
Kristin: Good calls.
Joanna: Angel's might have had a little bit more of a sheen on them, seems like Angel might have a little sateen or silk in with his sheets and Parker is a basic bitch cotton but it's the same burgundy sheets.
Kristin: I'm glad- see this is why I have it talking to you about Buffy is because you said same sheets and in my mind I thought when I'm gonna talk next I'm gonna be like well Joanna actually they were a little more sateen, a little shinier for Angel and then you just said it, you know what I mean, you just know. You know all the things that are in my brain and I'm appreciative of it.
Joanna: I should- I need to- sorry, I need to correct my own thing cause I just did google image search this cause I'm like oh man Kristin's listeners are going to get mad with me if I'm wrong. Angel has a blanket, there's white sheets but a crimson blanket sort of thing so I take it back but it definitely- when they're having sex it's like the crimson blanket is part of the whole visual- just if you were angrily typing an email right now you could stop. [both laugh]
Kristin: Thank you for being so thorough, I was with you, I remembered the crimson but I see.
Joanna: The crimson! It's a whole thing, yeah.
Kristin: So, my last note in this scene is Giles leaves a voicemail and because oh god the ring of Amara is real but too bad dad because Buffy's fucking Parker! [laughs]
Joanna: Did you say "too bad dad?". [laughs]
Kristin: Yeah, Dad you can't reach Buffy, she's having sex. She's not in her room which is, not to skip ahead, but Buffy walking into her fucking dorm room with Giles there and doing the full walk of shame with literal dad sitting there is a really, really great moment in this episode.
Joanna: Well but also bravo for Willow for ushering him out of there because she wants to talk about it with Buffy and we don't get a repeat of Becoming where Giles needs to know that Buffy was having sex. I think dad doesn't know this time which makes me happy.
Kristin: You think? I feel like he did.
Joanna: You think dad knows?
Kristin: I think dad knows cause there's a moment, I can't remember the exact line but there's a moment between Giles and Buffy where she's sort of saying well I don't even need to say where I was cause I'm in college and he's like thank goodness that you don't. You know what I mean?
Joanna: Oh, yeah okay, you're right, dad knows.
Kristin: Dad knows that it's better for dad not to know. Ohhh… so what else do we have here? There's whatever- Parker's dorm, Buffy's looking for her clothes, Parker brought coffee, whatever. I don't have any feelings about this particular exchange but it's there for you Joanna if you have feelings.
Joanna: Well, it's an interesting fake out, right? Because she wakes up the next morning, he's gone, she does that awkward sheet around you hunt for clothes sort of thing. Oh and so if you're watching this for the first time maybe you're like oh, well he's done that thing where the gent abandons the lady and she's just like "oh fuck, this sucks" you know and then he comes back with coffee and he's like "oh what I was just getting coffee" I mean it's further shittiness from Parker because he's playing the nice guy the next morning and it's just like get to the cad already, don't make us wait for the cad just go for it you know what I mean? So…
Kristin: Right, agree agree and there's also trouble in paradise between Anya and Xander in the next little tiny scene. It's sort of like there's these three, they stagger these scenes just like we get at the end with the three of them where they stagger these scenes. Where it's like Parker brings coffee to Buffy, then we go right to Xander's room and Anya's like "I'm over you now" and Xander says "Okay" and then she's like "Okay?!" flips out. And then it cuts right to Harmony riding on Spikes back, it's sort of like in the moment after right, it's like everybody has fucked and what are they all doing? What are the moments?
Joanna: Yeah, what's the post-coital? And the answer is nothing's good. With Anya and Xander once again I just have a lot of sympathy for Anya and I have a lot of sympathy for Xander cause I've been Anya, definitely often been Anya where you say something and you know she says "I'm definitely over you" and what she wants him to say is like "No, we had sex it was great, let's date" you know? And he's like "okay" and she's like "okay?!" you know and Xander who's 18 and not quick on the uptake generally anyway is not attuned yet to know that when sometimes people say things they don't mean in a weird plaintive way hoping for you to reassure them that they're wrong and he just sort of goes "okay…" and I have sympathy for both of them in that scene.
Kristin: Totally and Xander's definitely- I feel like Xander's been in this position before where he just goes along with it. He's not even really saying his own thoughts, he's just like I guess… she's saying this so I'm just gonna agree. He's definitely not participating in the exchange he's just agreeing cause he thinks it's what he's supposed to do.
Joanna: Yeah.
Kristin: So he's obviously taken super off guard when his agreement is not the thing to do at all.
Joanna: Yeah, and then Harmony using a lipstick shade that she would never wear or pull off. Practically black, I guess she's probably experimenting with some shades as a vampire.
Kristin: She's bored in that underground…
Joanna: Yeah, she writes "Spike loves Harmony" in a heart.
Kristin: Yes.
Joanna: Oh dear, oh Harm.
Kristin: Oh Harmony. Right and then the walk of shame happens. We already talked about that but I do wanna just say that in the scene that Buffy comes back to her dorm room she has some really good post-sex hair. I don't know if anybody else noticed it but it's real good.
Joanna: [laughs] But Kristin did!
Kristin: I did, I should have my own segment this season that's just Buffy's hair watch cause I'm really all about it. I think season four Buffy hair is super solid. At least these beginning episodes. I don't know where we're gonna go.
Joanna: I'm gonna do this thing where I know what you know and then your audience does. There's some crazy good/bad Buffy hair coming up that we can all talk about later.
Kristin: Ooooh, I think I know what you mean.
Joanna: But yeah, so the walk of shame that you talked about and then there's this upsetting Spike and Harmony scene, right?
Kristin: Yeah, so this starts off, before we get upset, this scene- the one that you're referencing I believe, begins with Harmony in a purple corset. It's a beautiful silk corset that she looks so good in and so before we go into this scene that gets a little down I think we should go to Kate Leth who I know is gonna have something to say about this purple corset. And probably many other Harmony looks, we'll see, we'll find out. But let's hear from Kate.
[Buffy Fashion Watch intro jingle plays: It's time for our friend Kate, To give you the Buffy Fashion Update!]
Kate: Well welcome back to Buffy Fashion Watch and today we're talking about The Harsh Light of Day aka all men are terrible but even demons and vampires pale in comparison to the guys you first meet in university. I'll be honest, I fast forwarded through a lot of this episode because I just… hate Parker so much. I'll start by saying Harmony overshadows everyone else in this episode to such a degree that Spike wouldn't even need the gem of amara if he'd just stand in the shade of her perfect outfits. We've got a red silk pantsuit, we've got detached sleeves with a braid in her hair no less. And the floor length pink silk skirt, and yes Kristin, we have a purple corset but it's not just a purple corset. It's a lavender tie front knit corset spaghetti strap top. There's so many words going on in there, it's really hard to cover all of it. And to top it all off I can't tell if the pants she's wearing with it are silk or pvc. Honestly I had that problem more than once in the episode. It's a problem I'm willing to have. I think we can agree on one thing, Spike never deserved her. Speaking of Spike, he'll make one of two guy entries into fashion watch this week, I know very unusual. And no it's not Xander, I'm not even talking about Xander in this episode even though he does have a couple moments to kind of not be horrible, it's weird. But hilariously Spike makes it in for a faux pas, I'm sorry, I have such complicated sexy feelings about Spike because he imprinted on me as a teen and it's really hard to make that go away. It is hilarious to see him in a baggy faded black t-shirt tucked into his jeans. He looks so goofy, what is he doing? The second entry is Giles. Giles wears a hoodie, that's all I have to say. Overall the scooby gang don't pull many fashion surprises in this episode although we do get the reintroduction of Anya. She wears several silk slip dresses, try and imagine how many takes I did on that one. And she has brown hair! I forgot about her brown hair, spoilers! Oh and don't worry if you were waiting for me to mention Buffy wearing baby blue when she kicks Spike's ass I didn't forget. I could never forget, she did that one for me. Until next time, I'll see you at the mall.
[Buffy Fashion Watch outro jingle plays: That was our friend Kate She gave you the Buffy Fashion Update]
Kristin: Oh my gosh.
Joanna: [laughs] You can always count on Kate, right?
Kristin: Always, literally always. So okay, thank you Kate, thank you for all the things that you constantly do to bring us fashion in all of the most inventive ways. Joanna now you wanna bring us down right? Let's all come down together.
Joanna: Well it's just an interesting scene because we love Harmony but we don't like Harmony, she's so shitty to everyone but when she says basically "why can't you be nice to me?" It's sort of like oh my gosh.
Kristin: She doesn't even say- she says "I don't know why I let you be so mean to me".
Joanna: Oooooh my god, it's so bad. It's so hard.
Kristin: It's really- I know, and again journeying through my feelings for Spike I was sort of like yeah Harmony, why do we do this? Why are we doing this? And of course Spike in another- I don't know how to exactly play your Shakespeare game but I just feel like "love hurts baby" might count, Idon't know if it counts but it seems likeJoanna: I'm gonna give it a half point for "love hurts baby". [both laugh]
Kristin: Thank you.
Joanna: Cause if you went out on the street right now and you were like "what do you think the line 'love hurts baby' is from?" people are gonna belike: all of pop music history? But if you say: what's 'blonde bear' from?
NOTES: [laughs]
Kristin: Okay, okay I'm learning Joanna. I'm learning your game.
Joanna: Yeah, learn to play this very important game.
Kristin: So then we go into a montage right? This is where we transition into a montage after sad Harmony?
Joanna: [sings] Detective Buffy… is using her yearbook to try to find Harmony. [laughs]
Kristin: She is, she is like: have you seen this girl? Also the yearbookpicture is the size of her thumbnail, so small. So she's like: have you seen this girl? And then it cuts to the drilling and the drilling and more drilling and then of course the other piece of this montage is no messages from Parker, no phone call from Parker. Buffy watching the phone, it's not ringing and she's getting more and more distressed in her pigtails.
Joanna: Distressed in her pigtails! Buffy Summers.
Kristin: Okay so then we get to the scene where- this reminded me of The Goonies, when they find the treasure in The Goonies. You know? Cause it's like piles of necklaces and jewels. Harmony is dancing in the back like an idiot in her little tiara. [She] has a great line where Spike thinks that the green jeweled necklace is the jewel of Amara and so he yanks it out of the pile and Harmony just says "like you're too good to use a clasp" [both laugh] She's so mad at him, that he yanked the necklace and didn't undo the clasp. You know Jane Espenson, fucking great, the lines are so good in this episode.
Joanna: Zingers. Yeah, this reminds me of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade right? Goonies is a good reference, I always like to remember that the Goonies call the treasure "rich stuff". Yeah, so they definitely find the rich stuff but also this is like the cave in the last crusade where you're looking for the magical thing among all the other things. And Spike is going for a bunch of super obvious stuff and Harmony has unwittingly put the ring on her finger so…
Kristin: Right, which we find out when Spike literally stakes Harmony having no idea that she's put on the jewel of Amara. Definitely just killed
Harmony and happened toJoanna: [sighs] Aw, Harm.
Kristin: I know, and she's so hurt. At first she has a perfectly Cordette response which is like "I can't believe you did that! Wha the fuck!" but deep down she's so hurt, my note is Spike why must you be like this? Why? It's no good.
Joanna: Why do we let you be so mean to Harmony? Yeah.
Kristin: Yes, and to us! Why do we allow it? [sighs] So now… now we go to Giles' apartment.
Joanna: Yes, and more great Xander stuff. [laughs] Xander moving books and finding Giles' tv and he's like "look he's shallow like us!" and Willow is so disappointed and Giles defends his tv by saying he watches public television and it's great.
Kristin: Classic librarian retort. Also this is the scene where- I don't even remember exactly what the dialogue is right at the top but they're talking about how this is very important, what they're doing, it's more important than records and Oz holds up a record, which I paused to figure out what it was, cause he's like even more important than this record? And it's The Velvet Underground, Loaded which I learned is the forth album from The Velvet and it's also the final album ever recorded by Lou Reed so…
Joanna: Oh wow.
Kristin: It is a pretty important album by my Wikipedia research. [laughs] Just so everyone knows.
Joanna: Yeah, well so Jane Espenson is so good with the zingers but also this is just good characterization right? This is a callback to Band Candy. There have been a number of moments I think about Giles' record collection and Oz's admiration for it.
Kristin: I knowJoanna: Just like that and so… yeah.
Kristin: It's real cute, they're just like little music heads together you know?
Joanna: I would listen to their podcast. [both laugh]
Kristin: Same, I would listen to Oz and Giles or Anthony Stewart Head and Seth Green, either way I'm good.
Joanna: Vinyl Corner with Oz and Giles, I would listen to it.
Kristin: Oh my god, it's so good. Now I wanna hire two actors to play Oz and Giles talking about the music and the series. Okay great, great, great. Okay then everything gets really shitty, this is when I get super caps lock for everything going on with Parker.
Joanna: Yeah, Buffy finds Parker using the same lines on another girl. Katie Lion I think?
Kristin: Yeah, I called her "smug Kaite" in my notes.
Joanna: Aww, is it Kaite's fault really? no.
Kristin: No, it's not Kaite's fault but the way she looks at Buffy is like [smug] Mm-hm.
Joanna: It's like you'll be next Kaite.
Kristin: Yeah, look out.
Joanna: You're looking at your future my girl. Katie and Parker bumming Buffy out, it's real bad and then it culminates. This is Buffy the Vampire Slayer right? Something real happens to you, this guy you slept with who you thought maybe you were gonna start something with. You find out he's a cad, he's hitting on smug Kaite and then a literal demon comes when you least suspect it and you have to fight with your demon. You know what I mean?
Kristin: Yesssss.
Joanna: That's what this show is and Spike punches her in the face. Spike is a daywalker now to use some Blade terminology and punches her in the face right when she least needs it.
Kristin: [sighs] Right when she least needs it because fucking- listen, I wanna talk about the fight with Spike too but I just wanna say out loud a couple of these lines from fucking Parker. One of the lines that Parker says to her before Spike gets there is- she's like "you didn't call and I was just wondering… " and he just fucking knows. He knows what the fuck is happening here but instead of being nice at all he says "It's only been a couple of days, did you need to talk about something?" like a fucking nightmare and then Buffy halfway through this conversation is like "did I do something wrong?" Which made me wanna sob, just sob because she thinks that she's done something wrong and it just makes me so upset and Joanna it is one of the most visceral experiences of the fucking patriarchy that I have seen so far in this show. It makes me so mad so I'm just gonna play the fucking jingle.
NOTES: [The Patriarchy jingle plays]
Kristin: Okay, so thank you for bearing with my anger that I have and now Spike has punched and we're in the daylight fight. [laughs]
Joanna: Yes, sorry I did not mean to railroad any opportunity to call out the patriarchy but you know here's Spike also doing it because Spike is not only literally punching Buffy but he's slut shaming her in this fight too and once again we apologize for Spike being our favorite, he is our favorite, this is terrible. The most charitable explanation I can come up with- not that I need to defend Spike cause he is a villain. But he's once again my whole rom-com will they/won't they. His fixation with who Buffy is having sex with and he says this disgusting thing where he's like "what's it like to pry apart the Slayer's dimpled knees" or something like that. That's disgusting because 'dimpled knees' implies super young and all of that, it's just disgusting. But I'm just sort of like… because he wants to. [tough voice] That's not an excuse! That's my thesis so you know.
Kristin: Yeah… and also it is complicated that we talk so much about smashing the patriarchy and yet here I am and here you are and we're like oh fuck but Spike! Cause it's like what the fuck? You know, he is the worst but he's also a demon and so I think that influences my experience of Spike cause he's written to be evil. The shit he does is fucking evil and it falls a little bit differently to me than Parker being a shitbag. They both really could use a good fucking punch in the face in this episode but I think that's why perhaps I interalize them differently. I don't know, but I do.
Joanna: Oh absolutely, I think a shitty human is magnitudes worse than a villain who's as evil as he's supposed to be. And this whole exchange and him bringing up Angel and him bringing up Angel being the thing that sort of drives her to finish the fight. That's all great because fuck him and fuck him for bringing that up but then he's also had Drusilla thrown in his face a number of times in this epiosde so this ex-slinging as you mentioned at the top of the episode is sort of a two way street.
Kristin: Totally.
Joanna: But Spike is just more disgusting and shitty and slut-shamy about it cause he talks about her having sex with Parker and he's like oh didn't seem like you knew him that well, it's like fuck you dude, come on.
Kristin: Yeah, well right and he's just playing on- I mean they do a good job playing on each other's insecurities because his insecurity is his heart when it comes to Dru and in this case Buffy's insecurity really is tied to having sex and feeling like did she fuck up? were her expectations wrong? What did she do wrong when it comes to sleeping with this person because it's a fucking trigger for her already because of her history. So they really know how to fuck each other up [laughs] is what I think we are saying. Also shout out to another line "gem of Amara, official sponsor of my killing you" I think is pretty solid, nice work Jane and Spike. [laughs]
Joanna: Great, great, great. There's also- we should point out, some truly classically terrible stunt work in this scene. And then some good stuff too, I rewound this one part where Spike's on his back and he does one of those classic flip himself back up things that you see so often on Buffy and I swear to god it's Marster's doing it because you can see his face. It's not a cut to his face, he flips himself up and it's on his face and granted his Spike vamp makeup in the daytime… the thing is the stunt double is physically a bigger dude and so it's not the stunt double. Maybe they had an acrobatic double but it seems like too much work. So anyway, I'll be curious if your listeners agree with me or if they're like Joanna you're crazy James Marsters definitely did not do a flip back up from the ground.
Kristin: Oh but what if he did? I'm fanning myself.
Joanna: He had many abs at the time and I think Sarah did that move herself a couple times as well. I think it's one that the actors could figure out. They're not necessarily doing their own kicking but they're doing that flip up from the ground.
Kristin: So [sighs] the turn that Spike takes to Angel is really all Buffy ever needed to win this fight. As soon as he draws the line between the insecurity she's feeling with Parker to the experience she had with Angel it's fucking done! My note in all caps is "THAT'S ALL SHE NEEDED, BLAMO" literally I wrote "BLAMO" so you're all welcome.
Joanna: Wow.
Kristin: She gets the fucking ring, Spike somehow doesn't immediately combust which is a little… He jumps underground pretty quickly but he's in direct sunlight for at least a couple seconds. No fire happens, he jumps underground. Will it be the last we see of Spike? Well he's in the credits folks so probably not. But yeah and then the end of this episode has a lot of feelings for me. What about you Joanna?
Joanna: Well yeah, and before we get to the very end we should say that we skipped Anya looking for Xander and Xander was looking for Buffy and he's like I don't have time and he didn't. They know I think at that point that Spike- or maybe he doesn't know that, anyway this is not the first or the last time that Xander's concern for Buffy will supercede concern for a romantic partner. This is a classic Xander thing but it also sort of feels like yeah, he doesn't have time in that moment for that. But that's a sad thing for Anya and then also we get Harmony who goes "being a vampire sucks!" and it's such a cheesy line but its done so well. Yeah, full marks for that.
Kristin: Yeah it really is, sad vamp Harmony really nails it. I wrote down another one of her lines in that little moment cause she says "like I wouldn't have just given it to him, he was my platinum baby and I loved him". Aww Harm!
Joanna: [laughs] Why is she so good?
Kristin: The episode would have ended wonderfully if all the scorned women just got together. If they were like you know what ladies? Let's just be here for each other. That's how Kristin Russo would have ended this episode.
Joanna: Are you saying you wanted Ocean's 3 at the end of this episode?
NOTES: [both laugh]
Kristin: Yes. Correct.
Joanna: Yeah, but instead it's just sad walking montage
Kristin: Right, but of course we get to the sad walking montage thankfully Oz has that gig in Los Angeles that we briefly heard about at the beginning of the episode so he's gonna bring the ring of Amara to Angel from Buffy which is like…
Joanna: Kristin, I really wish that you were doing an Angel podcast right now because then you could just immediately the following week go to thatepisode where
Kristin: Well you know, you're right and what's funny Joanna is I am.
Joanna: What! This is the first I'm hearing of it. [laughs]
Kristin: There actually is an Angel podcast, it's called Angel on Top and you know who's gonna be guesting on this episode? The next episode is Jenny Owen Youngs.
Joanna: Who's that? [gasps] I've heard of her!
Kristin: Yeah, Jenny Owen Youngs who is not here in this universe, don't worry will be in Los Angeles in the other universe because we're gonna find out what happens over there with Oz going to LA cause you know… that's what these television shows do. [sighs] It's so exciting.
Joanna: Yeah, I am really thrilled that you guys are doing this week by week thing. I've never done that kind of watch. The watch one Buffy, watch one Angel but especially in this season and the following one, they're on the same network, it feels vital to do a side by side watch. You just miss things if you don't so I would recommend everyone it's early in the new Angel podcast start your Angel rewatch or your Angel first time watch. Kristin didnot pay me to say this nor did she tell me to say this
Kristin: [laughs] I didn't!
Joanna: But I really do think that it's at least for two seasons and then you'll be hooked and won't wanna stop anyway but at least for two seasons you gotta watch both.
Kristin: Hell yeah, the crossovers are everything. So then Willow really shows the fuck up. Willow says the thing that we all wanted to scream to Buffy through the television screen in the prior scene. You don't know, none of this bullshit where you feel like you did something wrong this guy is an asshole but in Willow speak is a poop head. [laughs] And Buffy sort of has this moment of saying like ugh! which really gets me. "He's manipulative and shallow and why doesn't he want me"
Joanna: Ahhh!
Kristin: Right? Owning this shit, being like I see it but yet it still emotionally impacts me. I can't access the next rung on this ladder to say he's manipulative and he's shallow and so I don't give a fuck that he doesn't want me, I'm still on this rung of the ladder where I'm still upset about it which is so real, it is. You can see that somebody's an asshole and still be destroyed by them, it's just how life is.
Joanna: Yeah, that's a very real sentence right there and so I will be gentle on Xander in this episode, I will be sympathetic for Harmony and Anya and hopefully as harsh on Spike as I should be. I'm gonna be a little hard on Buffy here, this is Willow showing the fuck up for Buffy in a way that I feel Buffy often fails to do for Willow. I think we've all been in those friendships where [laughs] you're the one who shows up but the other person doesn't. Not that Buffy never does but just every time Willow does in such a spectacular fashion I'm like [sigh] Buffy's not- she's the chosen one sure but I wish she would choose to show up for her friends a little bit more sometimes.
Kristin: Yeah, it's certainly an unbalanced relationship at least at this stage in the game. It's always Willow comforting Buffy very rarely Buffy being there for Willow in that deep a way. But hopefully she's taken some of what Willow has said to heart that this is a certifiable poop head and we don't need him anymore. And then we get our- did you call it a broken hearted walk? Cause if you did that's literally the note that I wrote down.
Joanna: Similar yeah, something like that.
Kristin: Buffy, Anya and Harmony just all like man… love hurts. What was the line that I said that I got a half a point for?
Joanna: "Love hurts baby". [both laugh]
Kristin: So generous with that half point.
Joanna: In the classic words of Buffy the Vampire Slayer "Love hurts baby"
Kristin: [laughs] God damn it! You know what's hard about a podcast is that it just goes into outer space and now forever that will be logged. "Love hurts baby" that's the one I came up with everyone. Well this is an episode entirely about sex and so of course let's go over to Jenny Owen Youngs and the sexual tension award for this week. [Sexual Tension Award jingle plays]
Jenny: Hey, what's up it's me your friend Jenny Owen Youngs here to bring you everything you need to know about recent goings on in the land of the sexual tension awards. Great, great, great. Last episode, season four episode two Living Conditions wanna bring the results of our listener poll to you.
Here's what we got: basically tied in last place we had Kathy and Celine Dion with 15% and Kathy and pencil sharpener with 14%. Coming in at second place we had Kathy and hard boiled eggs with 30% of the vote. And Kathy and Cher taking the award with 41% of your vote, hell yeah. Congratulations Kathy and Cher I guess Kathy was gonna come out a winner no matter what but very exciting for Cher I'm sure Cher has a small space just open and dusted on her trophy wall in her home just waiting for this trophy which is of course, in the mail. Thank you all for voting. You know I guess there were some real sparks between Kathy and Celine and Kathy and those eggs and Kathy and the pencil sharpener but when you really think about it we did hear "do you believe in life after love" more times in this episode than I think we've ever heard anything in one episode of anything ever before. So great. They've clearly earned it and we're very happy for them. Now, moving on to this episode's nominees. Now when Kristin and I were narrowing it down this week, I want you to know that I had a nomination for Drusilla and the fungus demon which we were categorizing as a special off camera nomination. Now, we're not gonna honor that, it's not gonna be in the twitter poll but we did wanna mention it cause it sounds great and alsowe wanted a chance to play the Drusilla jingle for you so here it is:
[Drusilla's jingle plays: Drusilla you filla my heart with dread And still I'm led right back to you]
Jenny: Okay, okay, okay so now time for the real nominees this week. Wow, okay we've got some hot, hot pairings. First of all we've got Devon and crop tops, I don't know if you noticed Devons midriff the way I noticed Devons midriff but holy crap that guy loves a crop top. We've also got Anya and the phrase "sexual intercourse" which she allegedly said like a dozen times, great, great, great. Then we've got Xander and his juicebox of course. And our final nominee is Harmony and Blondie Bear/Platinum Baby. So if you wanna get in on this please find us on twitter @bufferingcast we will have the poll up imminently and you can vote for your top pick for sexual tension in this week's episode. Care about you guys, now enjoy the rest of the episode. [Sexual Tension Award jingle plays]
Kristin: Oh my gosh, a huge congrats from us too to Cher and Kathy. Great work.
Joanna: Do you believe… Kristin that that was the results?
Kristin: [laughs] You know… Joanna I do, I do believe it. I also really believe that the second runner up was the hard boiled eggs cause I think they were really neck and neck for a while there and then Cher took the lead which I think was well deserved. So anyhow… did we miss anything? Did we miss anything towards the end of the episode that you wanted to talk about?
Joanna: I don't think so, I appreciate- I mean the thesis of Becoming part one and two is what if you sleep with your high school boyfriend or your much older boyfriend when you're in high school and he literally becomes a monster. You know is Joss's great brilliant stroke of genius that he had for Buffy season two. And to have it repeated again in human form in college- I don't know- here's what it feels like, it's like you go to high school and everything's so dramatic and everything's so big and it's over the top and this metaphor of these hurdles you face are literal demons it all makes so much sense because high school just feels that way, so big. To have it reflected and refracted again in Parker in college but be smaller and lamer and human is also a lesson you learn in college. Where you're just sort of like oh these problems that I thought were so big in high school maybe these happen all the time. Happens every day all the time and it's not that Buffy's hurt here isn't significant, it is. Not that this is the last we'll see of her hurt but that it's just like yeah this happens man. It's not just your special vampire demon boyfriend that does this shit, it just happens, people are terrible sometimes.
Kristin: Totally!
Joanna: These are the lessons we learn in college or as we get older.
Kristin: Totally, and I love that too because that's kind of the journey that we all go on as we grow. It's not that the things hurt any less, it's that they just hurt with a different level of knowledge, right? We have more to contextualize the hurt with and it's the same. The hurt that you feel when your first love leaves you, you feel that level of hurt so many other times in your life but it's just different because you're older. You have more experience in certain things, you have more trauma in certain ways. There's just all these other pieces that go along with it and so right this is devastating for Buffy in a way that is really very deep, maybe not as deep as sending her first lover to a hell dimension but it's real. It's very fucked up.
Joanna: Right and Buffy will continue to learn these lessons, this is the whole point of things and the challenge of the show and I think you and I did talk about this a little bit on the Living Conditions episode that we did is the challenge of the show is to find those parallels that are maybe easy to recall in high school but what does that look like in college. What does that look like beyond college, what are the young adult hurdles that feel demonic to us? Is it your freshman roommate using sharpie to label her eggs? Is it this thing that you thought was more than a one night stand and it turns out it was just a one night stand? What are those things? And I think I said in that episode sometimes these later seasons of Buffy really nail it and sometimes I think they're stretching a little bit to figure out analogous challenges for young adults. So I don't know, it's interesting.
Kristin: Joanna, you're so good at talking. Do you know that about yourself? [both laugh] Joanna Robinson [sighs] thanks for being a part of The Harsh Light of Day with me.
Joanna: Thank you for having me to talk about our problematic fave and weird sex stuff. Someday Kristin, you and I will launch our spinoff podcast that's just called Problematic Fave.
Kristin: Yeah, yeah.
Joanna: Parenthesis (weird sex stuff) Everyone will of course wanna listen to it.
Kristin: Exactly and if you all enjoyed listening to Joanna and I talk about The Harsh Light of Day, I said this up at the top but you can listen to us talk about Living Conditions in a bonus episode that's over on our Patreon which is available to all of our patrons at any level. So you can check that out, you just go to our website bufferingthevampireslayer.com and click on Patreon and there's a bonus episode where Joanna and I talk about Kathy, Kathy, and some more Kathy. [laughs] Joanna will you tell the lovely humans where they can find you?
Joanna: If you're a Westworld watcher and a podcast listener, hopefully for listening to this podcast, you are a podcast listener. I do two podcasts about the tv show Westworld, one is called- it takes that many podcasts to understand what's going on guys. One's called Decoding Westworld, one'scalled Still Watching: West World. Also the Still Watching podcast will once Westworld is done be moving on to the Amy Adams HBO adaptation of Gillian Flynn's Sharp Objects so we will be doing a little watch of that. So Still Watching is something that I do with my Vanity Fair co host Richard Lawson and if you don't wanna hear me yammer anymore you can read me yammer on vanityfair.com. I'm actually in newstands right now, I have a cover story in Vanity Fair so you can get that on newstands. The cover story on Emelia Clarke or you can find me on twitter @jowrotethis.
Kristin: [sighs] The cover story on Emelia Clarke, I just wanna make sure everyone heard that, it's so fucking awesome Joanna. So great. Everything that you do is so great, also want everyone to know that I'm behind on Westworld but Joanna I squintily looked at some of your tweets and I'm like oh Joanna's really into the most recent episode and I'm like three behind, I have to catch up. I have so much to watch!
Joanna: I was a little proud of myself, so I wrote this tweet that went a little far. Sometimes you make a tweet and it goes far outside the scope of your little following right? And so all the sudden there are people on there who don't understand what you're about and they're trying to decipher your tweet. I feel like most of the people who follow me really understood but I put the last episode of Westworld and compared it to three episodes of television that I find tremendously affecting. And one's The Door Game of Thrones episode, one is The Constant, my favorite Lost episode. And then I put a Buffy still up there and most people in my feed knew which one I meant but it's just Giles' face so a lot of people are like either what's Giles reacting to? Some people are like is that the coffee commercial that Giles used to be on?
Kristin: Oh my god.
Joanna: And then some people are just like what's that Buffy episode? It was Passion for the record, I know all of your listeners would have gotten it. It's the shot of Giles' face when he sees Jenny.
Kristin: It's very clear what it is Joanna, I'm here for you.
Joanna: Right? We get it! I just wanna say I needed more of listeners in that moment for all the people who were like what episode is that? I mean granted I could have picked Jenny and Angel in the window or something like that but I went for the Giles moment because it's just a little bit more you know?
Kristin: Yeah, I do. I think it was a great choice, screw all those people who don't know Buffy well enough to get your picture. I mean, come on.
Joanna: [laughs] Screw them.
Kristin: Anyhow when I am not talking to Jenny Owen Youngs or Joanna Robinson about Buffy the Vampire Slayer I am doing stuff with LGBTQ young people and their families. As a matter a fact if you are based in New York in just a few days on June 23rd I'll be doing my All Ages Pride Party. It's an annual party that I throw in New York City. It's at Housing Works Bookstore. It's super fun, it's from one o'clock until three o'clock and we have performances by Chica and Emily Wells and the Slam Poetry Team from Urban Word New York City, Reese Bernard of Autostraddle is gonna co host with me. You can find out all of those details just by following me on social media, it's all over my social media right now. You can do that @kristinnoeline which is k-r-i-s-t-i-n-n-o-e-l- did I spell my own name wrong? Did I say k-r-i-s-t-e-n or did I say i-n? I'm gonna start again, wow this is history in the making folks. [laughs] k-r-i-s-t-i-n-n-o-e-l-i-n-e, jesus christ. That's how you find my socials, it's also my website kristinnoeline.com. And of course you can find Buffering @bufferingcast on twitter, on instagram and on facebook. And you can also email us at bufferingthevampireslayer@gmail.com. I think we're ready to howl out Joanna, are you ready?
Joanna: I'm ready.
Kristin: Until next time…
Kristin and Joanna: Awwwoooooooooooooo!
Kristin: Beautiful. [Jenny performing "The Harsh Light of Day" from the album "Songs from Season Four" by Buffering the Vampire Slayer] I thought I knew what I was getting into Took a deep breath, leapt out of the window Looking for an updraft, updraft I didn't get to catch that, catch that Will it always feel like this Where it starts off with a kiss Then leaves me licking my wounds and thinking of you Way back before I ever saw your face I thought that love was something I should chase I thought it'd fade but what do I know I'm darker underneath your shadow Will it always feel like this Where it starts off with a kiss Then leaves me licking my wounds and thinking of you Wanna see the world without you but I don't know if I'm able The demon in my bedside table You left a mark on me that's feelin kinda fatal The demon in my bedside table Will it always feel like this Where it starts off with a kiss Then leaves me licking my wounds and thinking of you
