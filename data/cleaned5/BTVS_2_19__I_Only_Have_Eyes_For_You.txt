NOTES: [theme song]
Jenny: Hello! And welcome to yet another episode of Buffering the Vampire Slayer, a podcast where we are watching and discussing every episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer one at a time. My name is Jenny Owen Youngs.
Kristin: My name is Kristin Russo, and this week we are talking about season 2 episode 19, "I Only Have Eyes For You." Stay tuned at the end of this podcast every week for an original song written by us recapping the Buffy episode we are discussing.
Jenny: "I Only Have Eyes For You" was written by Marti Noxon and directed by James Whitmore Jr. and originally aired on April 28th, 1998.
Kristin: This is the one where Sunnydale High School is haunted by the ghost of a former student and teacher who reenact their tragic romance through the bodies of the school's current inhabitants.
Jenny: [soft laughter]
Kristin: I don't know, I didn't write it. The school's current inhabitants.
Jenny: Inhabitants.
Kristin: Inhabitants. Well, I mean, it's one way to put it.
Jenny: It is.
Kristin: Jenny?
Jenny: Yes?
Kristin: Do you wanna tell them? Or should I tell them?
Jenny: I'll tell them right now.
Kristin: That you tricked me.
Jenny: You… can't…
Kristin: Into having a Buffy the Vampire Slayer themed wedding.
Jenny: Well…
Kristin: Is what I learned this episode.
Jenny: Umm, Buffy the Vampire Slayer themed first dance.
Kristin: First dance, okay, fine.
Jenny: Our first dance was to The Flamingos recording of "I Only Have Eyes For You" which you hear twice in this episode.
Kristin: Twice but, we found a piece of information about the song.
Jenny: It's mysterious and this might be a poltergeist intervention or something [Kristin laughs] because these flashbacks happen in 1955 but The Flamingos didn't release their version of "I Only Have Eyes For You" until 1959.
Kristin: Maybe… maybe the initial memory was the original recording.
Jenny: [mmm in agreement]
Kristin: And then the ghost, the poltergeist, you know…
Jenny: The ghost was really into records… sure, sure.
Kristin: Heard the new version and just really needed a pick me up.
Jenny: Yeah, well, it is definitely the best version.
Kristin: You know what I would have picked? For my song?
Jenny: What's that?
Kristin: Any song by Frente, remember how Frente is sort of in this episode?
Jenny: Frente is kind of in this episode, in that Angie Harts' post-Frente band Splendid is performing on stage at The Bronze at the top of the episode.
Kristin: Which, like, blah-blah-blah… Frente!
Jenny: Ok! Yes.
Kristin: I'm sorry its just I only have an association with Frente, I love Frente, you love Frente.
Jenny: Love Frente.
Kristin: Most people who grew up in the 90s and who were alternative music fans. Remember alternative music? That was like a whole genre.
Jenny: Vaguely. It was… a thing.
Kristin: Is that even a genre anymore? Is that a real thing?
Jenny: It's unclear.
Kristin: Anyway… we loved Frente! If you don't know Frente, you know what, if you do know Frente, congratulations, I'm gonna play just two tiny clips. If you don't know Frente you should immediately go out… what was the name of the album with the fish on it?
Jenny: Uh that was Marvin the Album, but I personally really love Shape. Shape, her follow up.
Kristin: I don't know, I think I just had, I think I just had that one album, I don't know. I don't know anymore, but anyway, on that album there is a cover of "Bizarre Love Triangle" you might remember this. [Frente performing "Bizarre Love Triangle" off the album "Marvin the Album"] Every time I think of you I get a shot right through into a bolt of blue…
Kristin: Listen to her, you know, it's real [singing] "it's no problem of mine, but it's a problem I find".
Jenny: Oh boy.
Kristin: [singing] "Living the life that we have left behind" is that the lyrics?
Jenny: Yeah. You're very… you're dangerously close to it.
Kristin: [chuckling] Dangerously close is good for me.
Jenny: Well above your average.
Kristin: Anyway. We pan from Frente, or whatever, to Willow wearing an incredible rainbow sweater, and then pan up… really nice shot where Willow looks up and the camera follows Willow's gaze up to the rafters where Buffy is standing in her gold lame pants.
Jenny: [mmmm]
Kristin: We do not have Kate Leth here with us this week but, oh boy!
Jenny: It's a crying shame!
Kristin: It is a crying shame, I'm sure that Kate will have many thoughts on these gold pants. The theme of this entire episode is the Sadie Hawkins dance. Usually we make it more than like 2 seconds into the episode without talking about the fucking patriarchy.
Jenny: uh-huh
Kristin: We don't make it here, do we Jenny?
Jenny: We sure don't!
Kristin: Because this guy…
Jenny: [disapproving noise] ugggh
Kristin: Walks up to Buffy
Jenny: [said with disgust] Ben
Kristin: Is that his name? Ben?
Jenny: His name is Ben, he's wearing a paisley shirt and dress pants…
Kristin: [disapproving noise] ugggh
Jenny: For some reason.
Kristin: Despicable! [laughter]
Jenny: I mean…
Kristin: And he's like, [sarcastically] "mm don't you remember me from Algebra 2, you sat in the row next to me three chairs back." Creepo.
Jenny: Yeah yeah yeah.
Kristin: But fine, whatever, he's not an immediate creepo, I didn't think he was an immediate creepo but he like…
Jenny: It's not like he's been sketching her while she sleeps or anything.
Kristin: True! Solid point. But he walks up to her and he's like, "Hey I heard about this Sadie Hawkins dance and wondered if you wanted to ask me."
Jenny: uuuuggggghhhhhh
Kristin: I have a lot to unpack here.
Jenny: Okay…
Kristin: I wanna start there, 'cause the fuck man, the fuck are you doing?! You're supposed to… it's the one, the one time, we're gonna get there don't worry i'm not just gonna say blanketly this is the one time where girls get to ask boys to the dance and leave it there, I'm coming back. But it's the one time where the girls are supposed to ask the boys to the dance. And this ding dong
NOTES: [Jenny laughs] Comes up to her, at the thing, and basically asks her to the frickking dance like a ding dong… I'm so…
Jenny: Yeah, he's a real ding dong.
Kristin: He's a real ding dong. Ben. Ding dong. You know what else is a ding dong? The fucking Sadie Hawkins dance. I looked it up, right, because I was like who is this Sadie Hawkins? Like is Sadie Hawkins a feminist from yesteryear and that's like what's happening in this situation? Sadie Hawkins is not a real person, um sorry Sadie. The Sadie Hawkins dance is named after the Li'l Abner comic strip character Sadie Hawkins. In the strip Sadie Hawkins day fell on a given day in November, the unmarried women of Dogpatch got to chase the bachelors and quote "marry up" with the ones they caught.
Jenny: [exasperated] Lord…
Kristin: The event was introduced in a daily strip which ran on November 15th 1937, this is unlike traditional dances where the men chase the women, this empowers… I'm reading an article, I'm not, opining in case it wasn't clear. This empowers women to chase after what they want and not just wait for it to walk their way.
Jenny: Oh… dear.
Kristin: So this is complicated, 'cause I'll give it… I'll give it a kernel, a tiny kernel that's wrapped up inside of a mound of bullshit.
Jenny: [in agreement] mhmm.
Kristin: There's a little kernel of like, hey, women don't get to have autonomy over shit, like they've been positioned historically to just say yes or no or oftentimes not even given the option to say yes or no. So, let's give them this great opportunity and there is a kernel…
Jenny: A once in a lifetime chance…
Kristin: Right, there's a kernel of like, sure I'm all for women having more autonomy and the structure not just being that you know, men ask women things and women then say yes or no- like fine. But it's wrapped up in this total, heteronormative bullshit way where it's like, ooh we're empowering women and what is the power they get? To ask a man to take them to the dance. I immediately, after looking up where Sadie Hawkins came from and getting angry, thought I wonder if Autostraddle has ever written anything about Sadie Hawkins? I wanna hear what they have to say, and low and behold, none other than Riese Bernard, the CEO and Editor-in-Chief of Autostraddle, had written 4 years ago an article on an episode of "Glee" where they had a Sadie Hawkins dance, and I just wanna read just, first of all, if you've never read any of Riese Bernards recaps of episodes of anything…
Jenny: Yeah, they're pretty priceless.
Kristin: You will, you could spend the next couple of months of your life delighted to no end at the way that this girl recaps an episode. I'm just gonna pull out this, so apparently in this episode of "Glee" the Sadie Hawkins dance, the girls are going to sing to the boys to ask them to the dance. So, Riese says, "This is so empowering, I feel like the Statue of Liberty, maybe next week the girls can pick out their own wedding dresses and the week after that they can pick out new drapes. The possibilities are endless."
Jenny: Yeah and I mean, really sort of the structure… well it's just I'm wondering how we would go to the Sadie Hawkins dance?
Kristin: I don't… I don't know Jenny.
Jenny: We would be caught in an infinite feedback loop.
NOTES: [Kristin laughs]
Jenny: Of not being able to ask each other…
Kristin: No, of being able to ask someone but not each other because we would have to ask a boy.
Jenny: Yeah [gasp of realisation]
Kristin: So what if we asked a boy, what if I was like, "hey Steve, do you wanna ask Jenny if she will go with me to the Sadie Hawkins dance?"
Jenny: I don't think that…
Kristin: It doesn't work! Because you would have to ask…
Jenny: You're right.
Kristin: It doesn't work, we'd have to go as a thruple. We'd have to both ask the same boy and then ditch him. That'd be the only way.
Jenny: Alright.
Kristin: And you know what?
NOTES: [both laugh]
Jenny: What?!
Kristin: Just that, because Cordelia has a moment with the Sadie Hawkins dance and I just found it fucking fascinating and amazing and troubling all of the things, I mean it's Cordelia so of course. Cordelia's like, "I'm boycotting the dance because this is all wrong, it's out of order." And I find it, it's a troubling comment because in her opinion, in Cordelia's opinion the men should only ask the women, right, so it's like backwards.
Jenny: And the men should pay.
Kristin: And the men should pay. But also we know Cordelia's character and Cordelia's character is somebody who always takes what she wants, exactly the way she wants it and no other way, so there's just something very interesting because I feel, I feel troubled about the Sadie Hawkins dynamic. I don't think it's good, I think it's bad. I don't think it's the way to give women their autonomy. I think there are better ways and I feel…
Jenny: One day in the whole year!
Kristin: Right and I feel like Cordelia's like, "Yo the fucking system is like this and I'm doing fine." [laughter] Which is complicated because Cordeliahas a lot of power in different ways: she's a white woman; she's a wealthy white woman, fine. But I just, I guess what i'm trying to get at is I feel that we could do an entire episode on the Sadie Hawkins dance, the character of Cordelia, Kristin Russo's feelings, I could go on forever.
Jenny: Is it this episode?
Kristin: Yeah it's happening right now [laughs] there's a lot to talk about so I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna keep spielling but I… I have a lot of feelings about it and some of them were summed up by this fucking ding dong. So…
Jenny: This… ding dong.
Kristin: Ding dong asking Buffy to the dance when he's not even- of course.
Jenny: Ugh.
Kristin: The patriarchy.
Jenny: Uh huh.
Kristin: You have to say it.
Jenny: [shouting] The Patriarchy!
Kristin: [giggle] There it is!
Jenny: Bleurgh
NOTES: [laughter]
Kristin: So soon… so soon in an episode.
Jenny: Too soon.
Kristin: Anyhow. Probably more patriarchy right around the bend in this hallway scene.
Jenny: We see two teens fighting… aaahhhh we don't know yet what they're fighting about.
Kristin: Luckily Buffy has chosen to patrol in the high school tonight.
Jenny: Yeah, she left The Bronze to patrol and went right to the high school.
Kristin: Yeah did she forget a book or something? I dunno, anyway, good thing, good thing because here are these two teens and one of my favourite kinds of Sunnydale High School scenes, which is the hallway scene.
Jenny: So the camera can go…
Kristin: I love it.
Jenny: 360 degrees around the people.
Kristin: Yeah it's great it reminded me of the opening scene of "Welcome to the Hellmouth" with good old Darla.
Jenny: Darla!
Kristin: Same hallway, or at least the same general vibe. And then we get a gun. We get a gun, I don't like a gun in a Buffy episode but I do feel that this particular gun has a purpose, Jenny gave it a name.
Jenny: It's a polter-gun.
Kristin: A polter-gun because it just disappears, 'cause I was like where the… how does… why does the gun just disappear? And if the gun disappears why doesn't the bullet disappear?
Jenny: Hmm maybe the bullet…
Kristin: You know what the answer is.
Jenny: Maybe the bullet does disappear after it has penetrated.
Kristin: Ooh so its like
Jenny: Like that old riddle.
Kristin: What?
Jenny: That the answer, the answer is icicles.
Kristin: What? Oh [haha]. The way that Jenny loves to tell her riddles. She gives you the answer, you have to…
Jenny: Name that riddle!
Kristin: [laughter] "What is icicles?" Wow. Anyway the answer I think to why does the gun disappear and the bullet, it's just metaphydics, right.
Jenny: Metaphydics, ghost gun, polter-gun.
Kristin: Metaphydics. Also I have a bone to pick with Buffy here, she's in the school, she sees the teens, she probably doesn't think "hey there are some teens" because she too, herself, is a teen. She sees these peers and she sees one pull out a gun and her instinct, now she's great with vampires, she's great with even werewolves. She's great with all manner of demon but I just don't think that if a person is pointing a gun at somebody your first response should be to go [shouts] "Hey!". Like it just…
Jenny: Yeah, you say that but you find yourself in that position you might be surprised at how you react.
Kristin: Well no, I'm not saying that it's not a believable response I'm just saying I don't know that it is an effective response. [Jenny makes a noise to express understanding] Luckily these two characters are caught in a loop so it doesn't matter what Buffy does unless she physically interrupts them, but I think that if it were an actual thing happening right then, probably you don't want to startle the person with the gun.
Jenny: Bad idea.
Kristin: I just, right, but it works out, we get one of our first 90's referencesin this episode with the
Jenny: Oh yeah.
Kristin: "You just went O.J. on your girlfriend" bit.
Jenny: [drawn out] Yes.
Kristin: Which OJ was acquitted? Is that what actually happened, is that what you say when somebody's found not guilty?
Jenny: [in agreement] mhmm
Kristin: Ok, yeah '95, so this is enough years later
Jenny: Fresh
Kristin: Right but enough years for it to be like, in the canon of referencing it. So we get that and she also, Buffy, later in the episode talks about Doctor Laura.
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kristin: Yeah really. So Marti Noxon was like, ba-da-bing ba-da-boom.
Jenny: Wow is that what Marti Noxon was like?
Kristin: Well no because ba-da-bing ba-da-boom didn't come out until later.
Jenny: People weren't saying ba-da-bing ba-da-boom before The Sopranos?
Kristin: Well of course people were, I was probably saying ba-da-bing ba-da-boom in the 90's but I just meant The Sopranos wasn't out yet. Great talk.
Jenny: Ok, so then we go to Snyder's office where he's furiously looking for any possible way to blame anything and everything on Buffy.
Kristin: Such a delight to see Armin Shimerman again.
Jenny: Snyder!!
Kristin: Love a Principal Snyder moment, and we get a double Snyder here. Like a double Snyder punch with the "Buffy sit down in your seat, I have togo deal with" what does he call it? "A pathetic little vegan". The pathetic
Jenny: Billy. Billy the vegan.
Kristin: "The pathetic little no life vegan" [Jenny ahh's in the background]. Billy, who has… I would love to meet Billy.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Who's Billy? The vegan in 1998.
Jenny: Who's the vegan in 1998Kristin: Right? I didn't even know vegans existed in '98. I knew, I was a vegetarian in, I think I was a vegetarian already in 1998. I'm no longer a vegetarian but I think I was a vegetarian from like '98 to 2000? Somethinglike that. Ate a lot of tomato sandwiches
Jenny: Great.
Kristin: Anyway, then we get, Jenny, then we get in our next scene. So whatever, Snyder, yearbook-
Jenny: Yeah the haunted book falls off the shelf.
Kristin: The haunted book, but they don't really get, it's not really, Buffy justputs it back. She just puts it back because she's like
Jenny: Awwww because she's responsible, if only Principal Snyder had seen her put that book back, it might have earned her some points.
Kristin: But then we go to Willow!
Jenny: And we get some hell math.
NOTES: ["Hell Math" jingle] Hell Math
Jenny: Not just any hell math but like a hell math joke?
NOTES: [Clip of Willow speaking from the episode "I Only Have Eyes For You"] "For next time read the chapters on information grouping and binary coding. I bet you'll think coding is pretty cool, I mean, if you find two digit multi-stacked conversions and primary number clusters a big hoot. [laughter, school bell rings]"
Kristin: I can't retain what she said but it was great, I loved it, but you were very upset about this scenario.
Jenny: Well I'm concerned for the welfare of the children because I don'tthink it's appropriate that
Kristin: Wow. Classic line Jenny.
Jenny: Ah yes, what I'm always saying. I don't think it's appropriate when a member of the faculty dies to just expect a high school student to take over teaching the class. This is highly irregular.
Kristin: I mean I think, right, I think that it was cute when Jenny Calendar asked Willow to take over for like half a class, and like maybe fine, maybe one more class but it's been a while and Willow's just excelling at her new role as teacher and I feel like the Sunnydale parent teacher association members are probably not thrilled that this is what their tax dollars are paying for.
Jenny: You know what else Willow's doing? She is going through Ms. Calendar's effects and divvying them out.
Kristin: Yeah which I guess makes sense because Jenny Calendar doesn'treally have any family. You know, because her uncle died
Jenny: Uncle Enyos is gone.
Kristin: And that was pretty much it, so… so yeah, this is where things takea turn. Because I was, I was chuckling a whole bunch
Jenny: You were having a good time
Kristin: I was having a great time, having a hoot
Jenny: [sarcastically] mmm gun violence, what a hoot.
Kristin: [laughter] But I just… I just really enjoyed the Willow making a really funny joke about math. And then it turns so hard around the bend when Giles walks in and this is, you know a big part of this episode is us seeing now, we've gotten through this Freddy Krueger Jr. nonsense of the last episode and now we are really facing Giles' grief. And we see that through the whole episode and it starts with Willow saying, you know "I found this and I did this," and you can just see the pain in his eyes and he's so sad, and he takes the rose quartz and he walks away with itand then
Jenny: We hear the remembering Jenny theme.
Kristin: Yeah and I said to Jenny when we were watching this, how cool to be somebody who scores television or movies, but like especially television, because you have these themes that come back and they're so effective. Like, I was like, I feel… why am I crying? You know, like what is… and then it's just my brain has associated that melody with the sad… I mean it's a sad song but I don't think that it would have affected me so powerfully had I not, had my brain not made that connection earlier which is so fucking cool.
Brains are so cool
Jenny: Brains are bonkers.
Kristin: Music is so cool but sad, this is a sad scene. And then we go to Buffy.
Jenny: Buffy in class, falling asleep, dreaming a dream of class.
Kristin: Dreaming a dream, yeah she doesn't get far in space but does get far in time.
Jenny: HAH! She dreams of the same classroom in 1955 and that's whereshe sees James
Kristin: Right.
Jenny: A student
Kristin: Yes and your classic scenario here of teacher-student love.
Jenny: Right?
Kristin: Right! Because this is like a whole thing, I mean this is a real thing this happens all the time.
Jenny: Oh yeah?
Kristin: Yeah!
Jenny: Oh. yeah, no you're right.
Kristin: I mean it's constantly, I feel like every other week there's a headline about, you know, some teacher-student relationship and there's just a huge amount of conversation around what is and isn't appropriate. Of course most of the world landing in the camp of this is never appropriate, but then there's like, but what… because this episode really does not judge their love.
Jenny: No.
Kristin: Like, at all.
Jenny: Pretty neutral.
Kristin: It's super neutral. It's like the entire pivot point is that she's saying we can't do this and he's saying but you love me, and like the end result is that their love was so powerful that their ghosts stayed behind to resolve this horrible thing that happened because their love couldn't go forward and at no point do the writers of the show, or does anything in this show say to us that this love is wrong. It ends with them kissing and then going up into somewhere.
Jenny: Wow.
Kristin: Right?
Jenny: You are right.
Kristin: I am right. I am right. And I like that, I like to push boundaries, I like to really think about things, and I like to really challenge what is and what isn't appropriate.
Jenny: So classic move when you're hitting on your male student.
Kristin: Yes.
Jenny: Lend him some Hemingway. Then Buffy wakes up in time to see herteacher
Kristin: Thank god, because who'd want to miss this.
Jenny: Writing some possessed shit on this board.
Kristin: "Don't walk away from me bitch," he writes.
Jenny: Yeah which we know is of course an excerpt from the play that's going on on the balcony every night.
Kristin: Skipping ahead, and we'll talk about this more, I just wanna say that I love that when we get to the end and this is Buffy and Angel and they're role reversed, because it's a very Sadie Hawkins ghost moment where the roles switch, but that they cut from the actual couple in the 50's to Buffy just so she can call Angel a bitch. I was like, good decision I enjoyed that, I enjoyed it.
Jenny: Satisfying.
Kristin: Then Xander gives Sunnydale High School's school motto.
Jenny: "Something weird is going on."
Kristin: Right, which is great..Something weird, so I would like a t-shirt that says "Sunnydale High - something weird is going on."
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: And then, this might be one of my favourite poltergeist moments.
Jenny: Oh it's so great, so great. It's a classic!
Kristin: There's so many good poltergeist moments actually but I love this fucking locker arm.
Jenny: Oh my god it's so great.
Kristin: Right. It's so strong.
Jenny: It's a strong, strong, it's been working out.
Kristin: Xander like, now that i'm saying it I wanna go back and rewatch it, because I just feel like Nicholas Brendon does a really good job of like… do you think that they actually had something pull him or do you think that he just acted that?
Jenny: I think that, I think that the back of the locker situation was reach throughable, I think they had a real arm.
Kristin: I mean yeah when you see the arm yeah but it was just great, I dunno, it just was great.
Jenny: Yeah yeah.
Kristin: And Buffy was like, really prying him off the locker. The students of course, hellmouth students to their core, were just like [silly voice] "mememememe."
Jenny: Right right right, of course.
Kristin: But nobody was
Jenny: Hmm, it is Tuesday. Then, Buffy and Xander go to the library immediately following this.
Kristin: Oh this is great.
Jenny: And everything is perfect, Willow is like, "oh Xander your shirt's all ripped, did you lose a round of locker time with Cordelia?" Or closet time?
Kristin: "No, did Cordelia win another round in the broom closet?" is what she says.
Jenny: Right.
Kristin: Great, Willow, sharpening her comedy chops. Is that what
Jenny: Yes, yes.
Kristin: You don't sharpen your chops? Do you?
Jenny: Well… you hone them? You lick them?
Kristin: Lick your chops [laughter]. Sharpen your wits.
Jenny: We're clearly masters of the English language.
Kristin: Yeah we know a lot of things about a lot of things but then Giles
Jenny: Oh my god there's this great moment of locker monster, loch ness monster! So excited.
Kristin: Oh my god he's so excited about the paranormal, just "oooh, sounds like paranormal phenomenon!"
Jenny: Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. And then Buffy says, "oh, we've got some bad boo."
Kristin: Yeah. We've got a bad boo. A bad boo.
Jenny: Great, so they're sorting through this poltergeist thing and trying to figure out "what do we need to do?" and what they determine is that the poltergeist, the spirit that's haunting the school, needs some kind of closure. So they realise we need to figure out what this thing wants.
Kristin: Oh right.
Jenny: And Buffy's like, "I don't care what it wants!" because she's all conflicted, she is overidentifying much, as Cordelia notes later.
Kristin: As Cordelia says.
Jenny: Ok so then, we see George and Ms. Frank and, we haven't evenmentioned, oh my gosh, all of the guest stars in this episode
Kristin: Oh my god so many.
Jenny: Some of them did great things before, some of them went on to do great things, the guy who's playing James is of course Christopher Gorham from Ugly Betty and Kristin's favourite show Covert Affairs.
Kristin: You guys I loved Covert Affairs, because I love Piper Perabo.
Jenny: We also see John Hawkes in the role of George the Janitor, and he went on of course to be one of the leads in Deadwood and he was in Me and You and Everyone We Know and a bunch of other things and then, Ms. Frank,who he's about to shoot, is played by
Kristin: What an intro for her. "She's about to get shot"
Jenny: Ah! Spoiler! Ms. Frank is played by Miriam Flynn who you might remember as Cousin Catherine from National Lampoon's Vacation, Christmas
Vacation
Kristin: Classic.
Jenny: So great.
Kristin: Right, so this scene happens.
Jenny: Giles hears Jenny whisper "I need you" so he goes out into the hall and sees this happening.
Kristin: This is a fucking powerful poltergeist, like this is straight up in the ranking with the poltergeist from the movie Poltergeist in power, it really, and I'll talk about it a little bit more at the end when it really gets fired up here, but this is a fucking powerful ghost.
Jenny: Yeah this is serious shit going on.
Kristin: This ghost is not messing around so right, so this scene happens, the polter-gun disappears again.
Jenny: Right after Giles tackles George
Kristin: I have a question about the consistency of this story, right, and here's my question. This happened in 1955 and we are to believe that thisghost has been, well these ghosts but really the angrier one, the boy
Jenny: I think what we're seeing is all manifestations of James.
Kristin: But then who possesses… oh he possesses both parties?
Jenny: I think he possesses everyone and plays out both sides until
Kristin: Until he can resolve it. But so it's 1998, this happened in '55.
Jenny: It's not even an anniversary of like an even numbered, 40 years.
Kristin: So by the logic of the story, this would be happening at least every year around the Sadie Hawkins dance.
Jenny: Maybe they haven't had a Sadie Hawkins dance since 1955 because of this terrible tragedy.
Kristin: But don't you think they'd mention it, don't you think they'd bring itup, don't you think the writers would have let us
Jenny: Listen, perhaps that scene was cut.
Kristin: I'm always suspending my, I'm happy to suspend my disbelief, I love this episode, it's a great fucking episode. I just wanna know what do you think, what do you think out there, what do you think this ghost has been doing from 1956 until 1998.
Jenny: Just hanging out.
Kristin: Maybe he's gone on rounds, maybe he didn't do it every year in the same school he's just been making the rounds of all the Sadie Hawkins dances across the country.
Jenny: But it happened at Sunnydale.
Kristin: I know, I'm just trying to give them reasons here. Anyway, my next note, Jenny, is "Our favourite throuple is moving?" Question mark?
Jenny: Yes, yes, they are on the hunt for some fresh real estate and Angel has found, Angelus has found, the perfect place.
Kristin: Yes, replete with night blooming lilac or… I saw an Instagram post about late blooming lilac and I think I confused that with night blooming jasmine?
Jenny: Ooh yeah…
Kristin: So do you think that Willie the Bartender and the stationery man who gives Angel his vampire stationery, there's also a vamp realtor, who's like for the low, low price of 6 bodies you can get… you know what I mean, how do they pay? Do they use money? We're never gonna get the answers to these questions.
Jenny: Well they kill enough people that they could, like, if they're crafty about it, pickpocket or they could get a little more sophisticated that that.
Kristin: Like stealing identities?
Jenny: Stealing identities.
Kristin: Credit cards?
Jenny: Taking out insurance policies on people.
Kristin: Well anyway, our favourite throuple is moving and this is, fucking Angel.
Jenny: This is particularly despicable.
Kristin: It's, but it's so
Jenny: It's so over the top.
Kristin: Right, he takes it to, he takes his ableist bullshit to a place where it almost loses its power at this point, like it's just ridiculous. He says, like fourteen of his sentences in a row are just different plays on horrible ableist jokes. He's like, "hit the stairs, take a stand, roll with the punches," like come on!
Jenny: Please-
Kristin: It's just, no.
Jenny: No, no, no.
Kristin: It's not good but I'm happy to see the 3 of them again.
Jenny: Yeah great. Also Angel's eyeliner has thickened ever so slightly.
Kristin: Has it?
Jenny: Yes!
Kristin: You're doing a great job on keeping tabs on Angel's eyeliner. Doyou
Jenny: Angel eyeliner watch!
Kristin:Do you think that
Jenny: Do I get a jingle?
Kristin: Yeah well I was hoping that you'd make us a graph. Like could you start keeping track now and graph the progress of Angel's eyeliner?
Jenny: Sure.
Kristin: Ok thank you. So we'll let you, we'll give you the start of that graph on social media. We'll keep it… we'll put it on the wall of your office Jenny.
Jenny: Oh beautiful.

Adele's lonely life improves for the first time however when she meets the seductive Beth, but, after Beth pursues her to shirk her duties, Adele faces a dangerous reckoning. Who is Beth?

Kristin: So after we see our throuple moving we go back to the library.
Jenny: Oh yeah and this is sad times.
Kristin: And this is sad times mcgee over here because, first of all, first of all before we get to sad times, Giles says that he has searched high and low. He and the police have searched high and low for the gun and they found nothing.
Jenny: If both the police, if both Sunnydale PD and Giles have searched high and low then the gun definitely isn't anywhere around.
Kristin: [slightly talking over Jenny] Definitely isn't around, also great job with the police being like sure, sure librarian help us look for the evidence. Then my note here is everyone's broken hearts are really clogging the system.
Jenny: Wow!
Kristin: I mean it's sad and we can talk about how it's sad, it's just this episode made me think about how Buffy is super fucked up because of losing Angel, she's really not over that nor should she be.
Jenny: Not just over losing Angel but also over the fact that because of, in her mind, because of her actions Angel not only was lost to her and to everyone, but also killed Jenny Calendar.
Kristin: Right, right, right. And how that of course affects Giles. It's just like they're a mess and usually they are leading the charge here. So I feellike
Jenny: But don't worry. Willow, Xander and Cordelia are up to the challenge of leadership.
Kristin: They're well aware of their limitations, I feel like their leaders are really not firing at, firing with all cylinders and the 3 of them are like oh shit. You know? Are we really supposed to be doing this? But yeah this is devastating because this is the moment that we see Giles say I know who the poltergeist is, it's Jenny. Of course it's Jenny and Willow automatically of course using reasoning is like, why would this be Jenny?
Jenny: Jenny doesn't have anything in common
Kristin: Right there's no overlap here at all, the only overlap is that there is a spirit who had unresolved issues when that spirit passed, so, or when that person passed leaving the spirit behind. So this breaks my fucking heart.
Jenny: Me too. But luckily the Scoobies are ready to get into it. They're not, they go away from Giles, and have their separate conversation.
Kristin: Yeah so this conversation really hit me. Jenny paused so I could take detailed notes because this is, now Willow, Xander and Buffy, Cordelia's not in this conversation. And they have this conversation, and Willow and Buffy occupy like polar opposite ends of their experience of this story. Of the teacher and the student falling in love and the student being furious that their love couldn't continue. Willow is like wow I really empathise with this situation and sort of is trying to understand how feelings of love and abandonment and all of these things could maybe get wrapped up to a place where you do something that you didn't mean to do. Whatever. And Buffy of course, having been through what she's been through, is like fuck that. Like she is on the extreme of the other end saying like, you don't forgive this, you don't whatever, he deserves what he got. And Willow is like he deserved to die? Do you think that? And she's, well no he deserved to go to jail forever. And Xander's just like ping-ponging in the middle between them and I just, I think that it's a really interesting conversation. You know to think about crime, a crime of passion and where it comes from and how we empathise with people who have done something very, very, bad. Or how we have the complete lack of ability to empathise with somebody who has done something bad, it's just, it's really tricky and I feel like they were trying to unpack it here. And I don't know if we got a resolution but that's probably because there's not a resolution, you know what I mean?
Jenny: Right, this is complicated.
Kristin: Deep, deep thoughts by Buffering the Vampire Slayer. But you know what's not deep thoughts?
Jenny: Cordelia?
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Eating a school lunch? What happened to her medically prescribed lunch waiting in the fridge after they found Doctor Gregory in therefrigerator in "Teacher's Pet" maybe she was like never again
Kristin: Oh you think she was so scarred she could never go back to her prescription lunches?
Jenny: I just don't, I don't buy Cordelia not at least bringing lunch with her. Eating that spaghetti? I don't think so.
Kristin: Yeah I don't think so either, but I think also like maybe Cordelia,
Cordelia's been changing a lot
Jenny: That's true.
Kristin: She's been really shifting in her values and her positioning in things and she's also been finding a little bit of happiness I think. So maybe she's like fucking I'll have some goddamn spaghetti, you know.
Jenny: Until it turns into snakes and bites her in the face.
Kristin: Ugh. This is rough. Shout out to Xander for thinking that Sadie Hawkins was invented by a quote "hairy-legged feminist". I just, I was personally excited about this because I am newly back from A-Camp and I have not shaved my legs or my armpits since camp, and I just can't do it I'm just so proud of them. I just, I went swimming today at the pool, I did my laps and I was like yeah mother fuckers! I have hairy legs! Suck it! You know what I mean?
Jenny: Oh wow.
Kristin: So I would just
Jenny: You told them to suck it?
Kristin: I didn't. In my mind I did. In my mind, actually nobody looked at me, nobody cared. But if they did in my mind I would have told them to suck it. So I just was like, shout out to me, shout out this hairy-legged feminist right here. Jenny I'm always shouting you out.
Kristin: Thank you. We get deeper on the Sunnydale governmental and police knowledge of thehellmouth due to this
Jenny: Oh yeah yeah yeah, big conspiracy moment.
Kristin: A lot of big things, like big important plot points. This, yes, Snyder is talking to the police chief, we're on a hellmouth how do you expect me to handle this? The police chief is like do you want me to talk to the Mayor about this, because we were told you can handle this shit.
NOTES: [Jenny makes a noise in agreement]
So just like, we hear about a Mayor
Jenny: I wonder if we will ever meet that Mayor?
Kristin: I wonder if we will, Jenny
Jenny: Snyder is squirming on that hook.
Kristin: Yeah it's just very interesting to me. I mean we'll talk about this more as seasons move on but I just, I'm very curious to know the inner workings of the governmental system of Sunnydale. Because they know, and there are people who know. I just, I wanna know more.
Jenny: Interested to see what develops in that department.
Kristin: So then the Scoobies now are like, on the case, they're like
Jenny: They've got a plan!
Kristin: Yes we're gonna use the menghis tripod says Willow when she's got her little gold stars that she puts in a triangle and this is what they're gonna do, they're gonna go to the school, they're gonna light the candle atmidnight
Jenny: Exorcism
Kristin: Exorcism, which is so upsetting to Cordelia.
Jenny: Yeah
Kristin: I saw that movie
Jenny: Even the priest died
Kristin: Even the priest died. Which is a good call, I mean The Exorcist [woo] I like horror movies, I don't like that movie, uh-uh.
Jenny: So Willow's made these scapulas for them to wear around their necks and she is really spearheading this situation. This casting if you will.
Kristin: Yeah, she's really going for it. She's doing her duty, her Scoobyduty, we talked a little bit
Jenny: Ha!
Kristin: You liked Scooby duty?
Jenny: Yeah it's great.
Kristin: We talked a little bit with Heather Hogan on the live episode last week about how she loves Willow so much because of Willows bravery, that Willow's really going into these situations. Like Xander too, with no special skills and no power but still sort of risking it all.
Jenny: Just good hearts.
Kristin: And Cordelia, my god. 'Scuse me what's going on that I forgot
Jenny: Uh what's… are you saying that Cordelia doesn't have special skills?
Kristin: You're right, she has a million special skills. We go to Dru and Angel. And Spike.
Jenny: Angel's being very suggestive.
Kristin: Angel's being extremely suggestive but also Dru has one of her just incredible, brilliant, Drusilla visions. She is dancing, she is writhing, she is making all manner of noises, I just… I love her, I really, Jenny I think she earned her fucking jingle with this scene.
Jenny: Oh by all means.
NOTES: ["Drusilla jingle"] Dru-silla You-filla my heart with dread And still I'm led right back to you
Jenny: Great.
Kristin: I have a question.
Jenny: Yo.
Kristin: The jingle made me think about things we do, where we talk about the patriarchy and then I was like, who are we gonna give the sexual tension award to? Is it, the ghost and the ghost, because the ghost plays both parts. Is it poltergeist on poltergeist action? Is that the sexual tension award?
Jenny: Or it could go to student James and teacher Grace Newman?
Kristin: It could.
Jenny: Or it could go to Angel and Dru
Kristin: Yeah
Jenny: Because there's a lot going on there, but that whole, you could always use an extra set of hands that Angel says.
Kristin: Right, because he doesn't, he does not say Dru could use an extra set of hands, he says Dru and Spike, well he says "you could both use an extra set of hands" I find this interesting. I find it interesting that they are both going to get help from Angel's hands in a sexual manner. Tell me more!
NOTES: [Jenny laughs]
Kristin: I would like it to go, I mean I love the idea of giving it to poltergeist on poltergeist because it's fun, but I don't know that I can make it through an episode where these 3 are a throuple and not give it them?
Jenny: Yeah…
Kristin: Not to bore the listeners.
Jenny: Yeah yeah, they're working for it though.
Kristin: So, I don't know, Jenny you make the final call.
Jenny: [without any hesitation] I'll give it to the throuple.
Kristin: Alright, throuple it is!
Jenny: Great, great.
Kristin: They're gonna need a trophy room.
Jenny: Oh I love a doomed love though.
NOTES: [Kristin laughs]
Jenny: Can we give out 2 trophies this week?
Kristin: You know what, maybe we can leave this one up to our listeners, maybe we could do a poll this week.
Jenny: Please! Let us know.
Kristin: We're gonna do it together
Jenny: We're gonna do a twitter poll.
Kristin: Everybody calm down, stop sending your emails
Jenny: Delete the email, delete it!
Kristin: If you follow us on twitter you will participate in the first user generated sexual tension award.
Jenny: Oooh this is just like American Idol.
Kristin: Yes, this is just like American Idol, we will tweet out on Wednesdaymorning for who will win - poltergeist on poltergeist or the vampiric thruple
Jenny: Or
Kristin: Oh.
Jenny: The memory of James and Grace Newman.
Kristin: Or the memory of… fine, that one's not gonna win I can tell you that right now.
Jenny: What? Oh I guess it is kind of controversial.
Kristin: We'll put it there, we'll put it there.
Jenny: But, what the
Kristin: No, not because it's controversial because it's a snooze-fest.
Jenny: That's the, that's the love I love.
Kristin: Ok, whatever, you're influencing the audience! I'm influencing the audience too.
Jenny: You are! H ow dare you.
Kristin: Vote as your hearts desire. Ok, we'll put it up Wednesday morning, we'll leave it up for 24 hours, that's it! You're listening to this episode a week late that's it, it's over for you.
Jenny: @bufferingcast on twitter
Kristin: That'll teach you, you've gotta listen right when it comes out.
Jenny: So anyway, Willow runs into Giles while she's preparing to start hercasting and they have this like very mutually distracted moment
Kristin: You're not supposed to be here.
Jenny: Where, neither are you! Hmm scapula? Hmm sulphur? Very good. Hmm yes and then he just goes back into the library and Willow goes on her way.
Kristin: And Cordelia! Nobody told Cordelia that when you're in a horrorshow or movie of any kind, dont
Jenny: Don't look in the bathroom mirror!
Kristin: Ever! You don't ever look in the fucking bath
Jenny: And definitely don't peel off a band aid while you're looking in the mirror, come on.
Kristin: This is like straight out of The Craft, right, this is like the character in The Craft, I can't remember her name this is so embarrassing. The character who plays Marsha in The Brady Bunch, the blonde in The Craft, Ican't remember her name
Jenny: Sounds like a person, I don't know.
Kristin: Anyway, she is like the Cordelia of The Craft. She is very concerned with her appearance, her looks and what-have-you and her thing is that all of her hair starts falling out. And so this reminded me of The Craft for 2 reasons - 1. Because the same thing, it's like the poltergeist knows that Cordelia's weak spot, just like in "Nightmares", is her appearance. And so, gives her this huge scar on her face, and also the scar reminded me of The Craft because Neve Campbell's character has the scarring on her back and that's a whole thing, a plot point. So i felt this was very craft-y.
Jenny: Wow.
Kristin: And then, Willow and the floor, now this is straight Poltergeist.
Jenny: Just getting sucked into the floor.
Kristin: Right, because the, have you seen the Poltergeist movies?
Jenny: Uuuhhh?
Kristin: Jennifer! Just a long umm?
Jenny: I've definitely seen Poltergeist but not like recently enough too
Kristin: Remember?
Jenny: Really remember. I know the TV is on, and like [mimicking the movie] "they're here."
Kristin: And she gets sucked into the TVJenny: And the clown, the terrible clown
Kristin: Right everybody knows the clown. And she gets sucked into the TV and then she's in this alternate reality where they can watch the white static on the television and hear her in the background and it just reminded me of this. With Willow getting sucked into the floor we're like what would happen to Willow if Giles didn't take her out of that situation?
Jenny: Yeah where would she?
Kristin: Where would she be? Would she be in another dimension? Who knows? They blow out their candles, they say their chant, it does not work at all. And then bees, bees, bees, in all capitals.
Jenny: So many bees. Also, Willow and Giles have a great shared moment where after he saves her she's like, Jenny could never be this mean. And he's like I know, I know it's not her.
Kristin: It reminded me that moment between Willow and Giles of that moment between Buffy and Giles right after Jenny died, that like grief moment where they are both also on the floor and like sharing that very intimate thing. Uggh so Giles broke my heart this whole episode.
Jenny: So they run away from the bees.
Kristin: They run away from the bees and Buffy has a sweet door kick, she's like, get out of the way and Giles is like sure, and then she just slams her foot, shatters the door, great great great.
Jenny: Then they regroup at Buffy's house where
Kristin: Oh my god, where is Joyce?
Jenny: [chanting] Where is Joyce?
Kristin: What if Joyce comes home and it's like
Jenny: Oh it's just my, my daughter, her 2 teenage friends and the librarian.
Kristin: Drinking a cup of tea out of my teapot. Like come on. Also I loved how Giles was drinking tea and there was a pot of coffee for the rest of them. It's like, he's British so, he needs tea. Right and then they have, we talked about this conversation a little bit about Buffy and forgiveness and where that was all rooted and Xander has a really powerful line here. Xander and Cordelia do a really great tag team, Buffy getsvery upset, she's angry, she doesn't want to forgive herself or
Jenny: She says James destroyed the one person he loved in a moment of blind passion and like, essentially concludes that no matter why he did it, it's just something he has to live with.
Kristin: Right, and then Xander says he can't live with it, he's dead. Trying to bring her back to reality which doesn't really work, she storms out of the room and Cordelia says "over identify much?"
Jenny: Yes!
Kristin: Ugh Cordelia.
Jenny: Thanks Cordelia.
Kristin: You know what? Goddamit give her her jingle, i can't take it anymore it's been too many episodes without a Cordelia jingle.
NOTES: ["Cordelia" jingle] Cordelia (aah ah) I love you Cordelia (aah ah) You're perfect Cordelia (aah ah)
Kristin: Ok so then we go to what I called Buffy parting the black bees. You know, because like parting the red seas… parting the black bees.
Jenny: Wow.
Kristin: Because it is. She walks up to them and they part and they allowher in
Jenny: We've been expecting you Miss Summers.
Kristin: Yeah and we had a little conversation about Candyman in this part
Jenny: Bleurgh.
Kristin: And you haven't seen it
Jenny: Haven't seen it, haven't seen a single movie ever in all time
Kristin: Yeah apparently. You're 0-4 or something at this point in this episode, but if you have seen Candyman, ugggh, lot of bees, a lot of bees.
Jenny: Lot of bees. Also, sorry we didn't mention that the thing that prompts Buffy to start walking back to the high school is that she finds the Sadie Hawkins flyer from 55 in her jacket pocket and she hears Angel whisper the same thing Giles heard Jenny whisper - "I need you."
Kristin: Yeah, right and so we go, Buffy goes into the school and I think we all think on first viewing of this that Buffy's going to be playing the girl and, you know we don't know who's going to be playing the boy. Giles, they get to the school, Giles is like well there's nobody else in the building how is this going to work? But Angel of course says that wasps don't care about the undead and it didn't matter anyway because he could withstand the stings and he's here in the school, and so we think that he's gonna play the boy and she's gonna play the girl and Buffy's gonna get shot. And that's what the Scoobies think, they're downstairs saying she's gonna die what do we fucking do?
Nothing is their answer by the way, they just stand down there like I mean
Jenny: We can't get through those bees!
Kristin: We can't get through those bees. I mean I kinda feel them and then, but no, there is a role switch here. The old Sadie Hawkins switcheroo. [sings]
The old Sadie Hawkins switcheroo
Jenny: That's… great.
Kristin: [singing] It's just the old Sadie Hawkins switcheroo.
Jenny: No… what do you think
Kristin: [singing] You don't know who you're gonna be it depends on whothe Sadie Hawkins
Jenny: Do you mind if I? Do you think they switch roles because is it the actual day of the Sadie Hawkins dance or do you think they switch roles because in their actual pre Angel being evil relationship, Angel was older. Angel was saying I just want you to have a normal life and you can't have that with me. Like oh she does say that-
Kristin: He knew
Jenny: That James identifies with her because she's so sad.
Kristin: Right. And this again, this poltergeist is so fucking powerful right, the poltergeist is simultaneously pulling Willow through the floor, showing Cordelia her face with scars, causing snakes to attack again in the thing, immediately turning into bees … this is a powerful, powerful spirit. So I think it is also possible that this spirit is so powerful that it knows if it occupies them in these roles that it might have a shot at what it's after. Because for this cycle to be broken the person who gets shot cannot die. And we know that Angel cannot be killed by a bullet.
Jenny: Yep.
Kristin: Unless its a teeny tiny wooden stake bullet. Do you think that would work?
Jenny: Maybe, like how big does, I guess I feel like eventually we see a vampire get staked with like a pencil or something.
Kristin: Yeah. So all I'm saying is - new invention. Guns for vamps - they shoot little wooden daggers. Anyway. That is not what the polter-gun has inside of it, the polter-gun has bullets so Angel doesn't die.
Jenny: Polter-bullets.
Kristin: Ok.
Jenny: But over the balcony he goes, falls on the steps.
KristinK: And shout out to the poltergeist for always having great aim andprecision here with the fall
Jenny: Yeah, so precise.
Kristin: The fall always happens the same, over the balcony.
Jenny: And Buffy goes to the music room to kill herself.
Kristin: So she is in danger still
Jenny: Oh my god but then Angel shows up!
Kristin: Do we think Marcie is still up there? Like, just do we think Marcie is just giggling upstairs?
Jenny: No! Marcie's with the FBI now.
Kristin: Well maybe Marcie wants to like, go back to her old haunts some time [Jenny groans] i'm just saying like maybe.
Jenny: She could, maybe she could be watching everything.
Kristin: So in the band room, Angel, Angel/the teacher… what's her name?
Jenny: Grace Newman.
Kristin: Grace Newman. Comes back and they have this moment where she says, I'm so sorry.
Jenny: It wasn't your fault. Like it was an accident, I forgive you.
Kristin: And then we get
Jenny: While they're listening to The Flamingos version of "I Only Have Eyes
For You" again. Great
Kristin: Great song
Jenny: Love it!
Kristin: Wonderful song. I'll be putting up, just so you know, also on our twitter and facebook pages a picture of Jenny and I dancing at our wedding.
Jenny: Wow.
Kristin: To "I Only Have Eyes For You". It's so thematic, don't you think it's so thematic.
Jenny: Very thematic. So thematic, I'm wearing my varsity jacket, the whole thing. So making out ensues.
Kristin: Well this is very cathartic for the viewer too, like we want almost as much as Buffy wants to kiss Angel. You know, old Angel again. We want to see their love again I think, I do, I shouldn't speak for all of you but like I know I wanted to see it, and getting that moment even though we know it's not them it's these spirits living through them we get to see it. It's really nice, the spirits sort of ascend together into Marcie's room and then Angel comes to. Well, Buffy sees Angel and ugh, heart, that's a moment, that's a really hard moment. Because she's just says "Angel" and then he just recoils and books it. Just runs. And runs immediately to his new home where he takes ashower
Jenny: In the outdoor fountain.
Kristin: With his pants and his shoes on. I'm
Jenny: Furiously scrubbing his upper half.
Kristin: We had issues with Angel putting all of his clothes back on before going out into the alleyway in the rain and I have, I take issue again here. Are you gonna shower or are you not gonna shower? We know that everybody's seen you naked, because you're definitely all having sex together. That much is clear. So why are you showering with your pants on buddy? That's all I want to know.
Jenny: Great question.
Kristin: He's disgusted with love, he felt even a millisecond is way too much for a vampire to handle, so he needs a good kill.
Jenny: So he and Dru leave.
Kristin: Yes in search of a toddler. Sorry toddler.
Jenny: And then.
Kristin: And then!
Jenny: Spike. Stands. Up. and kicks his chair unnecessarily.
Kristin: Unnecessarily and also dangerous because probably he's gonna want to use, like i'm guessing that he's gonna want to use the chair again.
Jenny: Yeah if he didn't stand up already, he's definitely playing some kind of con.
Kristin: So like, maybe don't break your chair man. But this is, this is a big fucking deal, and Jenny I don't know if you know this, there's only 3 fucking episodes left in the fucking season.
NOTES: [Jenny makes shocked noise] So Spike standing up and being back to, at least near to full power, at least enough power not to need the wheelchair, and also his face has also healed.
Which I think we're seeing really for the first time in this episode that
Jenny: No it's been gradually healing.
Kristin: It has been gradually healing, they've been doing a great job with that.
Jenny: I'll be making another graph don't worry.
Kristin: So yeah, my last note of this episode is Spike's back!
Jenny: Really excited to see what that's gonna mean.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Wow.
Kristin: This was a great, this episode was fantastic. Well written Marti Noxon, knocked it out of the park as usual.
Jenny: Well acted. So many fun guest stars.
Kristin: And we got to learn all about how much we hate Sadie Hawkins dances.
Jenny: Yes, yes we did.
Kristin: So, a win win win win win I'd say.
