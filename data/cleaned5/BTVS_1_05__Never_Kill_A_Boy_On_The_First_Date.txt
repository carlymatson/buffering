Buffering the Vampire Slayer
Episode 1.05: Never Kill A Boy On The First Date
Jenny: Hey! Jenny here. Before we get started, I wanted to let those of you in the Chicago area know I'll playing at Beat Kitchen on Friday, October 21st. You can snag tickets at beatkitchen.com. Hope to you see there! And I hope you wear fangs.
Kristin: Hey, what about me?
Jenny: What about you?
Kristin: Well, it's just that I'm gonna be in New York City, in case anyone wants to see me there, but I can't sing… I can talk about gender and sexuality.
Jenny: Oooh.
Kristin: So you know, if you're in New York City and you're into that kind of thing, you should come on down to Blue Stockings on the 21st of October, where I will be participating in the seventh annual New York City Intersex Awareness Day Event. Downtown, Blue Stockings, you can find all the details on my social media.
Jenny: Nice.
Kristin: Yeah!
Jenny: Now that everyone knows where we'll be on October 21st, let's get into it.
NOTES: [Theme Music]
Jenny: Welcome to Buffering the Vampire Slayer, a podcast where we're watching and discussing every episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer one at a time. I am Jenny Owen Youngs.
Kristin: And I'm Kristin Russo. And this week we'll be talking about Season 1, Episode 5, "Never Kill a Boy on the First Date."
Jenny: What a great rule of thumb. Stay tuned at the end of this podcast this week and every week for a recap song that we'll be writing and recording and editing onto the end of this episode! And, wow, what a great time to be alive! Uhh, before we start talking about "Never Kill a Boy on the First Date," we have an important addendum to last week's episode. We forgot something and we are deeply shamed.
Kristin: Yes, I am deeply shamed because I feel like… I don't know why, but I feel like it was my responsibility to remember the Sexual Tension Award. It's my favorite thing. I've really carried the torch and I really- I let it drop last week. But we're here. We- I have a Sexual Tension Award.
Jenny: I can't wait to hear who is the recipient.
Kristin: Is it just- like, do you- are you never going to have one? Is it just me, I dub the-
Jenny: I will disagree with you if I must, but usually I think I'll probably side with you.
Kristin: Okay well, I've done some thinking and for Season 1, Episode 4, my Sexual Tension Award goes to Xander and Blayne.
Jenny: Because of their time together in the cage?
Kristin: Yeah, because like- two dudes talking about how they totally aren't virgins, locked in a cage-
Jenny: Yeah, yeah.
Kristin: There's a lot of sexual tension there.
Jenny: Agree, hard agree.
Kristin: Plus I like to keep it as gay as I can. [laughs]
Jenny: I know you do.
Kristin: So, yeah. Do you accept?
Jenny: Whew! I totally accept.
Kristin: Great.
Jenny: There's like straw at the bottom of that cage, right?
Kristin: Yeah, there was hay. It was kind of like a giant hamster cage. Anyhow. We've moved past the cage.
Jenny: And how?
Kristin: Okay, so something is different in the room today.
Jenny: It feels different.
Kristin: It feels different in here, it looks different in here.
Jenny: Very different.
Kristin: And that is because today, we have our very first guest. Writer, cartoonist, artist, Kate Leth with us!
Jenny: Whaaat?
NOTES: [Fake applause] [laughter]
Kate: Hi! It's me!
Kristin: I feel like in the edit, we need to put a giant swell of applause there. For Kate, 'cause that's what I feel in my heart.
Kate: Just like the sound of confetti poppers and people just like, weeping. If you can catch the sound of single tears but from a multitude of people, that'd be really solid.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah. I've got a whole library of that ready to go.
Kate: Perfect. Great. That's awesome.
Kristin: Every time someone comes over- you haven't been asked to give your single tear recording yet? [Kate laughs]
Jenny: You'll be doing that before you leave.
Kate: That'd be great.
Jenny: I feel like there are so many reasons to be excited to have you here with us, Kate.
Kate: Oh, thank you.
Kristin: One of them is that you brought so many fun toys for us.
Kate: I was-
Kristin: Truly.
Kate: I was really excited. I am very honored as well, like, being in the room. Being in the room of this podcast is like-
Jenny: Wow.
Kate: I feel the like power. [Jenny laughs]
Kristin: Was it what you imagined? Does it look like where you thought this podcast was recorded?
Kate: I mean, I thought there be, like, possibly more cloaks and candles.
Kristin: Yeah.
Kate: But it's pretty close.
Kristin: Jenny does have a- what do you call that lamp? That ionic pink lamp?
Jenny: The salt lamp?
Kristin: The salt lamp! Yeah, she has an Himalayan salt lamp.
Jenny: It would cast a reddish glow, if that would make you more comfortable.
Kate: I mean, we've got sort of that deep orange hue going on here. The lighting is very choice. [Kristin laughs] I'm very happy.
Jenny: Thank you.
Kate: It does not want for anything. But yeah, I came prepared. I brought goodies.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: So much- so many things.
Kristin: I can't decide if I want to start by talking about the episode, or start by talking about what I just found in one of the goodies that you brought with you.
Kate: Oh man. I don't know, I mean, I feel like this choice lays on your shoulders.
Kristin: Great. Just like the Sexual Tension Award. [laughter]
Kate: Well, I have some entries in this episode for that, too [laughter] because Lord knows I live and die by gay sexual tension in TV shows.
Kristin: Nice, nice. Okay, so one of the things that Kate brought is the script to the entire Season 1, like all-
Kate: Well, the first six episodes.
Kristin: Oh, the first six episodes.
Kate: Yes, which is pretty exciting.
Kristin: That like, you just- you- it just arrived in the mail.
Kate: Well, my boyfriend ordered it because- as you do. He found it, like, secondhand for $3 on the internet.
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kate: And apparently we're buying the rest of them? So we're gonna do that. I'm pretty excited.
Kristin: So you-
Kate: It's the actual shooting scripts too, that they used. Which is really neat 'cause sometimes it actually differs from what's on the show. Because, you know, stuff changes on the day or whatever. But yeah, it's pretty cool.
Kristin: Yeah, I was- it was very accurate. I was flipping through and the lines that I read were the lines that I had just seen from this episode. And like, right after we finished watching, I was flipping through and like, everybody was off doing their thing and I flipped to a page that said, "Cordelia and a Cordette enter."
Kate: And I hadn't seen that and I am dying.
Kristin: A Cordette!
Kate: A Cordette!
Kristin: A fucking Cordette.
Jenny: It's pretty good.
Kate: It's so good.
Kristin: That is like, what I aspire- I would like a title like that. My business card should say, like, Kristin Russo-
Kate: Do you know easy it would be for us to get - to make pins that just said "Cordette"? [Kristin exhales]
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kate: And then we can wear them. Because, listen. [laughs] I want to make that happen.
Kristin: Okay, yes. Yes!
Kate: Mm-hmm.
Kristin: It was like, you took what I wanted and made it what I actually wanted.
Kate: I live-
Kristin: I was like: I want to be it, I want a business card, what do I want, Kate? [laughter]
Kate: You want a pin or a button or a patch, or like a crown or a tattoo. [laughter] Something just to really solidify your feelings about Cordelia. Which I absolutely share, and want to get into. Eventually in this episode, 'cause there's a lot to talk about.
Kristin: Yeah, well, maybe… maybe you could start by telling us something about your relationship to Buffy.
Kate: Well um, it's intense. It's long-running. So, okay, I'm trying boil it down because it's- I mean, I could talk for several hours. But I started watching Buffy in real time when it was airing, probably early into Season 2, I think. Um, I'm from Canada and the place that I grew up, we got Buffy a day early for some reason.
Jenny: What?!
Kate: 'Cause it was still on the WB when it was first airing and on ASN- Atlantic something Network, literally. It was on Monday nights instead of Tuesday nights. So we always got it first, but this was also sort of before the internet at large.
Kristin: Yeah.
Kate: So it wasn't like we could spoil it or whatever. Anyway, so that always felt really special. But yeah, I think we started watching it in the beginning of Season 2 and then sort of went back and watched Season 1. And then yeah, watched it every week until the end. The bitter end. And then started reading the comics and watching Angel and you know, all of those things. I have a Buffy tattoo.
Kristin: What?
Kate: Yeah, I have a tattoo of Mr. Pointy on my arm right here.
Kristin: Yes, that's right, Jenny showed me this.
Kate: It's no big deal.
Kristin: We'll have to document that also for social media, so they can see your Mr. Pointy.
Kate: And, um, in junior high school I would say, my very first- maybe second website 'cause I think my first website was about Digimon. [laughing] Was really into that for a period of a time. And then- or maybe Buffy was before that, actually. I had a website on GeoCities called "Kate's Buffy Haven." [Kristin laughs] Back when GeoCities was like- and this is such an internet thing, but when GeoCities was divided into places? You know, it was like, GeoCities slash Hollywood.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kate: Or GeoCities slash- mine was in Area 51 'cause that was for all the sci-fi.
Jenny: Mm-hmm.
Kate: I was in a lot of Buffy-related web-rings. There were a lot of animated GIFs. I had an entire page that was just, um, Sarah Michelle Gellar when she was a brunette. [laughter] I don't know why, because- I mean, she's naturally a brunette and it was like, "Buffy, you know, natural." [laughter]
Kristin: Whoa!
Kate: Yeah, so, Buffy and I go way back. And I have probably rewatched the series upwards of 10 or 15 times. It is… it's very real.
Jenny: [singsongy] Yes!
Kristin: Yeah, I feel like you and Jenny-
Kate: [laughs] This is the only place I can be honest about that and not be like, "Oh yeah, it's pretty cool, I like it. It's fine."
Jenny: This is a safe space.
Kate: Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah, this is a safe Buffy space. But that's kind of your relationship to the show, too.
Jenny: I mean, I never had a GeoCities website about Buffy. But I wish that I had.
Kristin: Do you think we can access that still?
Kate: I tried. 'Cause there are services where you can kinda track down old websites, things that are sort of saved- and there are shells of the Digimon version. [laughs]
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kate: But the Buffy one, I think, is lost. Is lost in the ether.
Kristin: God, what a horrible loss.
Jenny: Ugh. Why?
Kate: It was just mostly photo galleries and my comments on them?
Kristin: Right.
Kate: Like, "great shirt" or "Buffy looks goods in baby blue."
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kate: Which is true.
Kristin: Which is true! [laughter] Buffy does look great in baby blue.
Kate: Like, "Giles, looking serious."
Kristin: Also true.
Kate: "Oz, what a hunk." Stuff like that, yeah.
Jenny: [laughs] Wow.
Kate: This is- I mean, we're on one of the earliest episodes. I like that I got to come in on Season 1, the ground floor.
Kristin: Yeah. This is my first watch through Season 1 and some of the episodes, I've remembered things. And this one was like, blank slate. I didn't know anything. I was like, "Is Owen the Anointed One?" I was like, in it. And the two of you were like, knowing every detail, carrying the script to my house. You know what I mean?
Jenny: You wish Owen was the Anointed One.
Kristin: I guess so.
Kate: Owen, carrying on the time honored tradition of the character that is introduced in the first five minutes of the episode like they've been in the show from the beginning.
Kristin: Yeah!
Kate: Which happens all the time on Buffy, where they're like, "Oh, so-and-so! We're friends and have a relationship." And then they're just gone by the end of the episode, never to be heard from again.
Kristin: Yeah, that threw me off, because that moment when he walks in, everybody's like, "oh, it's just Owen." And I was like, did I miss a thing? But I didn't- I don't know, I think because I didn't know anything that was happening in this episode, I really didn't trust anything. And I was like, it must be Owen. Like, of course Buffy would have a crush on the boy that is, like, actually the demon. You know.
Kate: Well, I mean, in another way, I suppose. But no, not this guy
Kristin: [laughing] Right.
Kate: Not this guy.
Kristin: One of the first things that I noticed in this episode was that I think that Buffy is getting better at fighting. Like, not the character, but Sarah Michelle Gellar is like, getting-
Kate: A little bit, yeah.
Kristin: Yeah, she's getting- 'cause a couple episodes ago, I was like, what is happening?
Kate: Well, I'm on a separate watch-through with my boyfriend. And we are, yeah, we're doing our fall revision. And we're into Season 3, where she's gotten pretty competent. I mean, the- you can still really, really tell the stunt doubles. But she can run and throw a punch. [laughs]
Kristin: Right.
Kate: And so going back and watching this one, which I only watched about a month ago… it's jarring.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: [sighs] Yeah, she has a lot to learn. She did do a backflip. I mean, somebody did a backflip, in this episode. Which I think is the first time that we saw her do, like, an acrobatic move.
Jenny: No, she does some nonsense stuff in "The Harvest" when they're fighting at The Bronze.
Kristin: Ohh, okay.
Jenny: She does some goofy, unnecessary… whatnots.
Kate: Flippin'. Twistin'.
Jenny: Too much flippin'.
Kate: Yeah.
Jenny: But it is like, slightly better than it was just a few episodes ago. Speaking of Owen, great name. Did anybody else read Emily Dickinson in high school?
Kate: [laughing] Oh my god. Uh, I did not.
Kristin: No.
Jenny: I did! And let me tell you what it does not get you: small blonde cheerleader types? [laughter] You know?
Kate: I- in rewatching this, even a month ago. I remember- it was like the memory was coming to me as I was watching it, of Owen's Emily Dickinson thing. And as he started to say it, I was like… no. Just no- like, no boy who looks like that in high school is like, "Oh, by the way. I read really emotional women poets." [laughter] Like, that did not happen. Unless he saw or read on the internet that, like, this will get you girls.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah.
Kate: It's insane, it's insane to me.
Kristin: Maybe that's why I thought that he was the- you know what I mean? Something didn't add up. And maybe that's what it was, but I did not understand what was happening. And like, Buffy, get it together!
Kate: So my favorite thing, and I wrote it down for instances in this episode, is the fact that Owen is- he's cast as this dreamboat, right? Buffy's, like, head over heels for him. And I know that we're supposed to be like, "Buffy, chill out." But, first of all, their interaction is introduced when he basically accuses her of being illiterate. [Jenny laughs] He's like- and if he's not saying this specifically, he's like, "Oh, I didn't think you were smart."
Kristin: Mm-hmm.
Kate: "I didn't think you liked poetry." Later, he comes back to be like, "I didn't think you could tell time."
Jenny: Oh my god. "Here's how a watch works."
Kristin: And then actually, literally explains how a watch works.
Kate: It's incredible. There's, like, three instances in this episode where he basically insinuates that Buffy does not have a totally standard method of just dealing with the world, or like, a totally standard piece of human interaction.
Kristin: Yeah.
Kate: And she's like, [dreamily] "Yeah… " [laughter]
Jenny: What a dream.
Kate: "Yeahh…"
Kristin: Yeah, she's blinded by the light.
Kate: Blinded by it. And I mean, I get it. 'Cause teenagers are nothing but horny, and I get that. [Jenny laughs] But also like, Buffy… come on.
Kristin: I know!
Kate: Come on!
Kristin: Right? But she- they push it really hard. They push it really hard. And she has this whole thing with Cordelia in this episode, which is really rough too. Like, I- you know, I mean- everyone, I think, at this point knows I will cling to Cordelia as tightly as I can.
Kate: And why wouldn't you?
Kristin: I didn't like the dynamic that was happening between them in this episode. Especially- there's a moment that was very upsetting in the cafeteria.
Kate: Oh yeah.
Kristin: Right? When Buffy knocks into Cordelia and then is like, "Oh, I guess her hips are just really big."
Kate: Yeah, like, literally a minute after she's like, "Does this dress make me look fat?"
Kristin: Yes!
Kate: They do away with that. I mean, that whole thing just kind of disappears-
Kristin: Yeah!
Kate: Later in this season but it was pretty cringe-worthy.
Kristin: Yeah, that wasn't- that was not a great thing! And as somebody who is more familiar with the later seasons, I was like, have I- did I miss this? So, okay, so I didn't.
Kate: They were definitely still finding their feet in terms of the writing.
Kristin: Yeah.
Kate: And the interactions, 'cause… yikes.
Kristin: Yikes part two is that fucking fruit punch mouth is back. [laughter] I'm so upset about it. [laughs]
Kate: I really enjoyed your description of that because he is… his face is so bad.
Jenny: It's the worst.
Kate: [laughing] It's so bad. He can't talk. There's so much makeup and prosthetics [Kristin laughs] going on in his face that he can barely speak.
Kristin: Also the way he moves around, it is very bizarre.
Kate: There's a great moment in this episode where he's got one knee up on something. [laughter] Just leaning to tell a story and it is insane.
Kristin: I just… Jenny has this thing, um, with- what is it? Like, porous items?
Jenny: Ugh.
Kristin: That make her- if she sees, like, a pumice stone or the inside of a pepper or a pumpkin-
Kate: Oh, interesting.
Kristin: It- I don't- do you wanna explain what it does to your-
Jenny: [sighs] Oh, it's just terrible. It's just terrible! It makes my scalp tingle-
Kate: Wow.
Jenny: And like, it just makes me so unhappy.
Kristin: Yeah, that- what I see in you when that happens is how I feel every time this character comes on. [laughter] It's like, my body hates it. My body hates everything…
Kate: Yeah.
Jenny: [laughing] My body hates it!
Kate: It's bad. His whole face, his whole scene is just bad. The Master is just bad. [laughter] Just bad!
Jenny: No redeeming qualities.
Kate: And I mean, I love him for being sort of the first villain and he does get a lot of really funny lines. Like, the character is great.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah.
Kate: I love the Master's character, but oh, he just a pickle to look at!
NOTES: [laughter]
Kristin: I also, for some reason, it makes me die laughing that he is still stuck in that bubble.
Kate: Mm-hmm. Oh, for a long while after this, too. [laughter]
Kristin: Every time his little hand touches the thing- [Jenny laughs]
Kate: And it makes that little wibble wobble noise. [Kristin laughs] It's great. I love his scene, his, like, house. 'Cause it's supposedly underneath a church. I feel like they make reference at some point to the Master's lair-
Kristin: Mm-hmm.
Kate: Being under a church. 'Cause I don't think he's directly under the hellmouth. I don't remember. I should know this.
Jenny: No, because later we find out exactly where the hellmouth precisely is.
Kate: Yeah.
Jenny: I'm not going to say it here.
Kate: No, don't.
Jenny: But like, we can talk about it later. But I believe what we know about the Master is- at this point, is that he was trying to open a gate, right? Into a hell dimension and he was in a church. Right?
Kate: Mm-hmm.
Jenny: And then the church sort of collapsed or there was a earthquake at the- something kind of vibe like that.
Kate: Yeah, so he's under a church but it just physically? Just like, doesn't make sense. And also, I mean, the church collapsed but did he send people out for those candles and like… [laughter] what happens- how do people get in and out of it? Is there a staircase? 'Cause it's basically-
Jenny: It's just, he's trapped. Like, everybody else can walk through that force field.
Kate: Yeah, everyone else can come and go.
Kristin: Yeah.
Kate: Which must be such a bummer.
Jenny: And like how did- he obviously has these minions. Who- I don't understand why they're his minions. Because, like, he does nothing that would encourage, um, servitude?
Kristin: Minion-hood?
Jenny: Yeah, minion-hood? He's just mean and he's trapped. They could just leave.
Kate: How does he- does he like yell out of the hole? Like, "hey!"
Jenny: Right. Like, how did he get them to begin with?
Kate: "Hey, come be my servant!"
Kristin: Well, he's- because he's promising them- right, he's promising them, like, eternity and a life of-
Jenny: But he's been trapped underground for 100 years.
Kate: Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah, but like, have you ever heard of, like, cult leaders? [Kate laughs] You know, their reasonings are not that strong either, but you know, they have a certain something.
Kate: Yeah, there's definitely lot of… there's a follower mentality-
Kristin: Yeah.
Kate: To the vampires of Sunnydale. They're always looking for leadership. Always.
Jenny: Right, that's true.
Kate: Someone just has to step up to the plate and take it. [laughter] And he kills them constantly.
Jenny: Yeah, he's always killing them.
Kate: They go down like flies.
Kristin: Yeah, but they just always come back for more.
Kate: Yeah, sure.
Kristin: They're like, "Please, can I kiss your ring?" You know?
Kate: Guys, you should really work for the Master. You get to hang out in a dank church, he pays you nothing and you might die. [Jenny laughs] Check it out.
Kristin: And he's stuck in a wibble wobble bubble! [laughter]
Kate: But he's the best game going.
Kristin: Yeah.
Kate: What else are you gonna do?
Kristin: [laughs] Umm, also I don't- I don't know if we're, like, going not chronologically or whatever. But the guy on the bus… you guys. What is his-
Jenny: He's called "militia man" in the script.
Kristin: "Militia man."
Kate: Really? Oh. That's good.
Kristin: Thank god you brought that script. We know what to call people.
Kate: It's really useful, right?
Kristin: I was gonna call him, like, the Anointed-Non-Anointed. That would have been my name for him 'cause I was like, oh, he's-
Kate: The Un-ointed One. Heh-heh-heh.
Kristin: Aw, nice.
Kate: That only really works on paper. [laughter] If you say it out loud, it sounds exactly the same. Um, yeah, he is fantastic. And the stuff he says throughout the episode-
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kristin: "Pork and beans?" For example? [laughter]
Kate: Pork and beans. Pork and beans. I, ugh. What is- I can't- like, he's singing? "I feel him singing through me." His- something. Oh! I wrote down- one of my favorite things that he says is when he's talking about how everyone has sin and then he says, "It's a liquid!" [laughter] What! Does that mean?
Jenny: Yeah, I wanna know who wrote just his thing.
Kristin: Just his lines.
Kate: They're so funny! They're just [laughs]
Kristin: They're great, yeah, they're great. His whole character is really special.
Kate: He's absurd.
Jenny: Yeah, I wish he hadn't been- I wish he was the Anointed One.
Kristin: I know, I thought- I mean-
Jenny: Instead we have-
Kate: He would be a lot better.
Jenny: Fucking bowl cut. [Kate laughs]
Kristin: Oh, see and I don't- I-
Jenny: You don't know! You don't know!
Kristin: I get the room sense that you both know more about the Anointed than me. 'Cause I…
Kate: Well, he… I believe- I don't think it's a spoiler to say he's lovingly dubbed the Annoying One. [Jenny laughs]
Kristin: Ohhh. Okay.
Kate: By fans and characters alike. [Kristin laughs]
Jenny: Yeah.
Kate: I'm trying to- so you guys usually go- you go through this episode, like, in order, kind of. You break it down.
Jenny: We attempt to?
Kristin: We always- yeah, we always attempt to go in order and we don't. You know, there's like- I mean, I wanna talk about, obviously, some larger themes that happened in this episode. But we-
Kate: And I'm really interested in doing a Buffy Fashion Watch…
Kristin: Yes!
Jenny: Oooh! Oh, lord have mercy!
Kate: 'Cause I'm heavily invested in Buffy fashion. [laughs]
Kristin: [laughing] Why don't we start there?
Kate: Okay, 'cause I have a few things I just really want to point out.
Kristin: Please.
Kate: Um… as like, important moments, and also other things to, like, watch for-
Jenny: Ha!
Kate: As you're watching the series, because, again. [Kristin laughs] I know this show really well. Okay, first of all, Buffy is at her peak wispy bangs in this episode. They are so good. [Kristin laughs] Sometimes they're straight, sometimes they're curly, but they're all framing her face, like, perfectly. They won't get in her way in battle, it's just a really good look. And Buffy has a lot of hair looks, but this is definitely one of my favorites. Also, this episode has one of my top favorite Buffy outfits of all time, which is her enormous, puffy tiger print hoodie.
Jenny: Oh my word!
Kristin: Yes! [crosstalk]
Kate: That she wears- yeah, I wrote it down and I also wrote, "Oh my god, just fuck me up" and like a bunch of hearts around it. [laughter] 'Cause it is- it's- and the hood up! The hood up!
Kristin: Yes.
Kate: It's so good. So this is like- this whole season, Buffy's entire look is like, butterfly clips and mini dresses, so short, you could not bend over, that she fights vampires in.
Kristin: Yeah. You can't even, like, lean to the side in those dresses. They're very short.
Kate: No. You can't. It's impossible. It's a- kind of a good era, but my points for this episode in terms of fashion- because I know you wanna know-
Jenny: Please.
Katie: What I care the most about, are Buffy's cheetah print jacket and also Cordelia's. Crimped. Hair. [laughs]
Jenny: Oooh!
Kristin: I- you are my witnesses. I, like, squealed, when that happened. I was like, no! She didn't! She crimped her hair. I'm already- I already struggle to hold the love I have for Cordelia, so when she goes and does something like that? [exhales]
Jenny: Wow.
Kate: Mm-hmm. Plus, she's paired it with, like, that dark, sheer black collared shirt that she's got tied into a midriff-exposing situation. [Jenny laughs]
Kristin: Ugh. Yeah.
Kate: It's just so good. Cordelia has so many good looks in Season 1. And Buffy's pretty consistent, she's always wearing those brown boots. Always.
Kristin: She loves them.
Kate: I think they could only afford one pair of boots on the show. [laughter] They had to spend all the money on, like, sugar glass and breakable tables. [laughter] So Buffy has one pair of boots. Anyway, that's my Buffy Fashion Watch.
Kristin: Wow. Well, I'm two for two with you. Those were- the only fashion notes I took were that cheetah hoodie.
Kate: Yes.
Kristin: That I would like to own.
Kate: It's so good.
Kristin: It's so- she looks so cool in that hoodie.
Kate: She's so cute in it 'cause she's so tiny and with, like, those straight black legging pants she's got going on.
Kristin: Yeah.
Kate: It's perfect.
Kristin: Oh, and the 90s for leggings, I'll tell you what.
Kate: [whispering] It's so good.
Kristin: Oh, she has this great line in this episode, speaking of the 90s, where she's talking to-
Kate: [laughing] Yes!
Kristin: Right? She's talking to Giles. [laughter] And she's like, "I can slay and have a social life. It's the 90s- the 1990s, in fact. A woman can do both."
Kate: It's amazing.
Kristin: And I was like, nailed it, Buffy. Yeah.
Kate: [whispering] So good.
Kristin: Which like… I don't wanna move us too quickly out of the fashion realm. Jenny, do you have any fashion-
Jenny: [sighs] There was just, like, this one light blue, vaguely tie-dye looking shiny tank top.
Kate: Oh my god, I wrote that down too! It's like elastic sateen or something. [Jenny laughs] And it's a crop top, but it's- it has like an elastic band so it's, like, cinched.
Jenny: Yes, yes, yes.
Kristin: Yeah, and it has, like, a bulls-eye print-
Kate: That's tie-dye, of course.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
Kristin: Yeah, that was good too.
Kate: I mean… Buffy in baby blue… [Jenny laughs]
Kristin: Your favorite.
Kate: Because she looks great in baby blue.
Kristin: You should get back to that GeoCities site, put that up there.
Jenny: [laughing] Yeah.
Kate: Oh, there was definitely a picture of that shirt somewhere on that website. [laughter]
Kristin: But yeah, I- since I brought up Giles and the slaying and the dating, that was the large arc that I wanted to talk about for a minute. Because I know that, like, we're five episodes in, and the first four we sort of, like, got a little bit of a taste of the fact that Buffy lives this dual life. But this was really- like, I feel like we really got into it in this episode where she just wants to date and she can't. Like, her dates are ruined and Giles and her have this moment where he's like, "Are you- you can't tell him what you are." Which is one of the first times that we kind of learn that she has to really conceal this. And that if she ever, like, wants to date somebody, she can't tell them about who she is. And it was, like, a really sad, heavy piece of the episode.
Kate: Well, yeah. 'Cause I mean, almost every other character introduced at this point finds out she's a vampire slayer almost right away. So yeah.
Jenny: She'll just have to date one of them. Xander is campaigning pretty hard. [Kristin groans]
Kate: Oh my god-
Jenny: For a certain candidate.
Kate: This is, like, peak horrible Xander in this episode.
Jenny: It's really the worst.
Kate: It's… so grating. And he- [sighs] I am not, by any means, a Xander apologist. I do not like Xander. [laughter] And it's so funny because when this show was on, I loved him. You know, I mean, I was a teenager and he was a boy on TV so, like, whatever. I was definitely more in love with Willow but, you know, I would come to figure that out later. [laughter] But Xander… he gets, like, a little bit okay in Season 2 and then just, like, terrible again.
Jenny: Ugh!
Kate: But he is so bad in Season 1!
Kristin: Yeah…
Kate: This episode- every time Buffy's like- mentions anything, he's like, "What- what if you touched me? What if- I don't- have you considered my body?" [laughter] He's awful.
Kristin: He's really very pouty and very- and also, viewing this episode with you, Kate, was a joy because-
Kate: You just see me over in the corner-
Jenny: And shaking your head.
Kristin: Yes! Your whisper- like, you would, like, whisper under your breath, like, "Ugh, Xander." [laughter] Every time he, like, did anything. It was really enjoyable.
Kate: [laughing] It's so- I can't stand him. He's just-
Kristin: Oh, but he really was a nightmare, this episode.
Kate: Yeah, yeah.
Kristin: He did some really messed up stuff, just beyond being an annoying "will you touch my body"- he, like, slut shames Buffy.
Kate: Yes!
Kristin: He… just not good for Xander.
Jenny: He did have one really great moment.
Kristin: Oh yeah?
Jenny: Where he- they're in the cafeteria and he asks Buffy how the slaying went and she's like "Xander!" and he's like "Oh! I mean, how'd the laying go?" [laughter] I'm just gonna throw that out there because there's so much to be unhappy about that sometimes it's easy to forget the nice moments.
Kristin: Yes. I'm glad that you gave us one shining moment from Xander. The rest of it was just a flaming trainwreck.
Kate: Well, there's like, that whole sequence where Buffy's getting dressed for her date and he's like-
Jenny: [yells] Ugh! Ugh!
Kate: I know!
Jenny: Come on! [Kristin laughs]
Kate: And she's like, "Which lipstick should I wear?" And he says, "Oh, for when you kiss him and he tells the whole school and everyone loses respect for you?"
Jenny: Oh my lord.
Kate: Xander, eat a bag of dicks!
Kristin: Seriously!
Kate: Like, what is that? It's not unrealistic for a teenage boy to say that.
Jenny: Sure, sure, sure.
Kate: So like, I buy it, but it's terrible.
Jenny: But like… ugh! The fucking- adjusting the mirror-
Kate: Yes!
Jenny: Adjusting the mirror with his back to… ugh! Ew.
Kate: 'Cause he's trying to creep on them.
Kristin: Actually, I was confused. What was-
Kate: Yeah, he's adjusting the mirror because Buffy's changing-
Kristin: Ohh.
Kate: And he's trying to see her naked. 'Cause he's a creep!
Kristin: God. Yeah, he needs to get his shit together.
Kate: Yeah, he does.
Kristin: Really does. Because- you know what's frustrating is that like, he's- he is driving me crazy as a feminist, but also, like, is one of the slayerettes and is, you know, supposed to be part of the team. So I have a lot of conflicted feelings, because as the slayerettes, they were pretty present this episode. They ran, they got Giles, they got Buffy. They distracted Owen, like, they were hard at work. And I wanna just be like, yeah, Xander, great job! But then he's got this whole thing going on where he can't get his act together and he treats Buffy… ugh.
Kate: It's bad. And you're right. I mean, the slayerette moments in this episode are great. And Willow's there, Xander's there, they're doing it. They're getting involved. They're showing us how important they are.
Kristin: They are! They're doing a great job.
Kate: And in those moments- they're great, but Xander…
Kristin: Yeah, I guess if there's two versions of everyone that knows about the slaying, I'm okay with Slayerette Xander. I'm not okay with Person Xander. [laughs]
Kate: Yeah.
Kristin: I'm drawing the line there.
Kate: Yeah, he's bad. He's bad.
Kristin: He really pissed me off this episode.
Kate: Oh. Oh! There was another thing I wanted to point out for your future viewing 'cause I noticed it. [Jenny laughs] Listen, I'm setting a lot of stuff up. Okay, so, in this episode Buffy goes into The Bronze and there's a sign outside that says "DJ Night No Cover." And there's a girl facing the sign, wearing what I believe are sparkly lame magenta bell bottoms? They use that shot or the shot before it as, like, a B-roll multiple times in Season 1.
Kristin: Oooh!
Jenny: Oh man.
Kate: And you- and it's great because there's at least once where they'll be like, "Oh, we're going to The Bronze tonight, there's a band playing." And then the establishing shot, you can see this girl in her magenta pants and it says "DJ Night No Cover."
Jenny: Wow.
Kate: And it happens, I'm pretty sure, at least two or three times. So just keep a weather eye out for that.
Kristin: Did you discover that on your own?
Kate: Yeah, yeah. In the recent rewatch- 'cause we watched a bunch of them in one night and I was like, wait! It's not a DJ night. There's a band play- it's like, the one where Cibo Matto shows up or whatever. Not to spoil that, sorry! But I believe there's a shot and it's like, "DJ Night No Cover." But the pants are so noticeable, and I believe she's wearing a feathery white sweater as well.
Jenny: Oh boy.
Kristin: Gosh.
Kate: Just, you would think they would use a less noticeable extra. But…
Kristin: Although like, as an extra, do you just get paid for the one shot or do you get like royal-
Kate: Oh, you're not getting paid any more when they reuse it, no.
Kristin: Ugh, man.
Kate: You only get, like, the day rate, usually.
Kristin: That girl, somewhere, is real annoyed about that. [laughter] They took advantage of her shot.
Kate: It's a great establishing shot!
Kristin: So Kate, you said you had- speaking of sexual tension. We forgot, but we're not forgetting this episode.
Kate: Hell no. [Jenny laughs]
Kristin: You said you have some nominees.
Kate: Okay, so I have- my sexual tension slash- I mean, is sexual attention and gayest moment separate? 'Cause-
Kristin: I mean, I- you- I don't know.
Kate: There's a really great moment when Cordelia comes up to harass Buffy and Owen 'cause they're dancing together. And she's like, "Oh! You came here alone." Which is such a good burn! [laughter] Such a good burn!
Jenny: The best!
Kate: And then Buffy's like, "We wanna be alone now," and does that, like, swing around him, which was very sexual.
Kristin: Yes. Yeah.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah.
Kate: And then Cordelia's like, "Fine!" and she winks and half sticks out her tongue at Buffy? [laughter] And it goes by so fast, but it's just like, [sexily] "hey." And it blows my mind every time, 'cause it looks absolutely like she's like, "catch you later, Buffy." Maybe that's me reading too much into it, it probably is, but it's a great little cut-away shot. So that's a great moment. I do think- I mean the most tension is probably Angel and Owen.
Jenny: Seriously!
Kristin: Ohh. Yes.
Kate: Pissing contest over Buffy.
Jenny: So much smoldering!
Kate: It's nuts. That part is ridiculous.
Kristin: I'm still trying to- like, I'm trying to pretend like I'm in the conversation. But you see, I didn't see the wink from Cordelia, so I'm reeling over here that that happened and I missed it. [laughter]
Kate: It's so fast, so it probably doesn't even count. But I do look forward to it every time I watch this episode. [laughs]
Kristin: Oh, I mean, it counts. It counts, Kate.
Kate: She's got that crimped hair going on, she's just looking so choice.
Kristin: But you are our guest, and you are going to give it to… to the boys for this episode.
Kate: Yeah, for the tension I would say probably. I mean, you could do it for- I mean, I just don't- Xander doesn't deserve- 'cause it's not tension when it's Xander, it's just- it's sad.
Kristin: Yeah, yeah.
Kate: It's sad. But there is a lot of- um, when he does that- 'cause Angel shows up. And, you know, there has to be that awkward introduction.
Kristin: Mm-hmm.
Kate: 'Cause Buffy's on a date with Owen. I do like-
Kristin: God, that moment.
Kate: I like how she goes, "I'm here on a date with him." Which is cool, that she stands up for her dude and isn't like, "oh, hey Angel, yeah, here's some guy."
Kristin: Yeah.
Kate: I liked that, that's a nice moment, but when he's like, "Yeah, I know her from work."
Jenny: Oh my god. [laughter]
Kate: He's like, "And you know her from… work?" It's a great- yeah, their tension is great.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: The way that he said- the way that Angel says "hey" to Owen [laughter] when they're introduced.
Kate: It's so good!
Kristin: Angel's whole situation in that moment is my favorite.
Jenny: [gasps] Oh my god, and then when Buffy pulls Owen aside to be like, "Listen, there are two me's, and part of me has to go and part of me wants to stay."
Kristin: Yes.
Jenny: And Angel is framed between them.
Kristin: Yes!
Jenny: And he's just like, so intensely watching every moment.
Kate: Mm-hmm. It's so good.
Kristin: He's just like a blurry, jealous Angel.
Kate: He's just so horny for it [laughter] and it is amazing.
Kristin: God, I love a jealous Angel.
Kate: Yes.
Kristin: I love a jealous Angel.
Jenny: That's peak Angel.
Kate: He- you guys were talking about it. Um, because I listen to the podcast.
Kristin: Great!
Jenny: Thank you.
Kate: In, I think, the "Witch" episode. You were talking about how Angel is never this good again, and I completely agree. Season 1 Angel- he's like- he's funnier, he's weirder, he's got more of a personality. He doesn't spend all his time… whining. [laughter]
Jenny: Awww.
Kate: He does a little bit, he does a little bit. But he gets some really good, funny- and good character moments in Season 1.
Kristin: Yeah.
Kate: I like Season 1 Angel.
Jenny: I mean, he's so… mysterious.
Kate: Mm-hmm.
Jenny: And odd.
Kate: 'Cause they don't know much about him yet at this point, right? No. Anything?
Jenny: Don't know anything. Except that he's… good to look at.
Kristin: Yeah, nothing, we only learned his name, like, two episodes ago.
Kate: [breathily] Angel!
Kristin: He only smiled for the first time last episode. [laughs]
Kate: Yeah, and in this one you learn that he's so into Buffy. So into it.
Kristin: Yeah, it's been, like, brewing. But yeah, this episode is definitely like, I wanted this and now- I mean, really- God, it's like every guy at the bar is- is The Bronze a bar? I just made it a bar.
Kate: I do not understand that. I have never understood it because an establishment like The Bronze never existed anywhere where I grew up. Because- I know it's different in the States where sometimes they do, like, wet/dry bars, stuff like that, where you can go in if you're underage and not drink. I know it's not super common but it ex- but that's, like, not a thing where I come from. You can only go to the bar if you are 19 or older 'cause 19 is our drinking age.
Jenny: Wow, 19!
Kristin: Wow, Canada.
Kate: Yeah, we're evolved. It's great. Or in Quebec, it's 18, so… get buckwild. [laughter] But yeah, so, I would watch The Bronze and be like, how are they there? Like, you couldn't- there's nowhere in Canada that you just go to a bar when you're 17 and, like, order a cappuccino. Like that- that doesn't exist.
Kristin: Yeah, also-
Kate: 'Cause it is a bar! 'Cause they get drunk there later and-
Kristin: Right!
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kate: There is beer.
Kristin: Right, and plus, I mean. I don't think my high school- like, I don't think when I was in high school, we hung out like that. Like, we would go to coffee shops sometimes. But we were never, like, getting- going home and getting ready to go out, and then going out to a club or a-
Kate: Yeah, that doesn't- and where… how are they paying for this? They're in high school!
Kristin: Yeah!
Kate: None of them have jobs.
Jenny: Well, it's DJ night, there's no cover!
Kate: That's true, there is no cover. [laughter] But also, this- actually, literally in this episode, it says "DJ Night No Cover" and there is a band playing. [laughter]
Kristin: Oh my god, I totally didn't even put that together. Like, yeah, DJ night.
Kate: It's true. I didn't remember it, because I wrote down, about the singer, "most 90s outfit."
Jenny: Ha!
Kate: Because she has incredibly straight, center-parted black hair, that cheetah print mini dress, and a long black leather trench coat and super dark lips.
Jenny: Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
Kristin: Yeah, she's really going for it too. She's pulling out a lot of the, like, Kristin Russo lip sync moves during her performance.
Jenny: Oh my word.
Kristin: It was very- do we know who that is?
Jenny: Yeah, that band is called Velvet Chain.
Kristin: Ooh very 90- God! 90s, 90s.
Jenny: Super 90s name.
Kate: So good. So good!
Jenny: And she just looks like Beth Gibbons from Portishead. But like… she looks like a person who's way too bubbly in life to be Beth Gibbons.
Kristin: Mm-hmm.
Jenny: Trying to do a Beth Gibbons impression, but, like, moving in a more sort of animated- like, way bigger bends are happening than you would ever see, you know? In Portishead?
Kristin: Yeah, she's going for it.
Kate: I love that they always have bands at The Bronze that are, like, background music. They never- they very rarely have a band that is, like, a rock band.
Kristin: Right.
Katie: People come in and play really soft, sad acoustic songs. Or like- but not acoustic. You know what I mean? It's a very particular genre that Joss was probably really into.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: And that no one really seems to know how to dance to.
Kate: Yeah, well it's like-
Jenny: Oh my god, no.
Kate: Like Cibo Matto shows up, and how do you dance? Like? With a- anyway, it's great. It's- I love it.
Jenny: With a slow shoulder
Kate: Like a really slow shoulder roll? There's a lot- Buffy is- Sarah Michelle Gellar can rock a shoulder roll. [laughter] That is, like, her signature dance move.
Jenny: You know what I'm not looking forward to, is- just, like, thinking about all of the dancing that I know I'm gonna see Sarah Michelle Gellar do. And thinking about how I was feeling when we were watching the cheerleaders do their synchronized cheer- which, so you know, makes me very uncomfortable.
Kate: Yeah, I heard that and that was not what I was expecting. I was expecting, like, oh, it gives me happy tingles.
Kristin: Yeah, no.
Jenny: Yeah, I don't know, I'm-
Kate: But no, it makes you very uncomfortable.
Jenny: I'm not just one thing, Kate.
Kate: That's cool.
Jenny: I'm multi-layered.
Kate: As Cordelia says: "What? I can't have layers?" [laughter] Not in this episode, but later on…
Kristin: Stay forever, Kate! Stay forever!
Kate: When she talks about- she- I think it's in Season 3 when they're talking about- the SATs are coming up and she's like, "I'm excited, I test well!" and everyone stares at her.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah.
Kate: She says, "What? I can't have layers?" It's great.
Kristin: Bless her, bless her sweet crimped hair
Kate: I love Cordelia, and it has been such a gradually accumulating and forming love. Because obviously, when I was a teen watching Buffy, I hated Cordelia.
Kristin: Right.
Jenny: Right, of course.
Kate: She was the antagonist, you know. I wasn't cool in high school, big surprise. [laughter]
Kristin: Your GeoCities sites didn't bring you to the top of the-
Kate: Unfortunately, it wasn't like Emily Dickinson. I couldn't just bring that to the library and pick up all the hot girls but… [laughter] No, I- so I hated Cordelia. And then, you know, when I rewatched it in college, I had sympathy for her because she goes through a lot. You know, she has quite a- but, you know, my feelings about it now are that up until- on the duration of her time on the show- on her tenure, I think she has, next to Buffy, the best character arc. Like, what she starts from and who she becomes and what she goes through.
Jenny: For sure.
Kate: Yeah. She's amazing
Kristin: Good thing there's a song for this part. [Kate laughs]
NOTES: [Jenny performing the "Cordelia Jingle"] Cordelia (ah-ahhh) I love you, Cordelia (ah-ahhh) You're perfect, Cordelia (ah-ahhh)
Kate: I love this song.
Kristin: [laughs] I said it- so, we put it up- in case you don't know, the- go ahead, tell them, Jenny. Tell them.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we should let you know that beautiful Cordelia appreciation jingle that you just heard is available for iPhone users in your iTunes store as a ringtone! Or-
Kristin: Ah, that's what I was gonna say. One- uh, somebody on Twitter said, "I bought this but not for a ringtone, I bought it for my alarm."
Jenny: What a way to wake up.
Kate: [gasps] Oh my god.
Kristin: And I woke this morning, this very morning, I woke up to [sings] "Cordelia… " I was so excited. Jenny was, like, passed out and I was like, "Good morning!" Ready to go!
Jenny: Wow.
Kate: Oh my god. That is such a good idea that I am going to adopt immediately. [Jenny laughs]
Kristin: Yeah. It's a beautiful thing to wake up to in the morning. It's really, really fun.
Kate: She is so good. I mean, I love Willow and I don't love Xander. But Willow doesn't get a lot to do until she kinda starts getting into other things and exploring herself a little bit more. But Cordelia, man, she's got- she goes through so much.
Kristin: Yeah, Willow is really like, Hacker Willow at this point.
Kate: Yeah.
Kristin: Anybody needs the internet, they go to Willow. She knows what's up. Willow- not to jump back into fashion, but Willow's braids were on point this episode.
Kate: They're great. She has- Alyson Hannigan, at that point in her life, had the sleekest hair of any human.
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kristin: How do you-
Kate: Just so smooth. Just like a silk sheet, pouring from her head.
Kristin: Like a Pantene-
Jenny: Like an auburn panther.
Kristin: [laughing] Like an- the difference between you and I, Jenny, in that moment.
Jenny: What did you say? Like a Pantene- [laughs]
Kristin: I was about to say, like a Pantene commercial, and you said what?
Jenny: Like an auburn panther. [laughter]
Kate: See, I thought you had said, like, an aubergine. [Jenny laughs] And I was trying to parse that.
Jenny: Wait, is that an eggplant?
Kate: Yes, it is. [laughter]
Kate: I guess they're sleek? Smooth.
Kristin: Yeah, they're shiny.
Kate: Cool yeah sure, for sure. [laughter]
Jenny: [laughing] Uh, I don't know if I've ever said aubergine. Ever!
Kristin: Well, now you have.
Kate: Oh! Owen's fucking pocket watch.
Kristin: Oh my god! [Jenny laughs]
Kate: Like… what? Are you doing?
Kristin: [laughing] And also the setup of the pocket watch, and then the completely non-explained, non-sequential shot of Xander's watch. [Jenny laughs]
Kate: Well, it's great, 'cause he's like, "Oh, I'm not as good as him 'cause I have this watch." But like, at least you're not the douchebag who has a pocket watch in high school! [laughter] Who are you?!
Kristin: Yeah, I'm telling you, I don't trust that guy. It doesn't add up.
Jenny: No, no.
Kate: That is just not an accessory that you want in high school. You just don't. [Jenny laughs]
Kristin: Ugh, but you know- you know what an accessory that you do want in high school is though? A beeper. [laughter] Because…
Kate: Yes! Ohh, Buffy's beeper. Which comes back, you know, a number of times in Season 1 and then is never, I think, spoken of again? I can't remember. [Jenny laughs]
Kristin: God. They just had some really nice close-ups of the beeper in this episode that made me happy.
Jenny: Oh my word.
Kate: So great.
Kristin: Did you both have beepers?
Jenny: Of course!
Kate: No, I think I was-
Jenny: What?!
Kristin: Were you aged out?
Kate: I think I was a little young, 'cause I think my first technology that I had- I didn't have a beeper. My dad had a beeper, every- like a lot of people I knew. But I think I was too young by a couple years. 'Cause my first technology was one of those Nokia brick cell phones that could only-
Jenny: Oh, yes.
Kristin: Oh! You could play snake on that. Ugh.
Kate: You could play snake on it! And I had that in my last year of high school and it was like- I wasn't allowed to take it to school. That kind of thing. God, what a time. [Jenny laughs]
Kristin: Yeah, so you were a little bit behind us.
Kate: Yeah.
Kristin: Well, I- did you have a beeper, Jenny?
Jenny: Hell yes!
Kristin: Yeah. My best friend had two beepers.
Kate: What?!
Jenny: Wow.
Kate: Like in Clueless!
Kristin: Yes, exactly.
Kate: [whispering] Wow.
Jenny: Wait, what was the purpose in Clueless and what was the purpose in your life?
Kristin: He didn't have a purpose, but he used to joke about it, like, he would be like, "Oh, this one's for the ladies to call me and this one's for the-"
Kate: Oh, no!
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Wow.
Kristin: He was gay, so it was okay.
Kate: Oh, okay.
Kristin: It was a- yeah.
Kate: Instantly forgiven. [laughter] What a rollercoaster I just went on.
Jenny: Wait, so, meanwhile. Giles and his death newspapers! Always with a death newspaper, Giles is.
Kate: Oh, I wanted to ask you- because you had, like, a visceral reaction when Giles pulled up to the funeral home in his car.
Kristin: Oh, yeah!
Kate: You, like, jumped out of your seat and then sat back down. [laughs]
Jenny: Oh my god, because the Sunnydale funeral home sign… their sloganis: "We'll take care of the rest."
Kate: [laughing] What?!
Kristin: What?!
Jenny: [laughing] Yeah. [laughter]
Kate: That's so good!
Kristin: Oh, god!
Jenny: It's pretty great.
Kristin: That's brilliant.
Jenny: You guys. I don't know how I've never, like, taken strong note of this before. But in this episode we learn that Giles comes from a line of watchers. His dad and his dad's mom were watchers.
Kristin: Oh, yeah!
Kate: Yep.
Jenny: And his dad sat him down when he was ten, and told him what his destiny was gonna be. And he wanted to be a fighter pilot.
Kristin: He wanted to be a fighter pilot.
Kate: Or perhaps a grocer.
Jenny: [laughing] Or perhaps a grocer.
Kristin: Giles and Buffy, in this moment.
Kate: It's really sweet, and she's so… worried. When she's like, "I could have gotten you, you could-" [crosstalk]
Kristin: Yeah, yeah, and also his- I mean, he's shown a little bit of, like, sympathy for the fact- I mean, when the whole cheerleading thing happened, you know, he was like, rolling his eyes. But also, you know, "Buffy, sorry, but this is your life. And it's gonna be hard to have a social life." But I feel like it's… I don't know. The moment when Owen says to her, "I really wanna do that again, because I wanna be near the danger." That, like, broke my heart into 400 pieces. Because it was just, like, this moment for her where she was like, "Oh, right. Like, as much as I want a normal life, I won't ever be able to have it." And, like, she keeps seeking it. Like, she wants to be on the cheerleader team and she wants to go on dates, and she can't. No matter what she does, she can't. She is the slayer, and she has to carry this weight. And so to have her and Giles have this moment where he's just like, you know, on some level, I've had to make these sacrifices too. And like, I can be here with you and… it sucks. I feel like that's kind of the moment they have, where he's like, "It sucks, but like, it's gonna be okay."
Kate: Yeah, it's a really sweet exchange.
Kristin: Yeah
Kate: You know, especially- they start the episode pretty antagonistic towards each other. [Jenny laughs] And I love their moments together. They're really sweet.
Kristin: And then, you know. Right when our hearts are full of a sweet moment, we have to go back to the worst place in the world. [Jenny laughing] You know? Like, can't they give me a minute in this show?
Jenny: [laughing] Nope.
Kristin: To have moment without that mouth?
Kate: Head back on down to the snake hole!
Kristin: Right. [laughter] Something that we haven't done yet, Jenny, is we haven't said the word.
Jenny: [yells] The patriarchy! [laughter]
Kristin: Okay, yeah, alright.
Kate: Well, I can't believe it didn't- naturally put that in there. Feels right now.
Kristin: I know, I know. I mean, I don't want to force it but we've made a commitment. So, you are our first guest, ever. And we have something for you, because you are our first guest. So I'm- maybe close your eyes and I'll get it.
Kate: Okay, alright, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.
Kristin: Kate looked at me like maybe I was just pretending to tell her to close her eyes.
Kate: Yeah, I was like, is this- do I lie?
Jenny: Okay, reach out your left hand.
Kate: Oh my god. What is this?
Kristin: Okay, this is your gift as our first guest ever.
Kate: Can I-
Kristin: You can open them now. Yeah, you can open them. It's upside down.
Kate: Oh my god! [laughs and shrieks]
Kristin: [laughing] We- this is a great moment of suspense for our listeners, "what is it?!"
Kate: They're small sexy. [laughter]
Jenny: They sure are.
Kristin: They're small, sexy… go ahead, tell them, Kate, what-
Kate: Well, they are deluxe custom vampire fangs, Kristin, that's what they are. [laughter]
Kristin: Tell them- tell them what you've won!
Kate: Oh my god! I almost buy these every Halloween. [laughter] I tried to order these when I was in high school. Because, in Canada, we don't have anything. We're deprived of vampire fangs. [laughter] You don't know what it's like up there. But- my cheeks hurt, I'm smiling so much right now. [laughter] The picture on this box is a lady and she's wearing- obviously wearing the scarecrow vampire fangs. Love these fonts, by the way, just dying over these fonts. Spared no expense on fonts. [laughter] She's, like, got fire coming off of her tongue, bedroom eyes, I believe she has a tattoo, scandal.
Kristin: She's pretty scandalous.
Kate: I also don't know if you've noticed, in the bottom right hand corner, where it says made in USA, that the flag is shaped like a pair of fangs with a blood drop coming off!
Jenny: [laughing] Oh my god.
Kristin: What? I did not!
Kate: Wow, small sexy, deluxe vampire fangs. I'm sorry.
Kristin: And Jenny and I have our own, we have a set each, as well.
Kate: Yeah, of course. Of course you do.
Kristin: So the three of us now can be vampires whenever we want.
Kate: I'm just like- I'm- this is the greatest. This is the best thing, I'm so pleased. These will go to good use.
Kristin: I'm so glad.
Jenny: That is so great
Kate: They will- guys, you're too good to me! You're too good to me! [laughter] Yay.
Kristin: I just want- I mean, I want to watch every episode with you, just because it's fun to watch with you.
Kate: Oh, I'm around. [Jenny laughs]
Kristin: But I really want it because I love the Xander whisper. It's something that I'm gonna- [laughter] like, I feel like I'm gonna hear it even when you're not there, you know?
Jenny: Totally.
Kate: My boyfriend has gotten used to it but he will occasionally, like, side-look at me and when like, [whispering] oh my god, Xander.
Kristin: Yeah.
Kate: Oh my god, Xander, shut up. Oh my god, I hate you, Xander. It's bad. I would love to come back at some point. I know you have a lot of very esteemed people and I am excited to listen to it, but this has been an absolute joy.
Kristin: I mean, we would- I'm speaking for both of us, love to have you back.
Jenny: Absolutely.
Kate: I can't wait to do the entire next episode wearing my small sexy fangs. [laughter]
Kristin: Yes! The next time that you're- yes. The next time that you're on, we should all wear our fangs.
Kate: [with a lisp] My opinions on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. [laughter] I can't wait, it's gonna be great.
Jenny: Um, wow, Kate. Everyone listening has fallen in love with you. [Kate laughs] Where can they find your work and your person on the internet?
Kate: Wow, a lot of different places. The hub is kateleth.com, my last name's L-E-T-H, because no one ever knows how to spell it for some reason, even though it's only four letters.
Kristin: Leth, yeah.
Kate: My Twitter's Kate Leth, My Instagram's Kate Leth. I'm on Patreon, where you can read my sad comics about my feelings if you want, which is also Patreon.com/kateleth. It's all- you just look up my name.
Kristin: Just Google some Kate Leth! [laughs]
Kate: It's pretty straightforward. I write Hellcat for Marvel. I do that too.
Kristin: Ow, ow, oww!
Kate: Yeah, and uh, that's kinda my jam.
Kristin: So many cool things.
Kate: It's fun. And I talk about Buffy a lot. [Jenny laughs] Here and elsewhere.
Kristin: God, and don't- we can't- we have to remember to get a picture of your Mr. Pointy tattoo.
Jenny: Your Mr. Pointy tattoo and the amazing drawing that you made while we were watching.
Kristin: Oh yes! Yes, while viewing, Kate sketched-
Kate: And I gotta tell you that I was actually wearing a Buffy T-shirt earlier today and I changed out of it 'cause I thought it was too much. [laughter]
Kristin: Oh, never too much.
Kate: I got- my mom bought me a really great Sunnydale High Slayers Club T-shirt.
Jenny: Nice!
Kristin: What!
Kate: Yeah.
Kristin: We need to get some Buffy T-shirts in this family.
Jenny: Agreed.
Kate: Oh man, there's so many good ones out there.
Kristin: Why don't we have any?
Kate: I have a great one that's got Spike, Buffy and Willow on it, and it says "Demons, Darkness, Dangerous Women." And I've had it for, like, nine years and I only wear it on special occasions 'cause it's-
Kristin: Oh, it's like falling apart?
Kate: It's like falling apart. [laughs]
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kate: But it's so special to me!
Jenny: Wow.
Kristin: Dangerous- they were like, what should the third "D" be?
Kate: Yeah, and I love that the characters are Spike, Buffy and Willow. Like what a weird assortment of characters. [laughter] Great.
Kristin: But yes, please come back.
Kate: I would love to.
Kristin: Come back, come back.
Kate: I would love to.

Kate: I really got into that, yeah.
Kristin: Yeah. It's beautiful. [Jenny performing "Never Kill A Boy On The First Date," off the album "Songs from Season One" by Buffering the Vampire Slayer] It seems like I can't go a week Without some ancient prophecy Tripping me up Xander, shut up Thought I might get to have some fun But now there's this Anointed One Threatening to rise From the ashes of five And I know I should stay focused And the world depends on me But who can think about that stuff When a cute boy's reading poetry? Being chosen is a thing that's easy to hate But I know who I am and I know it's my fate
You might be a slayer if you can relate: It's hard to never kill a boy on the first date Never kill a boy on the first date Cordelia, you're no threat to me But Angel's looking jealously At Owen, oh no The secrets, they grow The gang's all here, we have to go To the romantic funeral home Where Giles is trapped With guilt, I am wracked And I know he's not my dad But he still looks after me Which is nice since no one's seen my mom Since back in Episode Three Being chosen is a thing that's easy to hate But I know who I am and I know it's my fate
You might be a slayer if you can relate: It's hard to never kill a boy on the first date Never kill a boy on the first date By the way, I'll wear whatever I want And Xander, it's uncool To try to slut shame all your friends Just because they won't go out with you! Ooooh, ooh, ooooh, ooh Being chosen is a thing that's easy to hate But I know who I am and I know it's my fate
You might be a slayer if you can relate: It's hard to never kill a boy on the first date Never kill a boy on the first date
