Kristin: [laughing] Also, on March 10th- many of you probably know what March 10th is, but if you don't, it is the 20th anniversary of the first episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer airing here in the United States, on the WB. And so, we are in quite a festive mood about it and we are going to be doing a free live streaming Buffy-watch of Season 1, Episode 1, "Welcome to Hellmouth," at 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time- that's 5 p.m. Pacific Time- on facebook.com/bufferingcast. We're gonna watch through the episode. The way that it works is that you have your DVD or your Hulu or your Netflix or however you watch Buffy. We all queue up together, you hit play on your end, we hit play on our end. You hear some of our commentary, we all chat together. It is… very, very fun and it is going to be a wonderful way to celebrate [whispers] 20 years!
Jenny: Hooray!
Kristin: Can you even believe it? Twenty years! So we will see you hopefully on March 5th and March 10th. And if not, we'll see you sometime soon.
Jenny: Yeah!
NOTES: [Theme Music]
Jenny: Oh my God, hello and welcome to Buffering the Vampire Slayer, a podcast where we are watching and discussing every episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, one at a time. I am Jenny Owen Youngs.
Kristin: And I'm Kristin Russo and this week, we're talking about Season 2, Episode 7, "Lie to Me." Stay tuned at the end of this podcast every week for an original song written by us recapping the Buffy episode we are discussing.
Jenny: "Lie to Me" was written and directed by Joss Whedon, a guy we've heard of [Kristin laughs] and originally aired on November 3rd, 1997.
Kristin: And this is the one where Buffy is lured into a trap by a group of undead wannabes who hope that Spike will make them vampires in exchange for giving him the slayer.
Jenny: Wow.
Kristin: You like the IMBD?
Jenny: They did a great job!
Kristin: IMBD rocks it out with their summaries.
Jenny: I would've said,this is the one where Angel gets jealous, Willow can't lie, Ford is stupid and… Buffy is great.
Kristin: There's the episode. We can just- that's the- awwwooo!
Jenny: Yeah, awwooo!
Kristin: Just kidding. [laughs]
Jenny: So wow, what a great episode!
Kristin: Yeah, this is a phenomenal episode. I have a lot that I wanna talk about and I know you do too.
Jenny: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Kristin: So let's just jump right into the opening shot, where-
Jenny: That playground!
Kristin: What d'you call that thing?
Jenny: Ooooh, it's not a merry-go-round.
Kristin: That's what I called it, a merry-go-round thing-
Jenny: Right.
Kristin: At the park where you spin around and you use your feet- you spin and then you hop on- it's a great playground pastime.
Jenny: If you know the name of this playground staple, please tweet it at us, thank you.
Kristin: Yeah. @Bufferingcast.
Jenny: Mhm!
Kristin: That's like, 722 mentions. [laughter] Everybody has the name for it. It's more fun than Google, you know?
Jenny: Yeah!
Kristin: Anyhow, this opening scene. I screamed. You know if you listen to our series, how much I am obsessed with Wes Craven and this is- this playground tool is in many a Wes Craven Nightmare on Elm Street.
Jenny: Yeah!
Kristin: That's where the little creepy children sit-
Jenny: Yes!
Kristin: And they sing, [sings] one… two… Freddie's coming for you.
Jenny: Yes. Is there anything creepier than a swing swinging slightly at nighttime empty playground?
Kristin: You know, I think a couple of things, but-
Jenny: But it's up there, right?
Kristin: It's up there.
Jenny: It ranks?
Kristin: So the other day, I took a shower. I do that sometimes.
Jenny: Oh, fuck.
Kristin: I know, I have to keep telling people now. This happened to me and I didn't tell Jenny about it until that night, it happened to me in the morning. I was taking a shower and our bathroom is set up where it's like, a stand up shower, like little square situation, and then directly next to it is a bathtub. It's- [laughs] it's so pointless 'cause you can either, like, take a bath and use all of the space or you can take a shower and be stuck in a little box.
Jenny: Mm-hm!
Kristin: Anyhow, I was taking a shower. I had turned the water off and when I turned the water off in the shower, I heard water still running and so I was like, oh god, is there like a leak somewhere? It sounded like, you know, if there's a huge leak in your house, like the toilet is leaking to floor below or something. [Jenny laughs.] And I was like, oh god, what is that noise? And I looked and the bathtub faucet had been turned on-
Jenny: [uncomfortably] Ughh!
Kristin: And the water was running and I- this is like a true testament to the power of the human brain. 'Cause I was like, [higher pitched] I must have just knocked that… [Jenny laughs] on… with my body accidentally. And [laughs] learned very quickly when I said it out loud to Jenny that, no, it's terrifying. I don't know what happened. So that ranks up there with an empty swing swinging, I think.
Jenny: Yeah. Also-
Kristin: Faucets turning on by themselves.
Jenny: Yeah. The chair that your sitting in right now-
Kristin: C'mon! What!?
Jenny: Okay. [laughing]
Kristin: What about it?
Jenny: Nothing!
Kristin: What? Oh, the ghost that's in the studio.
Jenny: Yes! Yes.
Kristin: Go ahead, tell them.
Jenny: Well, some friends of ours-
Kristin: You didn't have to start by being like, "the chair you're sitting in right now-"
Jenny: You could sharing space with a ghost right now.
Kristin: Well, I would be happy to share space with a ghost-
Jenny: That's very nice.
Kristin: As long as it's a nice ghost.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So friends of ours stayed in our place while we were out of town. And after they left, they got in touch with us and they were like, "do you have a ghost?" And we were like, "fucking- not that we [yells] know of! Why are you bringing it up?" [Kristin chuckles] And they were like, "well, every time we walked past the door to your studio, we could see a shape in the chair-" the chair that Kristin's sitting in right now.
Kristin: No big deal. Okay! You- I think you've established your point, [Jenny laughs] Jennifer…
Jenny: We live in haunted-ass house, I guess?
Kristin: So we have- it isn't- I wouldn't classify it as haunted but I think there's some-
Jenny: [laughs] I thought were gonna say, "I wouldn't classify it as haunted-ass."
Kristin: [laughs] I mean, there's something going on but there's- like, let's be real, there's something going on in everybody's house. A little bit.
Jenny: Now I'm going through my mind files of all the times you're gonna be out of town in the next, like, six months…
Kristin: Oh, brother.
Jenny: And I'm gonna be here alone. Wahhh.
Kristin: Yeah, and the ghost is gonna be like, "hey, remember that chair you were sitting in?" And make you feel scary-
Jenny: No!
Kristin: Scared. Anyway. [Both laugh.] We get past this scene in the playground with the spinny thing and now we meet this child-
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kristin: This unnamed child who has one of my favorite moments in the entire episode 'cause I think it's the first line we hear which is, [laughs] "C'mon, Mom. She's always late." And it's like- [both laugh] thank you for the exposition, like, we've established what is happening via this child's line.
Jenny: Yeah. Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Kristin: So yeah, this child is alone.
Jenny: And then from the gloom, emerges…
Kristin: As always.
Jenny: A pure white lamb. [Kristin laughs] Actually, speaking of lambs, I guess this is why I have the image, because I wrote down the lyric of a song that her mother used to sing her-
Kristin: Ugh!
Jenny: [sings creepily] "Run and catch, the lamb is caught in the blackberry patch." Ahhhh!
Kristin: Yeah and she follows her, like, rendition by saying, "she had the sweetest voice." [laughter]
Jenny: Yeah!
Kristin: I think either you're singing it differently or you misremembered, Dru.
Jenny: Yeah. So good.
Kristin: But yeah, so Dru is just creepy as all get out.
Jenny: And gettin' closer and closer to the kid. He's like, "I'm not supposed to talk to people." She's like, "I'm not a person." Yes!
Kristin: Yeah, "I'm not a person" and then she's like, [in Dru's accent] "I wonder what your mother will think when she finds your body." [laughter] Come on!
Jenny: And then Angel, who we still continue to wonder, can he fly?
Kristin: Right?
Jenny: Inserts himself at light speed-
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Between Drusilla and this kid. And he's like, [deep growly voice] "Run home. Now." [Kristin laughs] Yeah, who's scarier in this scene? To the kid, do you think?
Kristin: To the kid? I think-
Jenny: Probably Angel…
Kristin: Drusilla.
Jenny: Really?
Kristin: I would remember…
Jenny: She seems unhinged but Angel seems like-
Kristin: I mean, Angel's definitely, like- I mean, the kid listens, so the kid is scared to the point of running from Angel, but I think it's more of a powerful fear than like a- haunting you for the rest of your life in your nightmares kind of a fear, which is what Drusilla, I think, presents here.
Jenny: Right. Right, right, right.
Kristin: And then I have to give- I mean, and I'm sure I'm gonna do this so many times. But Juliet Landau. [Jenny laughs.] Are you kidding me? This scene between her and Angel, between Juliet Landau and Angel. [laughter] But this scene between them is- she is incredible. The way that she, like, angles her head up towards his face while she talks to him and then, [laughs] please go back and rewatch when she walks away.
Jenny: Oh my god. The look while she's walking away.
Kristin: It's unbelievable! Like, I can't imagine- you know, a lot times you're like, oh well, you know, what a great decision on the director's part to say, "oh, do this this way and would probably be effective" or what have you. And, you know, that there's this equal shared space between, like, an actor and the director and how it comes together. I just don't believe that this had much to do with the direction. It just seems to emanate from her being.
Jenny: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Kristin: Even if somebody said, "walk away creepily." Like, I would [laughing] never wind up being able to do what-
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Drusilla does, Juliet Landau does in this moment.
Jenny: Well, what's- I think that what makes her extra creepy is that she's rarely… deliberately menacing.
Kristin: Right!
Jenny: There's always this just sort of like… detached, kind of unhinged…
Kristin: She's just telling it like it is.
Jenny: Slow creep- yeah, yeah. Very matter of fact within her own universe.
Kristin: Yeah. Ugh! I love her and I know this is early but I think that Drusilla earned this early. Can we hear the Drusilla jingle?
Jenny: Here it is.
NOTES: [Drusilla jingle] Drusilla, you fill up my heart with dread And still I'm led right back to you
Jenny: Okay, so that was the Drusilla jingle [Kristin laughs] and just in case you're wondering, if you're an iPhone user, that ringtone is now live. You can go into the iTunes store on your phone and find the Drusilla jingle. We're very excited about it.
Kristin: So good.
Jenny: Our growing catalogue of ringtone jingles.
Kristin: Also, shout out- someone- we retweeted someone within the last couple of weeks who tweeted at us about Drusilla and used the most remarkable emoji combination to describe Drusilla. It was like a bat, a dead rose, the witchy globe- [Jenny laughs] and I think the coffin and one other thing- it was-
Jenny: The dark side of the moon, maybe?
Kristin: Yeah, yeah! It was just, like, unbelievable, so shout out to you, human being.
Jenny: Way to go.
Kristin: Way to go. Nailed it, totally nailed it. Last thing before we get to the credits is, at first, when I watched this opening, I was like, how long has this kid been waiting for his mother? It's like-
Jenny: It is so dark!
Kristin: It's so dark! But then, later on in the episode-
Jenny: Ohh, sunset-
Kristin: We learn that sunset is at 6:27 now, so you know-
Jenny: Right, not that late.
Kristin: After school programming, yeah.
Jenny: Sure, sure.
Kristin: I gave the mom a little bit more of a pass [laughs] than I did in the initial viewing.
Jenny: Yeah. The two things that I want to say before we go past the credits, is Buffy sees this happening?
Kristin: Yep.
Jenny: Buffy sees Angel and Drusilla engaged and they're very close and especially with her head tilting, it looks like maybe they could be kissing or something.
Kristin: Right.
Jenny: Okay, and also…
Kristin: Drusilla kind of always looks like she could be kissing the person she's talking to.
Jenny: That's true.
Kristin: [laughing] Right?
Jenny: And also, the way that Angel says "hello Drusilla." It's, like, very formal and very guilty. As someone who really, like, gets guilt.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: That really just rang out to me. [Kristin laughs] I was like, yes, I know where you are.
Kristin: Yeah, you have a lot of overlap with Angel's ability to feel guilty. And as we'll talk about in a little while, I noticed a parallel between you and Giles in this episode.
Jenny: What a delight. What a delight, hooray.
Kristin: So right, so Buffy sees this, setting the tone for this episode, which really orbits arounds lies.
Jenny: Right, right, right.
Kristin: And the complicated nature of lies, that they're not black and white things, they're not always bad and they're not always good and they're usually somewhere in between.
Jenny: Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Kristin: But before we start digging into that… can we talk about Jenny Calendar and Giles? [Jenny and Kristin giggle and hoot]
Jenny: Yes!
Kristin: Because… so Jenny Calendar gets a sweet, sweet burn in here in the opening moments of the episode, where, you know, Giles is so upset that Jenny is not telling him what they're gonna do on their date. And just sidebar here, they're very openly, like…
Jenny: Planning dates in school!
Kristin: Yeah! Just like- 'cause I went to high school where two of the teachers were starting to date.
Jenny: Oh my god, me too!
Kristin: And it was like, the hot gossip.
Jenny: Yes! The big secret.
Kristin: Everybody was, like, "do you think that they're dating?"
Jenny: Wait, were they- was one of them getting a divorce though?
Kristin: Ooh, I don't know! Maybe.
Jenny: 'Cause that was definitely-
Kristin: Actually, maybe!
Jenny: The situation at my school, which made it hotter goss.
Kristin: Yeah! Actually, I think you might be right, but regardless, it was, like- you know, we were, like, watching their every move!
Jenny: Yeah!
Kristin: You know, if he would come into her classroom, everybody would be like, [deeper voice] "ha ha ha ha ha…" You know? [Jenny laughs] So I feel like -
Jenny: Ugh, kids are such assholes.
Kristin: [laughs] Yeah. So I just feel like seeing them- seeing Jenny Calendar and Giles operate in the hallways, it just seems like the students don't care and I beg to differ with that assessment.
Jenny: Yeah, beg to diff.
Kristin: Students super care when teachers date each other.
Jenny: Uh huh, uh huh.
Kristin: Anyhow, Giles is upset because Jenny won't tell him where they're going on their secret date. [Jenny laughs] And he's like, "how am I supposed to know what to wear?" And Jenny says, "Do you own anything else?"
Jenny: Just all tweed, all the time.
Kristin: All tweed all the time, for Giles.
Jenny: I'm picturing him going swimming, going to the beach, you know, in like… well, I guess what- I was trying to think about, like, tweed swim trunks [Kristin laughs] but I feel like he just wears one of those one-piece black and white striped, sort of like…
Kristin: Jenny.
Jenny: Like, if you picture a StrongMan.
Kristin: Jenny?
Jenny: What?
Kristin: I don't mean to take you off course here, but Giles does not go to the beach!
Jenny: [laughing] Oh yeah.
Kristin: [laughing] Come on!
Jenny: No, but like what if he has to for-
Kristin: No.
Jenny: Research…
Kristin: Giles- literally, he would go in his tweed suit.
Jenny: With a parasol?
Kristin: With a parasol. Yes, and his fucking green mug, which we still haven't seen but one day, we will.
Jenny: [sings] One day!
Kristin: I can't wait. Oh my god, I don't even know when the first appearance is. It's gonna take us by surprise. I'm gonna scream. [Jenny chuckles] I'm gonna scream so loud when I see it for the first time. Anyhow, so this, you know, fun moment between Jenny Calendar and Giles passes and we cut to class. There's so much going on in this classroom.
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kristin: Willow and Buffy are passing notes to each other. Your standard high school, you know, fodder here- passing notes, except for their notes are, [laughing] like, "was she pretty? Vampire, question mark?" Which is hysterical.
Jenny: [laughs] Yeah.
Kristin: And Cordelia and Xander are sitting across from each other. Xander is wearing this, like, incredible red, shiny-
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kristin: Adidas, with the stripes down the side.
Jenny: I'm glad that you brought this up.
Kristin: I am glad that I brought it up too.
Jenny: Because he's also wearing Salvation Army, like, plaid old man pants.
Kristin: Uh huh.
Jenny: And I just wanted to say that I absolutely 100% owned and wore a variation of that outfit.
Kristin: That entire outfit?
Jenny: That combination together. Yeah, what a great idea! Let me just wear this shiny Adidas jersey.
Kristin: [laughing] Yeah!
Jenny: With these old, like, herringbone [laughter], fucking grandpa pants.
Kristin: Hey, we were reinventing the wheel, Jenny.
Jenny: Right, yeah. That's what we were doing.
Kristin: We were making a name for ourself, and it was the kids of the 90s, what the hell were they thinking? [laughs]
Jenny: And a hemp necklace-
Kristin: Oh, yeah.
Jenny: And a pair of Airwalks.
Kristin: I had many hemp necklaces.
Jenny: Me too!
Kristin: I actually- I adopted my cat-
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kristin: In 2001. I named him Trey, after Trey from the band Phish.
Jenny: This is so embarrassing.
Kristin: And had my girlfriend make him a hemp collar! So there's some factual information [Jenny laughs] about my life and my past. Anyhow. Cordelia. This is, I think, the only time we see Cordelia in this episode? It's not a very Cordy-heavy-
Jenny: No, I think that's her only moment.
Kristin: I think it's her only moment, but it is quite a moment.
Jenny: She leaves an impression.
Kristin: She does. She is defending Marie Antoinette. [Jenny makes a nervous sound] And what's really special, is that she's very confused. She's very confused about Marie Antoinette, and what Marie Antoinette was about, and Marie Antoinette is a complicated figure. We did some reading on Marie Antoinette.
Jenny: Mm-hm.
Kristin: And there's a lot, you know, is it Marie Antoinette? Is it the patriarchy? Is it a combination of both? I can't believe you didn't shout "the patriarchy!"
Jenny: [yells] The patriarchy! [Kristin laughs] Sorry, sorry, I was just so entranced-
Kristin: By my speech?
Jenny: Listening to you talk.
Kristin: But the one thing we do know is that falsely as it may be attributed to Marie Antoinette, this quote, "let them eat cake," that Cordelia references by saying, [imitating Cordelia] "I mean, she at least let them eat cake."
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kristin: Is really underlining something here, which is- so the quote "let them eat cake" is attributed to, right, that the poor people in France- it was told to Marie Antoinette the poor people in France didn't have any bread. And she was like, "well, why not let them eat brioche then?" And, like, first of all, I don't- what we read says that that quote actually wasn't even really Marie Antoinette, blah blah blah blah blah.
Jenny: Uh huh, uh huh.
Kristin: But the context of it is this, is that, you know, she's so tone deaf to the circumstances of people living in poverty that it doesn't occur to her that they don't have bread because they are poor. She just thinks, oh well, if they don't have bread, then give them something else! Give them cake, or brioche.
Jenny: Right.
Kristin: Or whatever, in the translation it was.
Jenny: Also, isn't brioche just bread?
Kristin: No, brioche is delicious bread!
Jenny: Well, yeah, but it's like, of the bread family.
Kristin: But it's fancy bread.
Jenny: Oooh, right right right right.
Kristin: Which I think where the dichotomy is, right?
Jenny: Fancy bread.
Kristin: Like, oh, they don't have regular bread? Give 'em fancy bread! Like, it doesn't occur to, you know, Marie Antoinette, or whoever in this quote, that- how poverty affects people. She's totally clueless.
Jenny: Mhm, mhm.
Kristin: And so the fact that [laughs] then Cordelia, adding a layer to this cake- ha, ha, ha!
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kristin: Cordelia is misinterpreting that thing, right, on top of itself, thinking "but she gave them cake," is underlining some of Cordelia's, you know, lack of awareness around the situation in France at the time, the situation in her life oftentimes-
Jenny: Right, right, right.
Kristin: You know, what people do and do not have access to. And I think that is a really important Cordelia thing to just keep our eyes on. Because, you know, Cordelia- we love her for many reasons, but this moment is pointed.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I wish we had time for you to read all those Wikipedia articles you read aloud to me. [Kristin laughs] In the kitchen.
Kristin: Stay tuned for our side podcast "Kristin reads Wikipedia Articles on Marie Antoinette." [laughter] So yeah, so anyway, Cordelia, thank you for your presence, but we are not giving you a jingle this week.
Jenny: No, no, no.
Kristin: We need you to brush up on your history.
Jenny: Please.
Kristin: Just a wee bit.
Jenny: But also… well, I don't really know enough about Marie Antoinette to really posit something. But I'm just wondering, like, Marie Antoinette was not the only person in power at that exact moment. She became queen when she married Louis the [mutters exaggeratedly].
Kristin: Yes. I think 16th.
Jenny: Yeah, I thought so, too.
Kristin: Which sounded like what you censored yourself saying, yeah.
Jenny: Right, yeah. Cool, cool, cool. So, like, why doesn't he get the flack? [yells] Is it because of the patriarchy?!
Kristin: Well, and that's the thing! That's the thing with Marie Antoinette, is that, you know, it seems like a lot of things point to her really being the scapegoat, if you will, for the French Revolution. That, you know, when Marie Antoinette was beheaded, it was much more about the symbolism-
Jenny: Right, right, right.
Kristin: Of that, that kind of processing, the spending she would, you know, that she purportedly did, and her lack of awareness and what have you, that she was really killed as a symbol of what was dying as a result of the French Revolution, which of course is tied into the patriarchy. Why not Louis XVI? Why not a million other people who are participating in this. But-
Jenny: Do you know what I think?
Kristin: What do you think?
Jenny: We are gonna get so many long emails. [Kristin laughs] And I'm really excited.
Kristin: I know, 'cause we, like, read two Wikipedia articles on Marie Antoinette and certainly-
Jenny: We're like, "well, actually…"
Kristin: [laughs] Yeah. Everyone's like-
Jenny: And so, please let us know your thoughts.
Kristin: Yeah, please!
Jenny: I'm sure there is at least one Marie Antoinette or French Revolution scholar who listens to this podcast.
Kristin: Who's like, "oh, brother."
Jenny: And they've just been waiting for this episode.
Kristin: [laughs] They thought Cordelia was bad until we opened our mouths.
Jenny: Yeah. [laughter]
Kristin: Anyhow. We have- speaking of problematic things, Xander has some moments here.
Jenny: Oh geez. Ford shows up-
Kristin: Right. That's the trigger.
Jenny: That's what prompts it.
Kristin: Mhm, that's Xander's trigger. You know, we know by now that Xander loves Buffy and any threat to his relationship to Buffy- which he knows he doesn't really have a shot at, but he just holds out this hope- is going to trigger him to, typically, do some things that are kind of fucked up.
Jenny: Mhm.
Kristin: And he does, he does. First of all, before Ford shows up, they're talking- I can't remember what they're talking about, but he's like, "gives him a happy." Something-
Jenny: Ohh, he said when Angel does bad things or something-
Kristin: Oh, so similar context. Yeah, when Angel does something bad, it gives Xander a happy. Now-
Jenny: Gross!
Kristin: I don't know about you, but I would like to put out a ban- [laughter] on anyone saying that.
Jenny: "Gives me a happy."
Kristin: No, thank you.
Jenny: I was just giving- I was just cementing the example.
Kristin: Right. We do get to see Xander dancing, which I'm-
Jenny: [yells] Oh, god!
Kristin: It's like, I hate it [Jenny laughs] so much, I love it.
Jenny: Yeah. It's so bad-good.
Kristin: I really do, I really love when Xander dances. But then Xander makes this comment, after Ford is there and Buffy is, kind of all over Ford. It's a little weird.
Jenny: Oh my god, instantaneous. It's so- it just feels, like, not her.
Kristin: Yeah, because they're, like, immediately holding hands and she's, like, linking arms with him-
Jenny: Yeah. "I had such a crush on you, I moped over you for weeks."
Kristin: Yeah. It's like a whole-
Jenny: They're laying it on really thick!
Kristin: But I think, perhaps, some of the motivation for this is that she's just come off of seeing Angel-
Jenny: Yeah…
Kristin: And Drusilla, so she's like really acting out-
Jenny: Trying to make herself feel better. Mm-hm, mm-hmm.
Kristin: Yeah, yeah. Because it doesn't seem like Buffy at all. Anyhow, Xander makes this comment when they walk away.
Jenny: Ugh.
Kristin: "Doesn't she know- geez, doesn't she know any fat guys?" Which is-
Jenny: [yells] Ughhh!
Kristin: Super shitty, super fat shaming of Xander and, you know, and falls in line with some of the other stuff that we've called Xander out on. And that we've called out more than just Xander on, when it comes to being crappy to people who don't fit a particular mould that you have in your mind of who Buffy might be attracted to-
Jenny: Mhm.
Kristin: Or want to hold hands with, or link elbows with.
Jenny: [chuckles] Link elbows with.
Kristin: So Xander…
Jenny: Come on, man. Should we have a Xander shame jingle?
Kristin: [laughing] Ohhh, no!
Jenny: No, no, no. We have enough jingles.
Kristin: Xander, come on.
Jenny: We have enough jingles, we have enough jingles.
Kristin: Xander, come on man. Oh man, okay, well, we'll see what happens.
NOTES: [laughter]
Jenny: Also, there's that great moment where Buffy has revealed that she- while she was moping, she listened to the Divinyls' song, "I Touch Myself."
Kristin: [laughs] Yes.
Jenny: And, 45 to 60 seconds later, Willow has an awakening moment where she realizes, "oh, that's what that song was about."
Kristin: Yes.
Jenny: Which is nice.
Kristin: Which is nice, and this was very believable to me. I don't think that, like, I knew what masturbation was until I was in high school. Like, I didn't- you know what I mean?
Jenny: Yeah!
Kristin: So this added up to me that, like, they would be, like, "Ohh, that's what that song meant." In fifth grade, you were, like, you know- you thought it was inappropriate and silly and kind of sexy, but you didn't really know-
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: What it meant. You thought, like, maybe they were like touching their skin and like, dancing sexily…
Jenny: [laughing] Kristin is- has her hand [Kristin laughs] pressed to her clavicles right now, just FYI. [laughs] That's what's going on here. Uhh, yeah, this is just making me think about, like, kissing your pillow-
Kristin: Right.
Jenny: And, like, that thing everybody would do where you wrap your arms all the way around you so it looks like somebody's hands are holding your back.
Kristin: Yeah. Exactly!
Jenny: And you're making out with them.
Kristin: Right! [Jenny laughs] It was like what sex was when you were a kid, if you were- especially if you grew up in the 90s, but unfortunately, still if you grow up now. People don't really talk about sex or masturbation or bodies to young people, and so we're all just left kissing our pillows.
Jenny: Aww.
Kristin: And finding out, later on in life, that the songs we'd been singing loudly, and with passion, have been actually meaning, "when I think about you, I masturbate all the time."
Jenny: Hooray! [Kristin laughs] So… Xander changes his outfit for the Bronze. He's now wearing a brown shirt-jacket with some contrast stitching, you may remember from the 90s, and now. And, like, a white T-shirt and some, like, regular pants that aren't plaid. Better look.
Kristin: And this is the Xander, the jealous Xander, that I like. [Jenny bursts out laughing in agreement] I'm suuuper down with-
Jenny: With the, [imitating Xander] "you're not wrong!" The "you're not wrong" refrain.
Kristin: Yes, like Xander- and I think that underlines this point, that, like, you can be jealous and have feelings, and actually be hilarious.
Jenny: Yeah. Yes! Exactly, totally.
Kristin: You know?
Jenny: Because this is a great, great moment for him.
Kristin: Yeah. 'Cause Ford of course is like, you know, "oh, he seems older." [laughing] "You're not wrong!"
Jenny: [laughs] Cold hands!
Kristin and Jenny: "You're not wrong!"
Kristin: [laughs] Yeah. Really, really good.
Jenny: Also, this velvet shirt on Angel-
Kristin: Ohh god.
Jenny: We were wondering aloud, did he wear this last week or the week before or something, or am I just… maybe he wears it in a later episode that we did a Buffy Watch of.
Kristin: That we did a Buffy Watch- yeah, that's what I was thinking. That's what throws me off, actually, in remembering, did that happen already, is that sometimes we've watched an episode forward, and I'm like, ohhh.
Jenny: But that deeply patterned-
Kristin: Oh my god.
Jenny: Crop circle, velvet shirt. Good gravy.
Kristin: You know, my ex-girl- when I started dating my ex-girlfriend, like, probably a month or two into dating, she was like, "can you help me clean out my closet?" [Jenny laughs] And I swear, I swear to you, that she had, like, at least three of the Angel shirts.
Jenny: Jen?!
Kristin: Yes.
Jenny: Listen.
Kristin: Called out!
Jenny: Kristin's ex, Jen, my favorite person [yells] on the planet.
Kristin: [laughing] She liked her polyester, she liked her fancy, button-y shirts.
Jenny: [whispers] God! What a lady.
Kristin: She was really holding tight to that. But yeah, so okay, then Angel lies, right? This is when we get, I guess- well, no, it's not our first lie. It's our second lie because Ford has lied to Buffy, right.
Jenny: Said he's matriculating.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: [yells] Lie!
Kristin: Lies! But we get this moment between Angel and Buffy where she asks him what he was doing and he says, "I did nothing, I was just home reading." And she's like, oh. Fuck. And I get like a pit in my stomach in this moment 'cause I know- you know that feeling. I think most of us know that feeling of-
Jenny: When you know somebody's lying to you?
Kristin: Yes! [Jenny makes uncomfortable noises] It's a horrible feeling. Oh my god, it just made me think of The Jinx.
Jenny: Ugh!
Kristin: The worst of all. The worst of all.
Jenny: Dear lord.
Kristin: Which I won't- if you haven't watched that, please, go and watch it. It's upsetting but it's necessary. Okay, anyway. So this lie happens, and she's like, "I'm fuckin' outta here." She takes Ford, they go on a walk. You know, whatever. It's like, I know that is a major plot point, but I don't really care about it very much. She slays a vampire-
Jenny: Well, I think it's important-
Kristin: You talk about it.
Jenny: To just mention, they're just taking a nice stroll down one of Sunnydale's premier creepy dark alleys in the warehouse district.
Kristin: Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh.
Jenny: And Buffy realizes she has to slay a vampire so she tries to distract Ford, and asks him to go get her purse-
Kristin: Run! [laughs]
Jenny: Run. And then, while she's slaying the vampire, and then Ford comes up, and is like, "what happened?" And she's like, "a cat!" [Kristin laughs] "And another cat!" Great cover story.
Kristin: Yeah, that's true, that is really good.
Jenny: See, this is Buffy lying.
Kristin: Yeah, Buffy-
Jenny: [laughing] And doing a bang-up job.
Kristin: And only to be topped soon by Willow.
Jenny: By Willow. Oh my god.
Kristin: Which we will get to.
Jenny: And then Ford reveals that he knows she's the slayer. They don't get into any details whatsoever about it, why he knows what a slayer is, how he found out, none of that, which seems odd.
Kristin: No, it's sort of like, "well, I was at your last school and I put the pieces together." It's like, what? Don't you know how this show works? Nobody puts the pieces together. That's not how it works. Anyhow, later-
Jenny: [laughs] So later in Willow's room…
Kristin: Buffy and Willow are on the phone and this brought me so much nostalgia. Buffy's phone, especially. Buffy's cordless white plastic phone that she has cradled between her shoulder and her ear, it gave me all these flashbacks to my ear, my one ear being, like, bright fucking red-
Jenny: Being like, smashed.
Kristin: So hot from having been on the phone for just hours upon hours upon hours with my friends. And then Willow-
Jenny: Oh my god. Laying on her stomach on her bed with her fucking knees bent and her fucking elephant slipper feet!
Kristin: Yeah, she's adorable.
Jenny: Flapping in the breeze.
Kristin: With this long sleeve Ringer T-shirt nightgown.
Jenny: Yes! Ideal, ideal nightshirt.
Kristin: So cute, Willow, so cute.
Jenny: Great job.
Kristin: And then, who comes to the door?
Jenny: Rap tap tap, fucking… Angel-
Kristin: Angel!
Jenny: Vampire fives delivery service.
Kristin: Theirs is a forbidden love.
Jenny: Theirs is a forbidden love.
Kristin: As Willow says later.
Jenny: He has- he needs her to track some stuff down on the 'net.
Kristin: On the net.
Jenny: He doesn't even know what he's looking for, but he's looking for something, anything weird. And it turns out, there's weird stuff right away [Kristin chuckles] when Willow Googles?
Kristin: No, there was no Google.
Jenny: When Willow… web searches?
Kristin: She probably asked Jeeves. [laughs]
Jenny: Oh my god. Willow looks online at the school records and sees that Ford is not listed anywhere.
Kristin: Right, right. And Willow, this is an important- there's a lot of shit in this episode. This episode really contains a lot of important character moments.
Jenny: Like Willow frantically hiding her bra?
Kristin: [laughing] Yes. Yes, like that.
Jenny: I'm with you Willow. That's my vibe.
Kristin: That is a total Jenny move.
Jenny: Yes.
Kristin: God forbid a person of any gender were to see the undergarment-
Jenny: Heavens-
Kristin: Of Jenny Owen You- Jenny Owen Youngs does not wear undergarments!
Jenny: No, I'm like a Barbie doll under here, it's just all plastic. [Kristin laughs] Plastic and smooth.
Kristin: But this-
Jenny: But with real-life proportions, obviously, because a Barbie is not real-life proportions. 'Kay.
Kristin: You good?
Jenny: Sorry, I just didn't want anybody to think for one-
Kristin: Do you want to whisper the patriarchy?
Jenny: [whispers] The patriarchy.
Kristin: [laughs] But Angel and Willow have this exchange where Willow is like, "I'll look for you, but I have something to say." And Angel, being 241, is like, "I know. You think I might be jealous and like, I get it, but I'm not and this is why I'm not." But he has this little monologue where he talks about the fact that he historically has not been a very jealous person, that for the hundred years he really just moped around feeling very guilty-
Jenny: Woo, feel that! Feel that.
Kristin: Yeah, he really honed his brooding skills.
Jenny: Well…
Kristin: Oh, you don't feel that as much?
Jenny: I don't feel that, I just feel like- feeling guilty, not being jealous. Yeah.
Kristin: Right, right, right. And then to end this scene, Willow's mom is like, "Willow!" or whatever and she says-
Jenny: Like a Cathy cartoon come to life!
Kristin: "Ack!" She says the word "ack" and I fucking love you, Alyson Hannigan, for your ability to deliver "ack" via Willow. I mean, this is Willow, right?
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: She's one of the only people who could say "ack" out loud and you're like, yep. That's believable.
Jenny: Yes, exactly.
Kristin: That's 100% believable. Also, we skipped over-
Jenny: Oh my god, the Sunset Club?
Kristin: Yeah, the Sunset Club. [laughing] Also, the name. The Sunset Club, you guys.
Jenny: Yeah, it does sound- well, it sounds really L.A. or something.
Kristin: It sounds like [singing] "midnight at the Oasis."
Jenny: Where's the Oasis, Las Vegas?
Kristin: I don't know, just-
Jenny: It just exists in the song?
Kristin: If you told me that we were gonna go on a date to the Sunset Club, I'd be like-
Jenny: You'd be like, "do I need to help you clean all the polyester and velvet shirts out of your closet?"
Kristin: Yeah, I'd be really excited for the umbrellas that were gonna be in my cocktails, you know?
Jenny: Yes. Just want to mention that while Ford is talking Diego, he takes a pill that he says is Ritalin.
Kristin: Yes.
Jenny: Which we later, I think, can safely assume is not Ritalin but some kind of medication, some kind of anti-nausea or brain cancer related medication.
Kristin: But also an interesting cover, right, that you're saying Ritalin and I think another 90s- you know? This is a very 90s thing.
Jenny: Yes.
Kristin: First of all, today, it would probably be Adderall and second of all-
Jenny: Def.
Kristin: I don't know the history of Ritalin and Adderall and ADD, but I do know growing up in the 90s that that was a big fucking topic of conversation. It had to be a boom of sorts of when kids were just being diagnosed all over the place with ADD. So just a little 90s nugget.
Jenny: Nice. We also see Ford lip syncing this vampire movie which we did some quick research on.
Kristin: Very Home Alone right? [laughter] "You filthy animal", it's totally that scene.
Jenny: Yes, yes, exactly.
Kristin: But with Dracula?
Jenny: Yes so this is- depending on your source, it's either a 1973 or 1974 British television movie, Bram Stoker's Dracula. But it looks like it's been more recently rebranded as Dan Curtis' Dracula because Dan Curtis directed it and then in 1992, of course, the Bram Stoker's Dracula that Winona Ryder is in came out. So I think to separate it from that, they have rebranded it as
Dan Curtis'. Just a quick, quick note: this one was written by Richard Matheson who wrote I Am Legend, which of course, the Will Smith zombie movie was based on and directed by Dark Shadows creator, Dan Curtis. That's who Dan Curtis is. He created Dark Shadows, which I have very specific three-year-old memories of seeing Dark- like, I think my mom was watching it or just left-
Kristin: You were three? Wow.
Jenny: Yeah, not like I was watching a whole episode or anything, but I remember seeing clips of it, seeing the opening credits or whatever.
Kristin: Yeah. Cool.
Jenny: Just vampire vibes.
Kristin: All these connections. Also, a connection that I didn't mention is that Ford is played by Jason Behr and a few years later, I guess seven, eight years later, we'll see Jason Behr and Sarah Michelle Gellar together in the movie The Grudge which came out in 2004.
Jenny: Wow, I saw The Grudge in theaters.
Kristin: I think I did too, although I feel like I'm confusing The Grudge with that movie where they were on the rollercoaster and he-
Jenny: Final Destination?
Kristin: No, no, no, it's the one where the guy writes on his chest "Nicole 4 Eva" It's Nicole and then the number 4 and then "eva." Come on, it's a classic.
Jenny: I got nothing.
Kristin: Oh, maybe it's The Crush.
Jenny: The Crush, the Grudge.
Kristin: I'll find out. I'll find out and get back to you.
NOTES: [Post-production jingle plays] Post-production fact correction, Post-production fact correction!
Kristin: I was mistaken, dear listeners. The movie with the roller coaster andNicole 4 Eva" is the movie Fear, which was released in 1996 and stars Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon. Not to be confused with 1993's movie The Crush, which stars Alicia Silverstone. You can see how I might have gotten them confused. There's sexy stuff, there's dangerous stuff, there's obsession, it's the 90s? How could you know? But now you know.
NOTES: [End post-production jingle]
Jenny: Thank you.
Kristin: Anyhow, now we get to my-
Jenny: The best thing ever.
Kristin: Yeah, I think it's my favorite scene, with Willow lying. I love it so much that I recorded the audio so that we can all experience it together. Here we go.
NOTES: [Audio clip plays]
Buffy: What's up?
Willow: [nervously] Nothing.
Buffy: Do you want to hang? We're cafeteria bound.
Willow: I'm gonna do work in the computer lab on school work that I have, so I cannot hang just now. Hi, Ford.
Ford: Morning.
Buffy: Okay, Will, 'fess up.
Willow: What?
Buffy: Are you drinking coffee again? 'Cause we've talked about this.
Willow: [high-pitched nervous laughter] It makes me jumpy. I have to go… away.
NOTES: [End audio clip]
Kristin: [laughing] Oh my god! Willow.
Jenny: This is the best.
Kristin: That laugh. It's an incredible- she has one of my favorite awkward laughs of all time. There was an episode in Season 1 where she does this awkward laugh as well, that I remember. It's like, when her and Xander have their inside joke-
Jenny: Oh, yeah.
Kristin: And Buffy isn't a part of it and she's just hysterically- ugh, it's just great. It's just great.
Jenny: Also, a treasure that you can't hear in the recording is what she's doing with her arms and hands that are sort of clasped in this sort of circle. And she's kind of nervously gripping her own hands, but also kind of twisting her shoulders so that she's standing kind of like a triumphant Revolutionary War statue or something?
Kristin: Incredible acting.
Jenny: Really good.
Kristin: Incredible acting by Alyson Hannigan with the sly.
Jenny: Praise.
Kristin: And then this is the moment where Giles comes in and is like, [imitating Giles] "Buh-buh-uh, but Buffy, I-" [Jenny laughs] You know, he's panicked because he might be taking a night off to have a good time with a woman that he likes.
Jenny: Uh-huh. But don't worry, she has a beeper thing. Here's the number.
Kristin: Here's the number and he has- if you want to know what it's like to have a conversation with my wife, pay attention to the moment where Buffy says "go have fun." And Giles has at least three seconds before the scene ends where he looks at Buffy, and then he looks away, and then he looks at Buffy, and he thinks, and then he looks away and he thinks, and then he looks back at Buffy and then he walks out the door. I was like, if that is not you- I mean, it's Jenny. That's the Jenny way. The Jenny way is the Giles way.
Jenny: Wow. So much me in this episode.
Kristin: Yeah, I see a lot of you in a lot of these characters. Ugh, then fucking Ford and Buffy on their date or whatever the hell this is.
Jenny: Whatever it is [makes a spitting sound]- blegh.
Kristin: First of all, Ford starts off by saying, "is that more vampires?" Um, it's are those more vampires, Ford. Maybe you should talk better. And for seconds, he has a fucking stake with him? I hate this guy.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: I don't like him. I don't like him one bit. I don't know what he's about, that he fucking lies.
Jenny: He presumes too much, he lies.
Kristin: He corners this vampire and says, "give me the information now." Here's where I need to stop us. Because what the fuck is with Ford? Like, who are his parents? What do they think? Has he run away? They have a sick kid, right? They have a sick kid who has left Los Angeles and is just gone and missing. And I'm gonna follow the arc all the way through here. He has found a bomb shelter to build a thing in. I'm assuming that Diego has funded it, because Diego seems very huffy and is like, "the lease is up on this place man, what are we going to do after that?" So I don't- the mechanics or the backstory on Ford is really shaky for me. Where is he getting the funding and where is he getting the information? How the fuck does he know about Spike and that he needs to know how to get- it took the Scoobies this whole time to fi- Spike- just come on. I don't understand how this kid is so strong and how this kid is so knowledgeable and how this kid has just run away from home and no one is looking for him.
Jenny: Yeah…
Kristin: I just don't know and then- whatever. I'm taking this to the end and we'll talk about this in a more serious way. But like, then he dies and is buried in Sunnydale?! Why don't-
Jenny: Right.
Kristin: Come on. You guys…
Jenny: Where are his parents?
Kristin: Where are his- where's his family or anyone that he knew in his past life?
Jenny: Yeah…
Kristin: Just, so anyway.
Jenny: Mysteries abound.
Kristin: My issue- that's my issue with Ford, the character.
Jenny: Okay, then we have Xander, Angel, and Willow. Together.
Kristin: Ugh! The dream team.
Jenny: So good.
Kristin: And this is really the first time we're seeing them- I mean, especially with- we've seen Angel and Xander have their thing.
Jenny: Uh huh.
Kristin: Lots of sexual tension awards have gone in their direction.
Jenny: Praise.
Kristin: But Willow has not really had a standalone relationship with Angel and certainly them as a trio… this is new territory for them.
Jenny: Yeah. And it's great. And Xander and Angel have this wonderful old married couple moment, where Xander calls Angel "dead boy" and Angel says, "Could you not call me that?" So huffy, the best.
Kristin: Yeah. So mad, so mad.
Jenny: Xander and Willow: Not. Dressed. For the Sunset Club.
Kristin: No, they're not and that's how Chan- Chanterelle?
Jenny: Yes, Chanterelle.
Kristin: Chanterelle spots them immediately and says, "oh you're new, I can tell you're new. Don't be ashamed." She's so sweet.
Jenny: She is so nice even when Angel is like, [imitating Angel] "You're a fool." She's like, [high-pitched] "Have an open mind, I'm really sweet."
Kristin: This is- but you know, this is a triggering thing for me. This is really- this moment to me reminded me a lot of conversations that I've had with my extended family members.
Jenny: Ahh.
Kristin: About things like, you know, abortion rights and so on and so forth, where- and this election- where, you know, they've been so nice but also- 'cause the setup is Angel is really mean and she is really nice. So you kind of feel for her. But the truth of the matter is that Angel holds the knowledge that she's about to- like, she's gonna fucking get killed.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: She has no idea what she's talking about.
Jenny: He's in touch with reality and she's not.
Kristin: Exactly. And she has this line that I wrote down. "You don't have to be so cruel about it. Other viewpoints than your own could be valid, you know." And it's a trigger for me, because this is what everybody has fucking told me on the other side of the line for the last however many months. "Hey, agree to disagree" and it's like, no! You're putting me at risk, you're putting yourselves at risk. What is the tweet that you loved so much that's about-
Jenny: [laughing] Oh my god.
Kristin: Can you say what it is?
Jenny: It was something to the effect of: "I never thought jaguars wouldeat my face: quote attributed to woman who voted for Jaguars Eating People's Faces Party 2016."
Kristin: [laughs] Right, right. You're like- I see that I'm in danger, I see that you could even be in danger. I'm trying to fucking protect you here. Don't give me this shit about- you're so- "it's just a different viewpoint, don't be so cruel." Like, there are reasons I think that- whatever. I won't lose it over it, but I was like, wow, this is really capturing something here. Because she's totally clueless. She really- she has no idea what she's talking about but she believes so deep-
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Like, she believes so completely in it.
Jenny: In the lonely ones?
Kristin: And it's devastating to see the moment when she realizes [Jenny sighs] that she was wrong. It really is so sad when she sees Spike and she recognizes instantly that-
Jenny: She's like "oh fuck."
Kristin: Everything that she thought was true was not true. Anyway, not to go off on too much of a rant there, but it was a very poignant moment for me.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: And yeah, the lonely ones.
Jenny: The lonely ones.
Kristin: The lonely ones.
Jenny: Immediately followed by this fantastic moment where Angel's going off. [Kristin laughs] He's like, I've seen enough. I know this kind of people, they've made up these fantasy stories about how vampires are friendly, they don't know anything about how vampires really are or what they do or how they dress. And as he says "how they dress," a guy who has just descended the stairs wearing the exact same outfit as Angel-
Kristin: [laughing] It's so good.
Jenny: Sort of passes between him and one of the Scoobies.
Kristin: Xander gets a big kick out of it. [Jenny laughs] It's a really good moment.
Jenny: It's really great.
Kristin: And you know, something that must happen in the next scene is really important, which is that we know Drusilla, we've known Drusilla for a few episodes now-
Jenny: Yeah, yeah.
Kristin: But this is the first episode where Buffy and the Scooby Gang in general learns about Drusilla and about the fact that Drusilla is alive. Because Giles had thought her dead based on the mythology and the- whatever, his books.
Jenny: Right, angry mob in Prague.
Kristin: What a- yeah, angry mob in Prague. [Jenny laughs] So yeah, I think that's a big deal and Buffy sees this photo- beautiful derogatype [sp]? What is that called?
Jenny: Wow!
Kristin: Right, isn't that- I don't know. It's one of those moments where-
Jenny: I think it's dagu-dagu-
Kristin: Daguerreotype?
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah, derogatype sounds like it's a bad picture-
Jenny: Right right right.
Kristin: A picture that's not representative of the person who is in it. Anyway…
Jenny: She looks great.
Kristin: It's a nice photo. And we learn- and I'm skipping a little ahead here but I think it fits with this- we learn Drusilla's backstory and as it relates to Angel.
Jenny: Yes.
Kristin: This is a big fucking deal. BFD, guys. Angel confesses or whatever you want to call it to Buffy, that he was- you know, he was really obsessed with Drusilla, her purity, her chasteness. And that not only did he sire her, but he drove her insane by killing everyone that she loved, sending her literally to a nunnery and then on the day that she was supposed to become a nun, turned her into a demon.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: So this is important and this- and it's important for a lot of reasons and it will continue to be important. But I think it's clarifying if you're just watching now, in terms of why Angel would let Drusilla in that moment on the playground.
Jenny: Right, right. Guilt, guilt, guilt.
Kristin: So much guilt. Like, he knows that vampires are bad. But also, he knows the reason that Drusilla is crazy and a vampire is all because of his actions. And there's one of these moments, and we'll talk about this more aswe get towards the end of the episode, but one of these things where: how do you know what is good and what is bad? Things are fucking complicated.
Jenny: Mhmm.
Kristin: Drusilla is not just evil. Drusilla had a life, she had everyone that she loved taken away from her. You know? It's complicated, it's really complicated.
Jenny: You know what else is complicated?
Kristin: What else?
Jenny: The back door of the Summers' house is always cracked!
Kristin: It is, it's true.
Jenny: It's always open! [Kristin laughs] Listen, I live in Southern California and everyone's like, "oh, there's no bugs compared to the East Coast," whatever. There's not, like, a neverending cloud of mosquitoes that you have to wade through, say, in the summer. But if we leave the door of our house open-
Kristin: One loud fly always gets in.
Jenny: Immediately.
Kristin: Immediately.
Jenny: So there's- I'm not buying the Summers' house leaving the door cracked, especially when it's dark outside, it's light inside-
Kristin: Especially with that fruit bowl.
Jenny: [laughing] And the fruit bowl.
Kristin: Can we talk about the fruit bowl for just a hot second?
Jenny: One of every- it's like the half of a fruit ark.
Kristin: Yeah, it's like they were like, "what should we put"- the set designer was like, "we need a fruit bowl. Should it be bananas, apples, pears, kiwis?" And they were like, put one of everything! [laughter] Just go for it. Also, let us not forget-
Jenny: Oh my god.
Kristin: In the library scene, it is revealed what Giles has been doing with his time this evening with Jenny Calendar. [Jenny laughs] He has been at a fucking monster truck rally.
Jenny: Hell yeah!
Kristin: Whoever you are- if it was you, Joss, I give you all the credit. If it was another writer in the room- whoever it was who was like, "I know".
Jenny: That's exactly what Jenny Calendar wants to do in her spare time.
Kristin: And it's exactly where every single person who watches this show wants to imagine Giles. [Jenny laughs] You know? It's just great.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: And then, so Giles- if it's okay, we'll go back to the library for a second.
Jenny: Yeah, yes.
Kristin: Because Giles is- right, monster trucks, Drusilla, we see the picture. But then this vampire, who Ford has said he has killed, runs through the library, steals a book, and runs out the library. But by the way, the library has so many ways to get in and out.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: They should work on that, they know what they're up against. Don't you think that they should-
Jenny: Yeah, narrow down the ins and outs.
Kristin: Yeah. But Giles is incensed. He's so-
Jenny: "My book!"
Kristin: [laughing] "My book, they took one of my books." It's just…
Jenny: He's so bummed. And I get that.
Kristin: So good. Yeah, I get it too.
Jenny: Also, Jenny Calendar's reaction shot to the vampire, so dramatic.
Kristin: So dramatic. Speaking of dramatic, I believe we then go to Spike's lair or whatever we're calling it.
Jenny: Uh huh.
Kristin: Drusilla is talking to this bird. [laughter] I just- if I hadn't already given her the jingle earlier, we'd give it to her again right now because she just wants the bird to live. Why is the bird not talking to her, why is the bird not standing up on its two little bird feet?
Jenny: Uh huh.
Kristin: She doesn't get it, and Spike has this moment with her that is- oh god, I love their love. I love their- you know what, maybe we should stop and do a Sexual Tension Award while I'm talking about loving their love?
Jenny: Is it a three-way sexual tension award between Drusilla, Spike, and the bird?
Kristin: And the bird. Well, I don't know. I think for it to be a three-way, the passion has to be felt in a triangulated way…
Jenny: I can confirm that that is not… necessary.
Kristin: [laughing] For- what are you inferring?!
Jenny: Nothing, gotta go!
Kristin: [laughing] Alright, well if you're not gonna give us the reasoning, I'll just have to believe you.
Jenny: I just feel like there could be three people-
Kristin: Uh huh.
Jenny: And in order for them to all [Kristin laughs] earn a sexual tension award together, they don't necessarily need to feel the attraction in equal measure in all directions.
Kristin: Okay, and actually, maybe it adds to the sexual tension award that Spike feels a deep disdain towards the bird.
Jenny: Right, right. Twisted.
Kristin: Yeah, very twisted. Very Spike and Drusilla. Alright, Jenny. [laughter] Since you've revealed some personal aspects of your life-
Jenny: What?! No, no, no.
Kristin: To get us here to this Sexual Tension Award, I'll give it to you and to Spike, the bird, and Drusilla.
Jenny: Then we've got this ridiculously bright sunshiny school campus shot where Buffy's like, [whistling sound] and Ford's like, [stomping sound]-
Kristin: [laughing] Yeah.
Jenny: And he's like, "Buffy, got any plans tonight?" and she's like, "none that I know of" and he's like, "meet me" and she's like, "when?"
Kristin: And the camera- the camera's spinning around.
Jenny: Just like relax!
Kristin: It's a very- and I don't even know if this is accurate, but it reminded me of I Know What You Did Last Summer?
Jenny: Yes!
Kristin: Right? Which has just happened.
Jenny: Right, it just reminded me of any- like, Scream, any teen horror-
Kristin: But that spinny camera move, because you know, what's incredible about camera angles and cinematography in general is that if they had acted this scene and the lighting had been different and the cameras had been different, it would not have had that feeling at all. They really- the way they deliver the lines to each other is pretty mono- not monotone, but there's not a lot of creepiness inherent in the way they're talking to each other. It's much more communicated by the camera spinning and the lighting being very severe-
Jenny: And the music.
Kristin: And the music, exactly. So yes, they set a time to meet, it's like a showdown. You know? "See you here at nine," except that they're pretending it's date two.
Jenny: Uh huh. But instead, Buffy goes to the Sunset Club around 6:25pmand then the sun sets at around 6:27pm.
Kristin: [laughing] 6:27.
Jenny: Perfect timing!
Kristin: She should really think about these things, like, you know…
Jenny: Oh, yeah.
Kristin: I know she's got a lot on her mind, but she knows that she operates- you know, she has a particular- I guess she has school though. School really cuts into when she can be doing a lot of this work safely, 'cause the vampires can't come out. Something we skipped over because we talked about Drusilla's backstory as a separate thing, is this moment between- [Jenny inhales sharply] Angel and Buffy. This is a really good underline to the complicated nature of their relationship, because they don't get to have the moment that many of us have in our relationships where we say "I love you" for the first time and it's simple. I mean, it's never simple, but at least it's usually just rooted in being in love. This is not that. Angel says, "do you love me?"
Jenny: 'Cause I have to tell you something terrible.
Kristin: Right, and Buffy says, "I love you. I don't know if I trust you." So this is like-
Jenny: And he's like, "maybe you shouldn't do either."
Kristin: Wow. Loaded, it's loaded. It's a hefty moment, you know?
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: And it's a big moment, I think saying- everyone knows, I think, that saying "I love you" to someone for the first time is a pretty loaded moment.
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Do you remember when I said-
Jenny: [awkwardly] Up bup bup bup bup.
Kristin: Do you remember? Do you remember? Do you remember?
Jenny: Bup bup bup. Moving right along.
Kristin: That's how it went, too. That was how- [laughter]
Jenny: Kristin was like, "I love you" and I was like, [loudly] "Uhhhhh…"
Kristin: That's not true, she said "I love you" back.
Jenny: Okay!
Kristin: And it was in London.
Jenny: Oh my god!
Kristin: [yelling] And it was great!
Jenny: Enough! [Kristin laughs] Enough, woman!
Kristin: You're all-
Jenny: This is nobody's business!
Kristin: You're all welcome. This was so much fun for me and I think so much fun for you at home.
Jenny: That's why you wanted to include this part of the episode.
Kristin: No, I didn't even think- I didn't think of it until right now.
Jenny: Ugh, I felt it coming from a mile away. [Kristin laughs] I was like, how long is it going to take her to get around…
Kristin: [laughs] And it's great 'cause you can't go anywhere. You got headphones on, you're wired to the spot.
Jenny: I hate you.
Kristin: You're stuck, it's great. I've got a lot of power in this podcasting world of ours.
Jenny: Anyway.
Kristin: Anyway. Oh! The other thing that I wanted to say about this scene, which I think is important in a set kind of way, is the scene between Buffy and Angel ends with this shot from outside the house through a curtain and they're sitting at the dining room table.
Jenny: Beautiful.
Kristin: It's a beautiful shot and it may be- it's either the first time or one of the first times that we've seen the dining room table from outside in this way and that spot in Buffy's house is a very important spot. It's a very powerful spot, at least in my one time through the season, that that's a very meaningful place and so- you know, I think establishing, establishing, establishing.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah.
Kristin: So on and so forth. So anyhow, they say they love each other. No one in this room knows what that is like.
Jenny: No.
Kristin: 'Cause we have never said that to each other.
Jenny: Gross. Ugh.
Kristin: And then another chapter of lies is sort of resolved? Not really resolved though? Buffy comes into school and Willow and Xander are like-
Jenny: Right.
Kristin: "Hey, hey, Buffy…"
Jenny: "Hey…"
Kristin: "Did Angel talk to you?" And you can see that Buffy is visibly upset.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: And in the exchange, honestly, between Angel and Buffy too, she's sort of like, "this is a conspiracy, what is going on?" That feeling- I've been there before where you find out-
Jenny: All your friends are talking about something about you, without you.
Kristin: Yes. And you don't know?
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: That's a cutting thing, it really is. It goes deep and I don't think I ever had the experience of that happening when it was also surrounding somebody who I was in love with. Where like, somebody I was in love with and my friends were all on a particular page and had intentionally kept me out for better or for worse. It's hard. And then… Buffy gets locked in the dungeon.
Jenny: Locked in the dungeon. She's all like, "You're all about to be the all-you-can-eat moron bar. You don't know anything about vampires." Then Ford's like, "I have a nest of tumors liquefying my brain." [Kristin laughs] A phrase that has stuck with me since the first time I heard it.
Kristin: Yeah, which is why I laugh. Not about- I was not laughing at Ford's tumors. I was laughing at who I'm married to. [Jenny laughs] And that you know the exact phrasing of that line.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah, so there's a big plot twist here. Where, again, what is bad and what is not bad? Certainly, wanting to- and this is taking a line from Buffy, but mass murder in exchange for your own life is never justifiable. But it does add a layer of complexity to what Ford is doing here. Ford's not just after this for fun. Ford knows that he has not very long to live and so you know, it's hard. It's hard to view the character of Ford now as only bad.
Jenny: Right.
Kristin: Right? Also, there's an interesting exchange between Ford and Buffy where she says- you know, he's like, "I'm gonna become a vampire, I'm gonna become one of them" and she says, you know, "that isn't what happens. You die and a demon takes up a place in your body and remembers your life, but it is not you." And that's important. That's a piece of- I don't know if you want to call it the mythology or whatever, but I just think it's important for us to remember the way vampires are portrayed in this series as a whole-
Jenny: Right.
Kristin: When they are a vampire, they are not the person they were.
Jenny: Unless they've been re-ensouled by a curse.
Kristin: Unless they've been re-ensouled of course. [laughing] Also, so Spike gets there. Spike arrives and I always love a Spike arrival. It's always done with [Jenny laughs] lots of fanfare and the particular breed of fanfare we get in this episode is that he walks in, he looks at Chanterelle and grabs her choker and rips it off of her body. [laughter] And throws it on the floor. For no reason!
Jenny: Yeah, that's-
Kristin: No, actually- I'm sorry. I just realized that the reason of course is that he has to feed off of her.
Jenny: Yeah but like, it wasn't like the choker was taking up her whole neck. It was thick but it wasn't that thick.
Kristin: Right, his teeth would probably-
Jenny: I get it but like, oh boy.
Kristin: We watched Planet Earth the other day. We watched a tiger eating part of a deer or something and the tiger kept getting the fur in its mouth. [Jenny laughs] So I picture- Spike doesn't want that kind of humiliation, you know?
Jenny: [laughing] Yeah.
Kristin: Having a choker stuck to his tooth, it's just a little too much.
Jenny: Mmhmm, so embarrassing.
Kristin: But yeah. Then we see this moment where Chanterelle realizes "oh fuck, I've been wrong." They all realize "oh fuck."
Jenny: Yeah and then every vampire is attacking every person.
Kristin: Yeah, one per body.
Jenny: And Buffy's looking around like, "oh fuck" and then she sees, up on the balcony, one lone vampire.
Kristin: Yeah. Not smart, Spike.
Jenny: Yeah and that doesn't-
Kristin: That's just a big gap in Spike's plan.
Jenny: Yeah but it just seemed foolproof, I guess, right? And there were so many of them…
Kristin: Right. But he didn't- they didn't have- it wasn't like, you know, when you play football and you're like, "okay we're going to do this and then we're going to do that and then we're going to-" They didn't have a plan!
Jenny: Not looking ahead, right.
Kristin: Yeah, they didn't get enough steps ahead of themselves. Also, perhaps he thought that Drusilla would be okay up on the balcony and didn't realize that Buffy could fly. [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah, Buffy can jump 20 feet up in the air.
Kristin: She- that jump!
Jenny: Yeah, well you'll remember in "The Harvest," maybe, when Buffy's leaving campus and Principal Flutie's like, "Leaving campus?" and she's like, "oh no, never!" And he locks the gate and then she jumps straight up over the school fence.
Kristin: Also- yes, I remember that. I also remember the episode where we see Angel for the first time when Buffy jumps up all the way up to that pole above their heads-
Jenny: And does the handstand on the pole.
Kristin: Buffy's powerful. And of course, Buffy has Drusilla and so nothing matters, you know?
Jenny: [squealing] I love it!
Kristin: I know, I love it too. I have in all caps: "Spike loves Dru" just written in my notebook [Jenny laughs] because I- it's just amazing. Spike has goals in life, he wants to kill the slayer, it's really important to him but nothing- nothing comes close to his feelings toward Drusilla. And so Drusilla is in danger, he's like, everybody get the fuck off and get the fuck out.
Jenny: Mhmm.
Kristin: Just stop what you're doing. And Buffy, I think, knowing that she is outnumbered, makes the decision to make this move where she gets everyone, almost everyone, out to safety, throws Drusilla at Spike. Which is also interesting.
Jenny: Interesting that she doesn't just dust Drusilla?
Kristin: Dust Drusilla, leave, and close the door, right?
Jenny: I think- you know what I think? I was thinking about this. I think it was like, if she dusted Drusilla, she would have lost the time she'd need to get out the door and close it.
Kristin: To get out the door? I thought maybe it had something to do- because Spike and Buffy are establishing a relationship.
Jenny: Uh huh.
Kristin: And I did feel that maybe it had to do with the fact that she said 'if you do this thing for me, I will do this thing for you-
Jenny: Right.
Kristin: And if she had dusted Drusilla, it would have broken all manner of trust between them? Which sounds weird.
Jenny: Yeah, but she didn't lie.
Kristin: Oh, snap.
Jenny: She did. Not. Lie.
Kristin: She did not lie. And so she gets out, but she leaves Ford behind.
Jenny: So this is, like, the first time…
Kristin: Yeah, I mean, it's the first time that Buffy has some influence in a human being dying.
Jenny: Well, there are people she hasn't been able to save, right?
Kristin: Right, right. But this is the first time that it's very clear that she made the decision to leave him in there and it's- again, here's another one of these fucking moments that's super layered. Because he says- Ford says in the Sunset Club, "I'm not gonna die having lost my hair, having lost my strength- I don't want that," you know? So there is an element of, like, assisted- it's not assisted suicide. But it's assisted death here for him- but there's just a lot. There's a lot of pieces. But it is the first time that she has a direct hand in a human being dying, that is not just by her not saving them.
Jenny: Yeah and that raises some kind of morality question.
Kristin: Of course. I mean, gosh. If you want to talk about morality debates, there's a huge morality debate around assisted suicide and people being able to or not being able to have the ownership of their own person to say "I would like to die now," when they're super ill or suffering or what have you. So, you know, not to put too, too much on this. But this is a big moment and it's given that space in the episode. There's a lot of weight on the moment when Buffy says, "we have to come back" and they all say "why?" And she says "For the body." Or does she say "for the body"?
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Yeah. With that little scratch on her head. It's real stuff. This episode ends with- you know, the episode ends with a scene that describes everything we've been seeing in the entire episode-
Jenny: Right.
Kristin: And in the entire series. It's a really pivotal moment when Ford- unbeknownst to us as to why he is being buried in the Sunnydale cemetery but-
Jenny: I wonder if Buffy went back for the body, buried him in the cemetery because in order for a vampire to change-
Kristin: Ohhh…
Jenny: They have to be buried in consecrated dirt? I have no idea. And then waited so that he wouldn't be shipped home to his parents and become a vampire living in L.A.? I wonder?
Kristin: Right, that makes sense. But now he's dust so how are they going to explain that? Whatever.
Jenny: Difficult to say.
Kristin: One day they'll make the series "Behind the Scenes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer." [Jenny laughs] But this exchange between Giles and Buffy- it has to be one of the more meaningful exchanges in the series, right? It underlines everything that is to come and that has even gone past in the series, that things are hard, that high school is fucking hard, this time in your life when you're learning that it's not just good or bad, it's not just A or B, that things are really complicated. And Buffy is saying these words, you know? I can't tell anymore, I can't tell what's good and what's bad anymore, things are getting more confusing. And she asks Giles, "Does it ever get easy?" Right? And then Giles is like, "What do you want me to say to that?" And she says, "Lie to me." And he says, "It's very simple. Yes." [Jenny laughs] The villains are always wearing capes and you know? He doesn't say that, but he-
Jenny: Uh, how dare you? How dare you cast-
Kristin: Oh, capes? [laughing]
Jenny: Yes, in such a unflattering light?
Kristin: [laughing] Sorry, Jenny. But you know, this is beautiful. It's really beautiful and we're going to see so much of this as the series continues of how do you tell what's good and how do you tell what's not good? And this is what we live in our day-to-day lives.
Jenny: Mmhmm. It's just really beautiful. We're seeing all of these relationships that we've seen built and developed, this network has expanded, and the ropes that bind individuals to one another have thickened. And now that that foundation is established… we begin to have reasons to call into question, what is this relationship and what does that relationship mean and what does it mean when this person lies to that person?
Kristin: Yeah, it's no longer, there's a slayer and there's a vampire and it's very clear what needs to happen.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: That has been tossed to the side and now we are in relationships where we don't know. We don't know what we want even, right? 'Cause the big bad right now is Spike and Drusilla, and I don't know how you all are feeling, but I surely do not want them to go away.
Jenny: No, I want them to stay forever.
Kristin: I want them to stay forever too and that's hard. We've saying- we love Spike and Drusilla's love, but their love is rooted in killing people.
Jenny: Yes, yes. It's complicated.
Kristin: It's hard, it's very hard.
Jenny: Does it ever get easier, Kristin?
Kristin: What do you want me to say to you, Jenny?
Jenny: [singing] Lie to me. [normal speech] Lie, lie to me.
Kristin: Yes, Jenny, it gets easier. Decisions become clear-
Jenny: Oh.
Kristin: You can tell who's good and who's bad.
Jenny: Thank you.
Kristin: And you'll be okay.
Jenny: [gasps] Hooray!
Kristin: The sky is clear.
