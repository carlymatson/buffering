Buffering the Vampire Slayer
Episode 0.41: Celebrating 25 Years of Buffy from Sunnydale High
[CHIME]
Kristin: Hello. What the heck am I doing here? It’s a Friday. I know. Probably I
should have been here on Wednesday, but I think some of us who attended prom
needed a couple of extra days [laughing] of rest. I’m here to give you just a tiny
little intro, just a smidge of an intro into the very, very special night that we spent,
last Friday, March 11th, 2022, at Torrance High School in Torrance, California, AKA
Sunnydale High School. We gathered together, hundreds of us, to celebrate the
25th anniversary of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. You’re gonna hear from us, you’re
gonna hear from Morgan and LaToya from Angel On Top. You’re gonna hear from
Evan Ross Katz, you’re gonna hear from Joanna Robinson. It’s a really, really, really
beautiful time that we spent.
And today is actually the last day that you can watch this show. It was on video on
demand for seven days, and today, it will expire. So if listening is not enough for
you, and you wanna see the PowerPoint presentation we do at the end, or if you’d
like to hear the live music that Jenny played, that’s only available on the Moment
House site. So to find that, you just go to
momenthouse.com/bufferingthevampireslayer. Again, it expires at 8 PM Eastern
time tonight, Friday night, March 18th.
Over there, you can see us. You can see us on stage, you can see our faces. You
can hear the six amazing songs that Jenny sang. You can also see that PowerPoint
presentation. But don’t worry, when we get to the PowerPoint, I’ve also linked a
copy of that PowerPoint presentation in today’s show notes. And you’ll hear me pop
in as a little voice of…god? That’s dramatic. But you know what I mean. [laughs]
When we get to that point in the taping.
Two other things to tell you before we roll on into this very special show. You’ll hear
us speak with the wonderful Evan Ross Katz, whose book, Into Every Generation a
Slayer is Born: How Buffy Staked Our Hearts, just came out this week. We are also
going to be talking to Evan at length about the book. So please stay tuned, because
in early April, you’ll get a longer conversation with Evan. And again, the title of that
book is Into Every Generation a Slayer is Born: How Buffy Staked Our Hearts. Evan
Ross Katz, you should grab yourself a copy.
The second is that today is also the last day to snag yourself exclusive prom
merchandise. It is available only if you had a ticket to the event itself, or if you have
a ticket to the Moment House show. If you’re a ticket holder, you know that secret


link to that store. Go on over there, ‘cause it’s gonna be gone tomorrow and if you
want to get that merch and you haven’t yet, you can go on over to
momenthouse.com/bufferingthevampireslayer. We’ve got t-shirts and crop tops and
hoodies and pins and they’re all very special. And after tomorrow, they will no
longer be available.
We had the most wonderful time. We will thank everyone in-episode, but my
goodness, thank you all for joining with us, virtually and in person. And I’m gonna
be quiet now and let you listen to the show.
[Buffering theme plays]
[cheering and applause]
Kristin: Alright, hold on, hold on. Jenny—Jenny, do you wanna do the thing you
wanted to do? [crowd laughs] Jenny—okay, so hi! [cheering and applause] So.
Jenny really wanted to have us run down the aisle and up the ramp. [crowd laughs]
But I—actually, let me show ya. I’m wearing JNCOs? [cheering and applause] So I
said no. [crowd laughs] However, without further ado, Jenny Owen Youngs!
[cheering and applause]
Jenny: Hello! [crowd cheers]
Kristin: Wow. Have you ever, like, had that feeling that you’re sitting inside of
Sunnydale fucking High School? [cheering and applause]
Jenny: I’m having that feeling right now. Actually. I’m also having the feeling that I
just…ran—
Kristin: Yeah, you see? [crowd laughs] That’s exactly what I was talking about. So,
this was the first look—was the jackets. But the real look—and you saw my JNCOs.
But do you wanna show the people what you’re wearing for your 90s look? Jenny
Owen Youngs, modeling carpenter jeans. [crowd cheers] A flannel. And a Nirvana
Sliver T-shirt. [cheering and applause]
Jenny: I had this shirt in high school. For real. [crowd laughs] And I was like,
maybe I could get—maybe I could source one, but now they are $900. [crowd
laughs]


Kristin: And I did not approve that on the budget item. As a budget item. I also
would like to confess that I never actually wore a chain wallet. [crowd makes
disappointed sound] I know! I did a lot of other things. [crowd laughs]
Jenny: A lot!
Kristin: I smoked clove cigarettes, you know? I wrote on my shell tops. But I
didn’t—but I put this outfit on and I was like, there’s no way that this outfit can be
complete without a chain. It’s just not… [crowd laughs]
Jenny: It looks very natural. On you. It looks like you were born—you came out of
the womb—
Kristin: Yeah, well—
Jenny: With a little chain—attached to what? Nobody knows. [crowd laughs]
Kristin: We were…[laughs]
Jenny: That’s what gets you? [crowd laughs] You never know.
Kristin: You never know, with me. We were talking to one of our friends backstage.
And she was like, “Every time your chain hits the plastic school chair, I am
transported back.” [everyone laughs] So. We’re doing something very special
tonight. And we’re—I’m nervous. Are you nervous?
Jenny: I am. Uncharacteristically…nervous.
Kristin: Well, I was talking—we were talking about this backstage. I’m like, I don’t
know why I’m so nervous. And then I realized it’s because we’re at a high school
and I had no whiskey, at all. [crowd laughs] None! Whew. So I can really feel
everything happening inside of my body. [Jenny laughs] We have some special
guests. I know you cheered for them already, but how excited are we to hear from
our nemesis-es, first of all. [cheering and applause]
Jenny: Yes. Not my nemesis-es.
Kristin: I think you are their nemesis-es if they say you are. Like, I think just you—
Jenny: I did not consent! [crowd laughs] To this feud!


Kristin: We’ll discuss this when they come up to stage. I have a favor to ask of
you, as well, while it’s on my mind. Actually, you wanted to say.
Jenny: Yeah, I wanted to take control here, because this is a technological issue
and pod dad rules supreme over all tech. As you know. Please take your phones off
the wifi, if they’re on the wifi. We are broadcasting—
Kristin: Hopefully.
Jenny: [laughs] Hopefully. [everyone laughs] To a whole bunch of people who
weren’t able to be here in person. And we wanna make sure that their feed is as
crisp and clean as possible.
Kristin: Hi, Mom. [crowd laughs]
Jenny: Oh yeah, also, hi, Mom.
Kristin: And Dad. Okay. [laughs] Yeah, so Morgan and LaToya are gonna come up
here. We have Evan Ross Katz here with us. [cheering and applause]
Jenny: Very exciting.
Kristin: It’s not a big deal. He just wrote a fucking book. About Buffy. Also, for
those of you who ordered it and got it signed, these were, like, the first copies that
Evan signed. And they—and he signed them in Sunnydale High School, which is so
fucking cool!
Jenny: You’re welcome!
Kristin: And we also have Joanna Robinson, I don’t know if you’ve…[cheering and
applause] [Jenny and Kristin laugh] Heard of her.
Jenny: She’s cool!
Kristin: She’s pretty cool. And we are taking you through—and this is the other
reason I think we’re both a little more nervous than usual, is—normally we have,
you know. Four acts of a television show, characters we know, to move through.
But tonight, we are doing our favorite moments from inside of Sunnydale High
School. So—[crowd cheers] yeah. So we had all of our guests pick their moment.
We’re gonna show you the clips that they picked, and then we’re gonna talk—fun,
right? Yeah. The, like, eight of you who just need to “woo” after everything, you
keep—you do! You keep me alive. You do. [cheering] [Jenny laughs] I’m like, there


are at least eight people who are still into me talking. [crowd laughs] Yeah. So
that’s the plan for the evening. And I’m going to say—and see, now you can’t even
do your “mom is drunk” chant, because…Mom is—I know! [crowd laughs] I fucking
know. But I’m just gonna say thank you for being here. And this is definitely the
most overwhelming experience we have ever had? Ever? It is—I don’t know. Maybe
some of you had tickets to go to the prom, April 2020. Anybody? [cheering] Yeah.
Jenny: RIP.
Kristin: Alba, did you just raise your hand?
Jenny: Alba!
Kristin: Alba and Mack are here! [cheering and applause] Hey! Wow, we could
have met you at prom. The prom that never was. But it’s been a couple years, in a
lot of ways, and it is—
Jenny: It’s been a couple years in a lot of ways. Mostly just the one. [crowd
laughs] But also, maybe some others that we haven’t yet explored. But perhaps we
will this very eve. Kristin. Can I ask you a question?
Kristin: Please, Jenny.
Jenny: I’ve been really wanting to know. We both have these letterman jackets,
which may or may not be enchanted. [crowd laughs] TBD.
Kristin: I took mine off immediately. [crowd laughs]
Jenny: I did not. [Kristin laughs] I wanted to ask, what did you letter in, at
Sunnydale High?
Kristin: What do you mean?
Jenny: Why do you have a varsity jacket? What are you participating in at the
varsity level?
Kristin: Do you have a guess? ‘Cause I have an answer.
Jenny: Are there varsity jackets for theater? [cheering]
Kristin: Um, first of all, why don’t you rewind the fucking tape and say that again—


Jenny: [laughing] Sorry.
Kristin: And be nice to us theater kids?
Jenny: Ooh! [cheering and applause] Okay.
Kristin: You didn’t say it again! [crowd laughs]
Jenny: [with forced enthusiasm] Wow, I bet there’s varsity jackets for theater!
[cheering and applause] Ohh, and then would you have the little masks on the
jacket? ‘Cause you have the icon for—
Kristin: Yeah, I mean, that wasn’t—that is what I would literally have my letter for.
But I had an answer for the sport I am most talented at.
Jenny: Is it hacky sack? [crowd laughs] The year is 1999.
Kristin: Yeah, no. It’s devil sticks. [Jenny laughs] You remember?
Jenny: Yeah. [cheering]
Kristin: No, it was hula-hooping!
Jenny: Oh yeah!
Kristin: I don’t know if anybody brought a hula hoop, but I can prove this. [crowd
laughs]
Jenny: You should have brought a hula hoop.
Kristin: I know. I have—
Jenny: [sim] You have a hula hoop that comes apart for travel! [everyone laughs]
Kristin: Listen, I’ve lived a long life, okay? [laughs] My career has taken me many,
many bizarre places. [laughs]
Jenny: Mmm.
Kristin: Jenny, what would your letter be for?
[long pause]


Jenny: Well…[crowd laughs] yeah. Just like, reading comic books. [crowd laughs]
Marching band.
Kristin: [sim] I can picture you—[cheers] there you go. Marching—were you in
marching band in high school?
Jenny: For, um, one game. But. [crowd laughs]
Kristin: What happened?!
Jenny: The sousaphone was very heavy. [crowd laughs] And it was too painful to
play, so I retired.
Kristin: So you—
Jenny: I had an injury. [crowd laughs]
Kristin: Wait, but you learned to play the sousaphone—
Jenny: Well, I already played the tuba in band. I’m actually very cool. [everyone
laughs] Unlike some theater nerds I know. [crowd laughs] So the sousaphone is the
same thing, it just wraps around you like a boa constrictor and drags you down to
earth. [crowd laughs] While you try to force incredible amounts of air through it.
Kristin: And then you did actually get injured, or you were like, fuck this?
Jenny: I was like, ow! [everyone laughs] My neck hurts.
Kristin: There’s something about these two pieces of hair that, like, just makes me
feel like I’m in the bathroom at high school and I’m about to be like, “you wanna
sneak out for a cigarette?” You know? [crowd laughs] Please. Anybody? I know—is
Stacy here? Stacy—there’s probably 50 Stacys here. [crowd laughs] Stacy with the
D.A.R.E fanny pack with the cigarettes? [someone cheers] Yeah. We talked. We had
a whole thing. I know where to find my cigarettes later, okay! So we’re here to talk
about Buffy the Vampire Slayer. [cheering and applause] I realized something—for
those of you who are having so much fun already that you wanna come
immediately back the next time we do something here. Which is that, in two years,
we could have the 25th high school reunion…[crowd reacts] for Buffy the Vampire
Slayer. ‘Cause they all grad—I don’t know, that was a mixed—it was really mixed
out there. [cheering]


Jenny: Perhaps the crushing weight of mortality…[crowd laughs]
Kristin: Wait, wait, maybe it was because everybody was doing…
[HELLMATH jingle plays]
Hellmath!
Jenny: Ohh, yeah! [applause] Maybe they were doing hell-math.
Kristin: I’m getting better at these fucking jingles. [crowd laughs] Alright! Um.
Jenny: [laughs] Six years later. [everyone laughs]
Kristin: It’s hard!
Jenny: Really starting to get a hang of this shit!
Kristin: I’m on the videos, the music.
Jenny: I know.
Kristin: I got your jacket made for you, you know what I mean?!
Jenny: I appreciate that.
Kristin: So, Jenny, is there anything else that—’cause we are—we’re saving our
pick for last. Yeah, it—’cause it requires—there’s a lot of, like, science involved. We
have, like—
Jenny: Quadratic equations…
Kristin: Yeah. Jenny has a—I don’t—should I not tell them what you have? Oh, you
have it right there. Do you wanna show them what you’re gonna use later?
Jenny: I’ll show them one of my—
Kristin: Okay.
Jenny: Scientific props. It’s a clipboard. [cheering] I borrowed it from Angie,
thanks, Angie. [Kristin and Jenny laugh] For the use of your clipboard.


Kristin: Hey, actually, you make a really good point. How about up at the top here
we thank—first of all. We have a team here at Torrance: Alyssa, Chris, Larry, and
Larry. Who—[cheering and applause]
Kristin and Jenny: Two Larrys!
Jenny: No waiting!
Kristin: Two. Larrys. [applause dies down] Chris—and I might repeat myself
tomorrow for those of you who will be joining us, but Chris was the person planning
events here when Buffy the Vampire Slayer was being filmed. [cheering] So—
Jenny: [laughs] They’re destroyed.
Kristin: He’s got stories, I’m just saying. Find him tomorrow night, he’s got stories.
And also, Angie—who’s over there, I see you, Angie.
Jenny: Angie! [cheering and applause]
Kristin: Angie and the whole team that Angie has brought in, everyone here has
been so incredible. So thank you. [applause] And then, we are streaming to about
600 other people right now, because of Kristen on the—great name, Kristen—on the
camera! [cheering] John Mark and Morgan in the back here. So it’s just—a lot of
humans, putting a lot of love into this space, so thank you, everyone. And, um,
Jenny, I don’t know. Do you have any other things you wanna say before we try to
settle this fucking feud once and for all? [cheers]
Jenny: Only that I never entered a feud, to my knowledge, and I can’t wait to
greet my very best…pod-friends when they ascend to the stage.
Kristin: Morgan? LaToya? Are you here? Are you here with us? Can you please…
Jenny: If you dare! [cheering and applause]
Kristin: Come on—come on up here! [cheering and applause continues]
Jenny: Get a look at these friggin’ outfits!
Kristin: Look at them! Look at them! Wow. Do you know that this is the first
fucking time that the four of us have ever been in a physical space together?
Like—I had never—[cheers] I know. I know, it’s wild. So hi!


Morgan: Oh my god, hi!
LaToya: Hello.
Kristin: [sim] Oh my god, my chain wallet is caught on something. [everyone
laughs]
LaToya: Hello, little Jenny. Hello, Justine Junior.
Jenny: Little! [crowd reacts]
Kristin: [laughs] I’m sorry.
LaToya: Right on that wallet chain! [laughs]
Morgan: I’m very worried—
Kristin: [sim] You just referred to me as—the first words out of your mouth…were
referring to me as Justine Junior.
Jenny: Incredible.
LaToya: Well, this is a feud.
Many: [chanting] Feud! Feud! Feud! Feud! Feud! Feud!
Morgan: Yes.
Jenny: Sounds like the feud is with Kristin, to me. [everyone laughs]
Morgan: You watch your step, yes.
Kristin: Also, I’m just gonna go out and say that, like, some people were very
afraid to chant “feud.” I was like—however!
LaToya: It’s safe, don’t worry.
Kristin: [sim] Alba was chanting so loud, in the—[laughter]
Morgan: Thank you, Alba.
Kristin: I was like, feud yeah! Well, welcome.


Morgan: Oh my gosh, thank you for having us.
Kristin: How are you feeling?
Morgan: Oh, you know, not at all terrified. [laughter] Super normal.
Kristin: So—
LaToya: Thank you for inviting us into your jar.
Morgan: Yeah.
Kristin: Ohh, yeah.
Morgan: And your corner.
Jenny: Thank you for entering my jar. [laughter]
Morgan: Pretty crowded in here with these two cents, skittering around. [laughter]
LaToya: “Skittering!” Wow.
Kristin: You all picked a clip—
LaToya: [inaudible] Harriet the Spy.
Kristin: [sim] I’ve set everybody up, they know what to expect. Your clip is—it’s a
short clip, and it is a very specific pick. So. I don’t know if you wanna say anything
about it before or if you prefer I just play it.
LaToya: If you don’t mind, Morgan, I just wanna say—
Morgan: Oh, please.
LaToya: You know. Over on Angel On Top, we really care about the classics, you
know?
Morgan: Mmhmm.
LaToya: Sophocles. [crowd laughs]


Morgan: Absolutely.
LaToya: The immortal bard, William Shakespeare.
Morgan: Mmhmm.
LaToya: Sir Kenneth Branagh.
Morgan: Uh-huh. [crowd laughs]
Kristin: I like how we kept them far apart from each other to, like, dilute their
power. [laughter]
Morgan: Yeah, if we can feed off each other, it’s way too dangerous. [laughter] And
if I may preface this clip, I just would like to say that you asked us this and this was
our immediate response.
Kristin: Wow!
Morgan: Like, it was so fast, the speed with which we got back to you with this
option. [Kristin laughs] It was…unreal, really. So.
Kristin: Okay, well, let’s—
Morgan: Let’s hit it, bitch. [laughs]
LaToya: [sim] Because we share one brain cell.
Kristin: Let’s hit it, bitch!
Morgan: Hit it, bitch! [crowd laughs]
[cheering and applause]
[Clip from “Puppet Show” plays to periodic laughter from hosts and crowd]
Willow: [flatly] O ruler of my country, Oedipus, you see our company around
the altar, and I, the priest of Zeus!
Xander: [nervous] Ha, ha! They prophesize that I should kill my father. But
he is dead, and hidden deep in the soil. But surely I must fear my mother's
bed.


Buffy: [bored and rushed] Oh, Oedipus, Oedipus, unhappy Oedipus, that is
all I can call you and all that I ever shall call you.
Xander: Darkness! And horror of darkness. Unfolding, restless, visitant, sped
by an ill wind in haste. Madness, and…madness a-and stabbing pain, and,
a-and, uh… oh… oh… memory of, uh, i-ill deeds I have done.
[pause as audience laughs]
[sound of Willow’s footsteps running away]
[cheering and applause]
[Kristin laughs]
Morgan: So do you need us to say anything in addition to that? I feel like it speaks
for itself.
Jenny: I have some questions.
Morgan: Alright.
Jenny: Individually, what are your…experiences, personally, with high school
theater? Did you do it? [crowd laughs]
Kristin: Remember, she’s very judgey. [crowd laughs]
Jenny: I’m just cur—I’m very curious.
Morgan: [affronted] Did I do it? [laughter] I was president of drama club!
[cheering and applause] Thank you.
Kristin: Okay.
Morgan: And my administration was a kind one and a thoughtful one, and we got
shit done. [laughter]
Jenny: Were there any feuds during your reign?


Morgan: Ehh, none that I can disclose. I mean, none that I can talk about with you
guys right now. [laughter] But yeah, I mean, it got contentious sometimes,
absolutely. It wouldn’t be high school theater if it didn’t.
Kristin: What was your favorite show in high school that you did?
Morgan: Um, I really liked when we did Into the Woods. I was one of the
stepsisters. [laughs] [crowd cheers] I was Florinda, she’s the one who loses the toe,
gang. [laughter]
Kristin: LaToya.
LaToya: I don’t know if you’ve noticed, I don’t have theater kid energy. [everyone
laughs] I did take a drama class in high school, as well as a couple of drama classes
in college. You know, Shakespeare, Stafford, maybe you’ve heard of them?
Kristin: Oh. [laughter] Not me. I’m just lowly Justine Junior. [everyone laughs]
Jenny: Okay, second question for each of you. Have either of you ever—yourselves,
or have you ever known anyone who accidentally—like, because of a prophecy—
accidentally and unknowingly had intimate relations with their mother? [everyone
laughs]
LaToya: Well, over on Angel On Top, Season 4. [crowd laughs and applauds]
Morgan: We’re experiencing something. [laughter]
Kristin: I just—
Morgan: Rather difficult. [laughter]
Kristin: I was like, do I have a jingle for this? I don’t think I even do.
Jenny: Nobody should have a jingle for this!
Morgan: [sim] You have a “fucking your mom” jingle? [laughter]
LaToya: [singing] “You didn’t ask for this!”
Morgan: [singing] “Nobody ever does!”
[someone cheers loudly]


LaToya: [laughing] Jill.
Kristin: Jill!
Morgan: There we go, thank you, Jill. [laughter]
Kristin: Jenny actually has a theory from the Angelverse for you that can connect
this. Even—in a way that doesn’t make us all wanna just vomit at the table.
Morgan: Yeah, I don’t wanna gag in front of these nice people.
Kristin: I don’t think, anyway. I don’t know, Jenny, do you wanna say your theory?
Or your whatever?
Jenny: Um, yes, but could you remind me very quietly what it is? [everyone
laughs]
Morgan: Please hold.
LaToya: It wouldn’t have happened on the Angel On Top liveshow! [laughs]
Jenny: [sim] Ohh, yeah! [cheering] Okay. Point. [crowd laughs]
Morgan: I can’t wait for this one.
Jenny: Point. Angel…
LaToya: Yeah?
Jenny: Was sired, or some might say, created—
LaToya and Morgan: Mmhmm?
Jenny: By Darla.
LaToya and Morgan: Okay.
Jenny: Who then…he most certainly…[crowd reacts] engaged—
Morgan: Well, Cordy’s always saying, Connor’s just like his dad. [everyone laughs]
She’s told us so many times.


Kristin: I thought it was gonna—
Jenny: [sim] I thought it’d be revelatory.
Kristin: Yeah. [Morgan laughs] No, this is the response I got when I compared
Gwendolyn Post to Hermione, so. [everyone laughs]
Jenny: [laughing] Oh, yeah!
Kristin: Now you know what it fucking feels like! [laughter]
Jenny: Doesn’t feel good! It’s hard being right all the time. [laughter]
Kristin: I understand, like, we all watch the scene and it’s phenomenal. But I do
wanna hear just, like, a tiny bit about why you think that it was the first thing to
come to both of you, out of three—I mean, there’s three seasons of moments in the
high school.
LaToya: Because we knew this was how it would feel.
Morgan: Yeah, we—[laughs] we planned in advance, you know, with our release
schedule. But I also think, like, it’s just…despite everything that has happened to
these teens, they are still teens. And that is, to me, the most important part of
Buffy, is the idea that, like, even though they’re fighting demons and they’re, like,
keeping the world from ending, they still have to do this dumb fucking play. [crowd
laughs] ‘Cause the principal said. And like, that Buffy—you can just see that she’s,
like, seething over the indignity. [laughter] She’s like, are you fucking kidding me?
Like, I save all of your asses all the time and you don’t even know about it and I
have to read this stupid—fine. [flatly] “Oedipus, Oedipus, that’s all you ever—”
like—[laughter] like, go off, queen, give us nothing. [laughter]
LaToya: And Morgan and I will be performing that tomorrow.
Morgan: Yeah, we will be doing it tomorrow for all of you. [cheering and applause]
Kristin: Is Jill gonna be the Willow? [laughter]
Morgan: If we can wrangle her, yeah.
Kristin: I will hold you to that. You have a lot of people that just witnessed that
promise.


Morgan: [laughing] Oh no.
Jenny: Binding contract.
Kristin: Yeah. It’s been wild because, like, you know, we haven’t been back in
seasons 1, 2 or 3 in quite some time. And we did a journey through some of these
episodes. And it is a totally different thing.
Morgan: Yeah.
Kristin: It is a totally different thing. And even the way, like, Giles is responding to
them in the audience. It’s like, that Giles is no more, you know? Everyone is tired
now. [laughter]
Jenny: So tired.
Kristin: Everyone is really tired. They would not have fucking done Oedipus if it
was Season 7.
Morgan: No!
LaToya: Maybe they should have.
Kristin: They would have been like, yeah, there’s a fucking dead monster on the
stage. So, I don’t know, it’s Sunnydale. We need a beer. You know? [laughs]
Morgan: What I can’t fathom is why they let Xander have so many lines. Like.
[laughter] He was never gonna remember the—like, when he’s pulling for that line,
I’m like, how did we not all see this coming? [laughter] Like, he should have had
them written on his hand.
Kristin: But when you think about the fact that Willow has massive stage fright and
Buffy is like, I’m literally supposed to be saving the fucking world. Like, Xander
might be your pick.
Morgan: He’s the only option, yeah.
Kristin: He’s the only one, yeah.
LaToya: That was the hardest he ever tried in high school. [laughter]


Morgan: You can really see the effort, which is something that goes away after a
while. [laughter]
Kristin: Oh my goodness.
Jenny: He also put a lot of effort into swimming.
Morgan: Yes! [a few cheers] He tried really hard at swimming.
LaToya: [sim] What a good effort he put in. A very good effort. [laughter]
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Are we all—all four of us—straight women at this—
Morgan: Oh yes, heterosexual.
Jenny: [sim] Yes! Four completely straight women.
LaToya: Four straight women.
Kristin: Are we all into Xander in a speedo? Is everybody into it? [lukewarm
cheers]
Morgan: I mean, like, I was positive—
Kristin: [sim] [to the audience] I didn’t ask you all!
Morgan: [sim] Yeah, I’ll say it, I’m not a coward. He looked really good.
Kristin: Yeah. LaToya?
LaToya: He wasn’t speaking, it’s okay.
Morgan: Yeah! [laughter]
Kristin: Four out of four straight women agree. [crowd laughs]
Jenny: It cannot be denied.
Morgan: Mmhmm! [laughs]


Kristin: Now, go ahead. How do you all feel about Xander in a speedo? [cheers]
Morgan: Thank you.
LaToya: Straight women, every one.
Kristin: [sim] Okay, I was like, I heard more boos. You all got shamed out of
booing. [laughter]
Morgan: Too scared.
Kristin: We’re not yucking your…yuck. [crowd laughs]
Morgan: Yeah. I’m yumming your yuck, I love it.
Kristin: Love to yum a yuck. [laughter]
LaToya: I quit the podcast. [laughter]
Morgan: You can’t—that’s my line. [laughter]
Kristin: So—okay, so is there—I think my last question, and maybe you have
another question—no? You’re good? Okay. Is there anything that either of us could
do to mend—to sort of, like, bridge—to get to—to seal the—
LaToya: Well. You guys don’t know. These two already put a hit out on me at the
beginning of the night.
Morgan: Yeah. The second LaToya gets here, there was a trap. I’m very afraid
about what’s gonna befall me.
LaToya: [sim] Kristin just walked out of the room conveniently, and then I just
crashed and burned.
Kristin: [laughing] It’s true. The floor’s really slippery in the green room, but we
didn’t know until LaToya fell. [crowd laughs] They’re not lying. Except for the part
that I did, I did not do it. I didn’t do it, but like, the power that I would harness if I
could actually do that from outside of the room, is kind of hot.
Morgan: Impressive, yeah.
Kristin: You know? [laughter] [crowd agrees] Thank you.


Morgan: I mean, evil people are hot, so. [laughter]
Jenny: Oh, yeah.
Kristin: Lilah Morgan, stand up.
Jenny: Yeah. [crowd laughs]
Morgan: Please.
Kristin: So is that a no, there’s nothing we can do?
Morgan: I mean…
LaToya: I don’t know, got money?
Morgan: Yeah, you got money? [laughter] How much money do you have?
Kristin: We have some cash, actually.
Morgan: Oooh, okay.
Jenny: [sim] Yeah, we can grease these wheels.
Kristin: Yeah, we can take care of this. I’ll just get my duct tape wallet out of my
pocket.
Morgan: Yeah, would you mind? [laughter] Look, the feud must always continue.
It’s really, like, the fire that allows me to…do my job.
Kristin: What if, like, Jenny plays you beautiful music? Will that help? [cheering
and applause]
Jenny: No. That’s not gonna…hard no.
Morgan: I can’t imagine it hurting?
Kristin: Morgan is wavering! [laughter] What if I play glockenspiel with Jenny—?
Morgan: Yes, yes, yes, yes! [cheering and applause]


Jenny: Oh!
Kristin: Did it! We’re only missing LaToya.
LaToya: I did not agree to this, Morgan, goddamnit!
Morgan: Oh no, never mind! The feud rages on forever!
Kristin: You now see the power of keeping them far apart. [laughter] Alright, well.
Do you have anything else you’d like to say to these beautiful people, before Jenny
plays you a song to woo you into being not in a feud with us anymore?
Morgan: Thanks for coming. [laughs]
LaToya: Yeah. Thanks for not booing us out of the building. [laughter]
Kristin: Morgan and fucking LaToya, everyone! [cheers and applause] Well, here
we are again. Back at our desk. I always feel like—especially with these mics, I feel
like I’m like, and, uh, breaking news. [crowd laughs]
Jenny: Yeah!
Kristin: Um. Alright, Jenny, well. We should probably call somebody very important
up here with us.
Jenny: We should.
Kristin: It just so happens that the human that, like, wrote this book is gonna
come up here next. Evan, how do you feel about it? Do you feel good about it? Do
you wanna come and join us? Are you feeling in the mood? [cheers and applause]
Jenny: [yells] Evan Ross Katz! [at a distance] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Kristin: Welcome!
Evan: Thank you, thank you.
Kristin: Look at your sweater. Just look at it. [cheering]
Jenny: It’s very beautiful.
Evan: I just wanted to fit in, you know, and just not stand out at all.


Kristin: Yeah, yeah. [crowd laughs] No, it blends, yeah.
Jenny: Just blend, yeah.
Evan: Thank you, thank you. Yeah.
Kristin: Definitely.
Evan: Lowkey.
Kristin: Um, Evan. Congratulations on your book.
Evan: Thanks! Thank you. [cheering and applause]
Kristin: I know this isn’t really the point, but I started reading this book and it
opens and Evan is talk—is talking about the musical Rent. Heard of it? [cheers] And
then—and I don’t know, maybe this is a deep cut. But then you bring in Sarah
Schulman, who wrote People in Trouble, which was sort of what Rent was kinda
scooped from. If you don’t know about it, whatever. And that was when I fell in love
with you, Evan. [laughter]
Jenny: This is all moving so fast! Should I go? [laughter]
Evan: No, we need you. [laughs]
Kristin: Anyway, I just—like, it’s just—it’s lovely to have you here. And you are not
only very, very well-versed in Buffy, but I believe you are, like, a Sarah Michelle
Gellar…scholar? Is that the term?
Evan: I use the term historian, but I think scholar—
Kristin: Historian.
Evan: No, scholar certainly works.
Kristin: Okay.
Evan: I mean, it’s of the same ilk.
Jenny: Do you have a lot of scrolls?


Evan: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think a lot of the text is kept on scrolls just to preserve
it, you know? [crowd laughs] I think it’s all about preserving her memory. And I
mean, obviously begins with Buffy, but you know, you have All My Children, Scooby
Doo, Cruel Intentions. There’s a lot on those scrolls. [cheering]
Kristin: In case you doubted the historian-scholar level.
Evan: And we can go deep-cuts, like Simply Irresistible. [Kristin laughs] You know,
Harvard Man. [cheering and applause] Yeah.
Someone in crowd: [inaudible; possibly: “False prophet!”]
[laughter]
Evan: Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
Kristin: Evan, have you been here before? Have you been to Torrance?
Evan: I have not, and it was so surreal pulling up, for all the obvious reasons. But
no, never. But wow. Yeah. Yeah.
Kristin: [sighs] Well, welcome.
Evan: Thank you, thank you.
Kristin: We have kind of a lot to cover here. Because we wanna talk about your
book, but we also wanna play a clip. And you and Joanna both picked some meaty
clips, okay?
Jenny: Juicy!
Kristin: So we’re gonna—yeah, we’re gonna get juicy. I hope everybody’s buckled
in. Are you ready to watch this clip with everybody?
Evan: Of course I am.
Kristin: Do you wanna set it up at all? Do you wanna tell them what they’re about
to see?
Evan: All I wanna say is that, you know, when choosing clips around the high
school, there was one character that came to mind that for me, sort of—you


know—is embedded in the high school. And that was Faith. I thought we needed
Faith.
[cheering and applause]
[Clip from “Choices” plays]
Mayor: You don’t like to think about the future, you don’t like to make plans.
Unless you want Faith to gut your friend like a sea bass, you’ll show a little
respect for your elders.
Angel: You're not my elder. I've got a lotta years on you.
Mayor: Yeah, and that's just one of the things you're going to have to deal
with. You're immortal, she's not. It's not easy. I married my Edna May in
aught-three and I was with her right until the end. Not a pretty picture.
Wrinkled and senile and cursing me for my youth. Wasn't our happiest time.
And let’s forget the fact that any moment of true happiness will turn you evil.
[scoffs] I mean, come on. What kind of a life can you offer her? I don't see a
lot of Sunday picnics in the offing. I see skulking in the shadows, hiding from
the sun. She's a blossoming young girl and you want to keep her from the
life she should have until it’s passed her by. And by god, I think that's a little
selfish. Is that what you came back from hell for? Is that your greater
purpose? [pause] Make the trade.
Snyder: Mr. Mayor, I had no idea you…I'm terribly sorry.
Mayor: No, it's I who should apologize. I mean, coming down here at night.
What must you be thinking? But you see, I just needed to…uh, no! Don't do
that!
[hissing and screaming]
[crowd laughs and applauds]
Evan: [laughing] The perfect cut. [laughter]
Jenny: I love that you think of Sunnydale High, and then you think, Faith. Because
she doesn’t even go here?! [cheers]
Evan: It’s true.


Jenny: But she’s so powerful!
Evan: It’s true, but she wills students out of class by merely showing up in
windows. You know?
Kristin: Oh! [cheering]
Evan: It’s a powerful thing.
Kristin: Je—Jen—Je—? [crowd laughs] She needs, like, a warning before recalling
that moment. You know?
Evan: Mmm.
Jenny: Yes. Such a scene cannot be just invoked willy-nilly. [crowd laughs]
Evan: Yes. Yes, yes.
Kristin: Ahh, this is a good scene that you picked.
Evan: You know, I picked it because I felt like there are very few scenes where you
get the full cast together—
Kristin: Yeah.
Evan: To begin with. And then on top of that, you add the mayor. And then you add
Principal Snyder. And I feel like you get this meeting of all of the great characters in
one room together, and just all of the different dynamics. Even watching Oz just
now, interact with the mayor. [Kristin gasps] Just strangeness and—yeah.
Kristin: Oh my god, and also, the scene—’cause, like, I rewatched the episode to
talk to you about it, you know. And the scene right before this is when Oz knocks
over the fucking urn! [cheering] ‘Cause he’s like, fuck you, we’re saving Willow!
Ugh. It’s so good.
Evan: Yeah.
Kristin: Um, okay, first of all, do I have your permission—since Faith is what
conjured this scene for you, do I have your permission to play Faith’s jingle? Is
that…[cheering]
Evan: Please.


Kristin: Okay.
[FAITH jingle plays]
She's from Boston, keeps it Spartan, doesn't need any frills
Seems like she's the only one who's taking care of herself
Don't call her loser, she's a bruiser with the power and skill
But the demons deep inside her are the hardest to kill
Faith!
[cheering and applause]
Jenny: Yay!
Kristin: Also, I know—okay! Okay, sorry—[laughter] Jenny, go ahead, go ahead.
Before you explode. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Jenny: No, go ahead.
Kristin: Oh, I—[laughs] I was just gonna say, do we all feel like Principal Snyder
wants to be eaten by the mayor, a little bit? [laughter] Right?
Evan: Yeah, yeah.
Kristin: Like, watching that scene, I was like, he’s kinda probably into it, in that
last—
Evan: Yeah.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Yeah. Okay, now Jenny, please. Go ahead, say a smart thing.
Jenny: A kink that can only exist on the Hellmouth. [crowd laughs]
Evan: Mmm.
Jenny: I really loved rewatching this episode and this scene, because man, it’s
so—like, thank you—so incredibly special to see the mayor, like, give his speech, all
these great reasons why, you know, Buffy and Angel have some thinking to do. And
then he’s so disgusted with them for not listening to reason—


Evan: Right.
Jenny: That he’s just like, [tsks] “Make the trade!” [crowd laughs]
Evan: Right.
Jenny: Bless. That’s all, I just love—I actually like this show a lot? So—[crowd
laughs] a lot of you don’t know that about me.
Evan: Yeah.
Jenny: But. Well chosen.
Evan: [sim] No, and two—yeah, thank you. And two, I feel like in that moment,
you can kind of watch Angel and David Boreanaz’s performance and realize that the
character is realizing that some of what the mayor is saying is starting to soak in.
And then that leads us to the prom, and—so I feel like a lot happens in this scene.
And then, also, just again, that dynamic between the mayor and Principal Snyder is
just…kind of—I don’t wanna say erotic? [crowd laughs] But there’s just some sort of
underlying tension.
Jenny: Yeah, it’s charged as hell!
Evan: Yeah, charged.
Kristin: If you were gonna say “erotic,” this would be the place.
Evan: Great, yeah, yeah.
Jenny: [laughs] Yeah.
Kristin: To say it. And also, I mean—and we all know this. We’re all here ‘cause we
know this. But it’s just like, the mayor is so—was so delicious, I think, even at the
top of the season. But like, now, when we’re in here, and he’s, like, really starting
to lose his shit. It’s so—Harry Groener is so fucking good!
Evan: So good, and then coming off of Spike and Drusilla in Season 2, you’re kind
of like, okay, well, can we get another great Big Bad coming off of that? And I feel
like they managed to.
Kristin: They did it.


Evan: Adam, then? [laughter] I don’t know if we kept the momentum, but like, we
had a thing going.
Kristin: You don’t think that a demon that takes a floppy drive in the upper left
quadrant of his chest—
[crowd laughs]
Evan: I don’t know about him.
Kristin: No? Didn’t work for you, Evan?
Evan: Sorry.
Kristin: Alright, fine. Adam. You know—all I hear when I hear “Adam” is: “Mommy.”
[laughter]
Evan: [laughing] Oh, yeah.
Kristin: We should—let’s talk about your book for a second.
Evan: Please.
Kristin: Should we do that? [cheering] Jenny has a particular segment that really
meant a lot to her, so I’m gonna—
Jenny: Youuu…talked to Marc Blucas. [crowd laughs]
Kristin: She was like, “Oh my god, I can get Riley into the high school-themed
conversation. [laughter] Let me at him!”
Jenny: I have a word highlighted—I hope you’re not—you don’t feel disrespected
that I highlighted in your book—
Evan: No! [Kristin laughs]
Jenny: But it felt very important.
Evan: No.
Jenny: The word that I highlighted, that you wrote in your amazing, beautiful
book, is: Briley. [laughter]


Kristin: I just wanna verify that it is the only word highlighted on either one of
those two pages—
Evan: It makes sense, it makes sense.
Kristin: Is one little…
Jenny: This is so good. It’s so much better than Ruffy? [crowd laughs]
It’s…so…weird and, like, tactile and kind of, like, abrasive.
Evan: Mmm.
Jenny: Which some would say feels appropriate for the pairing—
Evan: Yeah.
Jenny: Maybe not me, but like, some people.
Kristin: Well, can we get a—can we get, like, an opinion there? From you, Evan?
Where do you fall on the Buffy—Briley—where do you fall on the Briley, uh…you
know. Scale.
Evan: More favorable about the relationship early on, when his character was very
different and a little bit more happy-go-lucky. I think when we moved into the
Season 5 territory, it was a little bit like, what are you doing here? But I kind of felt
like, after Primeval, I thought that we were kind of done. And then when he showed
up in Buffy vs. Dracula, I was like, oh! [laughter] He’s still gonna be around. And
then…[laughter] Episode 9 and Episode 10, he’s still there. [laughter] But then that
helicopter came and I was just like, bye!
[cheering and applause]
Jenny: Did you feel any better about him when he came back with a big scar on his
face?
Evan: [sighs] No. No. [laughter] No! I recently rewatched that episode too, and I
was like—you know, ‘cause I missed him. And having spoken to the actor, I was
like, excited to see the character again. But, no. No, no, no. [crowd laughs]
Kristin: But what about his wife, Sam? You like her?


Evan: Ay-ay-ay! Ay-ay-ay! [laughter] Maybe just—if just Sam had existed, separate
from Riley, I think we could have a conversation.
Kristin: Okay.
Jenny: Mmm.
Kristin: Yeah, that’s fair.
Evan: Yeah.
Kristin: What if Sam and Buffy were to have gotten together?
Evan: Well, hello?
Kristin: Okay. [cheers] That’s what we’re talking about.
Evan: Sam comes in, she’s a customer at the Double Meat Palace, sees Buffy, tells
her, “You don’t need to be working here.” They run off, get married, happily ever
after, yeah, totally.
Kristin: Yes! [cheers and applause]
Jenny: A perfect story.
Evan: Yeah.
Someone in the crowd: Go away, Riley.
[crowd laughs]
Kristin: Yeah, I know. I was like, don’t we have—I think I put it in the lesser-used
jingles. I might be able to pull it up.
Jenny: Where it belongs!
Kristin: You wanna hear it? Is that what everybody wants? [cheering]
[GO AWAY RILEY jingle plays]
Riley, you are kind of like cardboard
Your mansplaining's best to be ignored
No one cares, you're our TA so please


Please go away
[applause]
Kristin: It’s the only jingle that I sing, because she would never. [laughter]
Evan: Fair.
Kristin: Jenny, did you have any more Briley—I have a question for you as well.
Because you talked to, like, a fuck-ton of people in this book. Like, listen. If you—
Jenny: I think—did you move in with Sarah Michelle Gellar? [crowd laughs] Are you
guys roommates now?
Evan: We have a condo and it’s kinda just like—you know, we both sort of meet up
there, yeah.
Jenny: Yes.
Evan: Kinda like a pied-à-terre for the two of us to share.
Jenny: Beautiful. [Kristin laughs] Congrats.
Evan: Thank you, thank you.
Kristin: Okay, nobody asked me to play a jingle for awhile, I lost the folder. Okay.
So you talked to a lot of people, but when we spoke, like, off-stage—you know, we
were talking about that there were a couple of people that didn’t talk to you. And
you thought maybe the audience would like to hear a little bit about that?
Evan: Yes. So I had—the only “no” from the outset was David Boreanaz. And David
Boreanaz’s people were like, “It is not happening.” Which I later learned, through
interviews in this book, that there is a little bit of a perhaps one-sided feud between
David Boreanaz and Nicholas Brendon.
Kristin: Oh my god, just like between LaToya and Jenny. [crowd laughs]
Evan: Exactly.
Jenny: What?! [laughter] Alright.
Kristin: It’s one-sided.


Jenny: Wow, which direction does it go? Are we not allowed to know?
Evan: It is Nicholas Brendon that has some very choice words for David Boreanaz.
Which you can read about in the book, amongst many choice words that Nicholas
Brendon has in general. [crowd laughs] He likes to talk. He really likes to talk. But
then Alyson and—[Kristin laughs] Alyson and Michelle were two other interviews
that I had confirmed for the book. I was obviously very excited to chat with Alyson,
because I don’t think she does a lot of talking about Buffy in the years since. And
she hasn’t done a lot of the public appearances with the rest of the cast. And then
when the allegations came out against Joss, I think at that point, Alyson’s team
intervened and said, we will not be talking. I went back to them, “Hey, can we have
the conversation with some parameters around what we talk about?” And the
answer was no. And so yeah, this book includes nine of the twelve original cast
members, as well as many other ancillary. But I fucking wanted Alyson.
Kristin: Yeah.
Evan: And knowing she was sort of in my grasp, it feels a little—it will always feel a
little incomplete. Just ‘cause there’s so many questions I think we all have for
Alyson Hannigan about this show, and just her time on it. But for now, she will
be—she’ll remain silent about her experience on the show.
Kristin: Yeah.
Evan: Which is her decision.
Kristin: It’s—you know, I mean, it’s almost like it’s kind of a complicated time to
be, you know, talking about Buffy the Vampire Slayer. [laughter]
Evan: Totally!
Kristin: In a podcast or in a book.
Evan: Yes.
Kristin: Yeah.
Evan: And it’s interesting, to that point. There were a lot of interviews that sort of
had a part two as a result. And it was interesting. There were several interviews
that, we conducted them, hunky-dory, everything was great. Allegations come out,
I get a phone call, “Can we chat again? I’m ready to actually talk.”


Kristin: Oh, wow!
Evan: Yes, and that happened quite a bit.
Kristin: Wow.
Evan: Danny Strong particularly [crowd reacts] had some stories that he was
finally ready to speak about. And so I think that in many senses, amongst much of
the good that came with this—’cause there is good in all of this—it has given people
some freedom to speak their truths.
Kristin: That’s fantastic, yes. [cheering and applause] I mean. Did you hear all of
those gasps and everything? [Evan laughs] I’ve never heard any of them respond to
anything like that. They’re in. You should—if you didn’t already get this book, get
this book. It’s—because it’s really—I mean, I think it’s, like, a love letter also to the
show, right? It’s not—’cause there are—there are a lot of things out there that are
about Buffy or that are interviews or what have you. But I think that, like, you are
so deeply enamored with the show, it’s such a part of your being. And so you are in
here, but then you also have them in there. And so it’s just a gorgeous thing, so
thank you for writing it.
Evan: Thank you! [applause] I felt like, with all the discussions that have happened
about Buffy through the years, I felt like, Sarah Michelle Gellar’s performance on
the show—and this is something that we all spoke about at length. Because both of
them are featured in this book. [cheers] And the lack of respect given—not by the
both of you. But by—and not by the fans! But just in general—
Kristin: Yeah.
Evan: To Sarah Michelle Gellar and this performance as Buffy?
Kristin: Yes! [applause]
Evan: And so I thought one of the great things that a book like this allows space for
is sort of the reframing to say, yes, this show was created by one man. But the
heartbeat of this show is vis-a-vis this woman and this performance. [cheers] And
so I thought it was just a time to sort of reframe the narrative and celebrate Sarah
Michelle Gellar. And so, it literally—a lot of the celebrities featured in the
book—unfortunately, some of them had not seen Buffy, but agreed to do interviews
just because they wanted to praise Sarah Michelle Gellar. [crowd reacts] And I think
that speaks to her and her character and her legacy.


Jenny: Wow.
Kristin: Hell yes. Hell. Yes. [applause] Evan.
Jenny: Um—
Kristin: Oh, yes.
Jenny: Wait. Sorry, just one—just one—
Kristin: [sim] Her whole head was just, like—eclipsed Evan’s head.
Jenny: Speaking of women and their legacies, I just wanna thank you so much for
making the decision to, uhh, quote me in your wonderful book, [crowd laughs]
saying the phrase, “a spicy meatball.”
Evan: Yes! [crowd laughs]
Jenny: Thank you. What. An honor. Two legacies are celebrated in this book, at
least! [laughter]
Kristin: It’s literally the first quote. Like, I was like, Jenny, the first quote that you
have in the book is you saying “a spicy meatball.” [crowd laughs]
Evan: Thank you. Thank you for saying it.
Kristin: Evan, you’ll be with us tomorrow night as well, yes?
Evan: I will indeed. [cheers and applause]
Kristin: Well. Is there anything you would like to impart with this ravenous
audience of Buffy fans, before you leave us?
Evan: I just wanna say, for anyone—
Kristin: You’re just full of it. Like—[Evan laughs] not “it,” like, not full of shit. You’re
just—he’s just like, full of all of the information that anyone ever wanted about this
show, you know?
Evan: Well, no, but like, one question I keep getting is, it’s like, is Bianca Lawson in
this book?


Kristin: Uh-huh.
Evan: And Bianca Lawson is in this book [cheering and applause] and we get all of
the Kendra gossip that was needed.
Kristin: Did you have a favorite interview? Like, was there—I mean, Sarah—we
don’t get to count Sarah.
Evan: I would say Seth Green was my favorite, [cheers] just because I’d always
wanted to know why he didn’t continue on with the show, and I finally got my
answer. So that was one. And then Marc Blucas, which I dedicated a huge—much
bigger than anticipated chunk of the book to. Because I felt like this man had a lot
to say and had been suppressing it for some time. [laughter] And I felt that he was
ready to talk, and I was ready to listen. [crowd laughs and cheers]
Jenny: Bless!
Kristin: He’s the nicest man.
Evan: So nice! So nice.
Kristin: Like, just so incredibly nice. We’ve gotten so many emails from people who
were like, “I saw Marc Blucas and he was just across the street, and then I talked to
him, and then he, like, sent me a picture of—like, he’s just—” Just a good man.
Evan: A good man, set up for failure.
Kristin: I know! It’s really—it’s really—like, we love you, Marc. He knows that,
right?
Evan: Yeah. Yeah.
Kristin: [sighs] Well. We also love you, Evan.
Evan: Yes, I love you both. [cheers]
Kristin: Thank you for being here. This was, like, a kismet thing of—like, truly. And
I was saying that to—I was like, well, maybe it wasn’t totally kismet because the
anniversary. But you didn’t even—
Evan: I had no idea.


Kristin: Plan the book around the anniver—could you—
Evan: I know. You’d think.
Kristin: But no, it’s magic!
Evan: In retrospect, I planned it that way. Yeah. [laughter]
Kristin: Right. But yeah, it all kind of came together and I’m just so glad that you
could be here with us. It’s very special.
Evan: Well, thank you.
Kristin: Yes. [cheering and applause]
Jenny: [dramatically] Into Every Generation, A Slayer is Born: How Buffy Stakes
Our Hearts. Is the book. By Evan Ross Katz. Thank you so much.
Evan: Thank you!
[cheering and applause]
Kristin: How’s everybody doing out there? How are you? [cheering and applause]
Great. So glad to hear it. I mean. We’re saving what we have till last, and I can’t
wait another freaking second to get Joanna Robinson up here. What about you?
Jenny: [yells] Joanna!
[cheering and applause]
Kristin: Joanna!
Jenny: [at a distance] Jo-ann-a! [singsong] Here she is! It’s fucking Joanna
Robinson!
[JOANNA jingle plays]
Mmm, Joanna Robinson is here to talk to us
About her feelings on the Sunnydale populace
[cheering and applause]


Jenny: Hurray! At last, Joanna Robinson has come back! To Buffering the Vampire
Slayer! [cheering]
Joanna: Hi!
Kristin: Joanna, hold my hand.
Jenny: What—what the fuck?! [crowd laughs] Joanna, hold my hand with your
other hand. [crowd laughs] Okay.
Kristin: [at a distance] You don’t wanna hold my hand?
Jenny: [sim] This is good—no! [laughter] Oww!
Kristin: And that is how lesbians have sex. [laughter and cheers] So—one of you
got way too excited about that joke. [laughter] Actually, just excited enough, I’m so
sorry. Joanna!
Joanna: Kristin!
Kristin: I just can’t ex—
Jenny: [interrupting] Joanna!
Joanna: Jenny! [laughter]
Kristin: We’re just really happy that you’re here.
Joanna: Delighted to be here. Your lipstick still looks great.
Kristin: Oh, thank god. I put my lipstick all the way deep down in my JNCO
pockets. And I was like, Joanna, you’re the last guest coming up, so if my lipstick
looks bad, you have to reach into the pocket for me. [crowd laughs]
Joanna: She’s like, you gotta root around in the back pocket for the lipstick.
[Kristin laughs] No rooting required. Yeah, we’re good.
Kristin: Welcome to Sunnydale High School.
Joanna: Thanks. Charmed. Please. I’ve never been here. This is a—
Kristin: Never been here either!


Joanna: True joy for me.
Kristin: What was it—like, what—did you have a moment? Like, when you first
walked in?
Joanna: Well, as you know, because you texted me anxiously being like, “Bitch,
where are you?” [laughter] We were running a little late, and I was driving, and so I
[inaudible] it. And I literally shrieked out, that was—that was it! That was
Sunnydale High School, oh my god! And we had to—yeah. U-ie and figure it out.
But it was delightful. Never have I been so thrilled to reach my destination.
[laughter]
Kristin: It’s very overwhelming. There’s a lot of memories here. And I know that
technically, weren’t ours in real time, but it feels like they were our memories, you
know?
Joanna: Um, yeah. Oh, something I like to talk about. Less so as time wears on,
because it dates me, but that I was the same age as Buffy when Buffy was airing,
and so it was just very…
Kristin: Yes.
Joanna: Important and personal to me, yeah. Also, I’m really glad you brought me
up here. Because I feel like your show really needed some heterosexual
representation. [crowd laughs] So…
Jenny: At last!
Kristin: Joanna, everyone—
Joanna: It’s an underserved demographic, obviously. [laughter] And yeah, I’m just
glad to—
Kristin: So Joanna, how do you feel about Xander in a speedo?
Joanna: Yeah, no, we’re gonna talk about that. [crowd laughs] Like, I cannot
access how I felt as a teenager. Because when I watch it now, I am not
popcorn-GIF’ing [Kristin laughs] watching Xander walk out. I’m like, eugh, Xander.
[laughter] Womp-womp. Yeah.
Kristin: That would be Xander’s jingle. Eugh, Xander.


Joanna: [sim] Eugh, Xander. [crowd laughs] Womp-womp.
Kristin: And then, like, later seasons is just like, not again, Xander.
Joanna: Ohh. Yeah.
Kristin: Cut it out. Yes, I’m glad that you could weigh in as a heterosexual person.
Joanna: Listen. We’ve been silent for too long. [crowd laughs] Anyone else…?
Kristin: Is anyone else here heterosexual? [a few cheers]
Joanna: Yeah! My people!
Kristin: [sim] Alright!
Jenny: Five to six people. [laughter] Incredible!
Joanna: Yeah.
Jenny: I feel so blessed right now. [laughter]
Kristin: And honestly, sitting in this room, those five to six people are unsure if
they are still heterosexual. [laughter and cheers]
Joanna: It’s a slippery slope, Buffering cast. Slippery slope. [laughter]
Jenny: Succumb!
Kristin: I always say, you know, people who are like, I don’t know, the gays,
they’re gonna turn the other people gay. Everybody’s like, that’s ridiculous! And I’m
like, nooo…[crowd laughs]
Jenny: Unless!
Kristin: You are correct, watch the fuck out. [laughter]
Joanna: Kristin’s like, do you wanna know my gay agenda? I wrote a book.
[laughter] It’s right there.
Kristin: Joanna.


Joanna: Yeah.
Kristin: You picked a clip.
Joanna: Okay, so as a representative…
Kristin: Of the straight—of the straight community.
Joanna: [sim] Of the heterosexual community.
Kristin: Yes.
Joanna: I thought that I would bring you a clip—
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Joanna: That really showed how non-toxic and just, like, really healthy—
Kristin: Mmhmm, yeah.
Joanna: The heteros are.
Kristin: Yeah.
Joanna: Yeah. [crowd laughs]
Kristin: Yeah, heteros, nothing—
Joanna: The straights, they’re okay.
Kristin: They are totally…[crowd laughs]
Joanna: Yeah.
Kristin: They’re totally okay. So, uh, let’s…[crowd laughs as clip starts]
[Clip from “I Only Have Eyes for You” starts playing]
Buffy: A person doesn't just wake up and stop loving somebody! [gun cocks]
Love is forever. I’m not afraid to use it, I swear! If I can’t be with you…


Angelus: Oh my god.
James: Don’t walk away from me—
Buffy: Bitch!
[sounds of running]
Buffy: Stop it! Stop it, don’t make me!
Angelus: Alright, just…
Ms. Newman: You know you don’t wanna do this. Let’s both just calm down.
Now give me the gun.
James: Don’t. Don’t do that, damnit!
Buffy: Don’t talk to me like I’m some stupid—[gun blasts]
Angelus: [whispers] James…
[music starts]
Buffy: [whispers] Grace…
Angelus: Don’t do this.
Buffy: [whispers] But I killed you.
Angelus: It was an accident, it wasn’t your fault.
Buffy: [weeping] It is my fault, how could I—?
Angelus: I’m the one who should be sorry, James. You thought I stopped
loving you. I never did. I loved you with my last breath. Shhh. No more
tears.
[music swells]
Buffy: [whispers] Angel?
[Angelus snarls; sounds of running]


[cheering and applause]
Jenny: That seemed fine!
Joanna: They’re fine.
Kristin: Yeah—
Jenny: That seemed good.
Joanna: Yeah, we’re fine.
Kristin: Yeah, that was super healthy.
Joanna: Yeah, through the decades, we’re fine. Obviously. [crowd laughs]
Kristin: Over and over and over again.
Joanna: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Kristin: Totally fine.
Joanna: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kristin: Yeah. Absolutely.
Joanna: When you asked me what clip I wanted to use—first of all, Jenny, I’m
really sorry that we didn’t have a trigger warning for sousaphone. Are you okay?
[laughter]
Jenny: [laughs] I’m okay. I’m okay!
Joanna: The band room?
Jenny: I’m alright, I’m alright.
Joanna: Okay. [laughter] When you first asked me what clip, I imme—I came back
to you immediately with this.
Kristin: Yeah.


Joanna: I heard Evan also suggested this episode as well, so we were in, like, a
fight—a nice fight, maybe, over this. No.
Kristin: So many feuds, on this stage. [Joanna laughs] Just endless feuds.
Joanna: But I’m really glad spider box made it up here. But—and the—it was this
or it was School Hard. And I was like, do—and School Hard didn’t make the
rotation, so I feel like we can talk about it for a second. This is our Spike intro, our,
like…fee, fi, fo, fum. [laughter] [British accent] “I smell the blood of a nice
ripe…girl.” [laughter]
Jenny: Like, Spike’s accent 1.0.
Joanna: Uh-huh. [laughter] And you’re like, mmm, Sheffield? I don’t know, what
are we doing? [laughter] By way of the East End? I’m not sure, James, but I’m
excited you’re here. Yeah, so School Hard. School Hard, incredible. But I don’t
know, I just thought of that—like, you know, them out on the balcony. It’s a whole
thing. And then, Kristin’s like, “well, okay, listen, we wanna pick a short clip. Can
you tell me, like, what the time range—?” I was like, “No, you decide.” And she’s
like, “Well, we’re gonna do the whole thing because that way, we get to watch Buffy
call Angel ‘bitch.’” [laughter]
Kristin: I mean, I couldn’t let it go. I was like, we have to see it, it’s my favorite
thing in the fucking world.
Joanna: And then we also get—we gotta get a classic Sarah Michelle Gellar,
[quietly] “Angel?” at the end of it. I mean, it’s a whole—
Kristin: And, like, a spectrum of snarl. ‘Cause we’re, like, on the far end of Season
7, but this is, like, the beginning snarl, you know?
Joanna: Yeah. It’s, um…this is a really interesting episode. [laughs] I Only Have
Eyes for You. It’s the meat of a really sort of dubious Buffy sandwich that is Killed
by Death and the aforementioned Xander in a speedo fish boy episode. [laughter]
So this, like, walled off by those things, this episode looks great. Also, shout out to
Meredith Salinger, [cheers] the great Natty Gann, future Mrs. Patton Oswald, in this
episode. But yeah, it’s—here’s—I mean, you didn’t ask me, but I’m monologuing.
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Joanna: Here’s what—


Kristin: Joanna, we wanna hear what you have to say.
Joanna: Well, here’s why this episode is so important. We’re in Season 2. Imagine
you are—I know, it’s gonna be hard. Imagine you’re a straight teenager, right?
[laughter]
Jenny: A lot of them were straight teenagers. [laughter]
Kristin: We were—
Joanna: Okay, remember? Okay.
Kristin: We were imagining that very thing.
Jenny: Once upon a time. [laughter]
Kristin: We were trying so hard. [laughter]
Joanna: And like, you’re watching this show for the quips and you’re watching it for
Sarah’s great performance. And you’re watching all this, but I’m like, also
sometimes you just wanna watch Angel and Buffy kiss. And we are in a bad stretch
where just two episodes ago, he killed Jenny Calendar.
Kristin: Ooh…
Joanna: We’re not in a good space with Angel. So they’re like, how—I know, I’m
sorry. [crosstalk]
Kristin: Did you see the window?
Joanna: I—it upset me.
Kristin: It’s upsetting.
Joanna: [laughs] It upset me.
Kristin: The first time we came here, there was just a kid doing his homework on
the ground. [crowd laughs] And I was like, do you even know what happened
here?! [laughter] He didn’t.
Joanna: Did you tell him?


Kristin: No. [laughter] It seemed too depressing.
Joanna: Listen, literal child, let me tell you a story. [crowd laughs]
Kristin: Once, there was a techno-pagan. [laughter]
Joanna: And that’s not where she dangled it from. [laughter] But yeah, so they
cooked up this great scheme to—uh, let’s let Buffy and Angel kiss, whilst being
possessed, like you do. [Kristin laughs] By some star-crossed lovers of an
inappropriate relationship of the 1950s, so. You know.
Kristin: I mean, it was a good fucking kiss.
Joanna: And like, you know, remember when Angel went over the side, but he’s
not dead because he’s a vampire? And then he was able to heal…[laughter] the
trauma loop that these ghosts were on? [laughter]
Jenny: Why not!
Kristin: Also—also, like, I would have just—it was really hard to not just play these
whole episodes. Because immediately after this scene, Angelus is just, like, at his
mansion, just like, showering. [laughter] He’s, like, scrubbing the love off of his
body.
Joanna: Yeah. Jenny.
Jenny: Something that I’ve never noticed before, until I watched this scene on an
enormous screen behind me. You all know Claddagh rings, ‘cause you’ve watched
the show, of course. It’s a little hands, little heart, and when you’re dating
somebody and they give you one, you put it so the heart goes in, right?
Joanna: Mmhmm.
Jenny: Evil Angelus isn’t just wearing eyeliner now, he also is still wearing the
Claddagh ring, but the heart is out. [crowd reacts] He is seeking. [crowd laughs] He
is on the prowl.
Joanna: Single and ready to mingle. [laughs]
Jenny: Yes. And letting people know with his Claddagh ring, even though he’s evil.
[laughter]


Joanna: My feeling is—[laughs]
Kristin: But like, where—?
Joanna: [sim] No but that is evil. My feeling is, he did that just to mess with Spike.
He’s like, how’s your girl? [laughter]
Jenny: And perhaps to mess with Buffy, too, if they ever should run into each other
and get a good look at each other’s fingers. [crowd laughs]
Joanna: Do you think he would just, like, mess with his hair—
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, oh yeah.
Joanna: [sim] Like—yeah, sort of like—make sure the points are pointy? [laughter]
And the Claddagh ring just sort of flashes in the light? Yeah.
Jenny: Oh yeah.
Joanna: Okay. Yeah.
Kristin: Do you think that Angel has, like, a little ring dish when he washes the
dishes or anything? [crowd laughs]
Joanna: Do you think Angel’s done a dish, in his life? [laughter]
Kristin: He probably washes his blood glasses.
Joanna: Mm.
Kristin: No? You think he just breaks ‘em?
Joanna: I think he breaks them in the fireplace. [laughter]
Kristin: Okay, no, you’re right, you’re right.
Joanna: He’s like, opa! You know what I’m saying? [laughter]
Kristin: Um…
Joanna: Yeah?


Kristin: Oh my god. I’m sorry, I’m just overwhelmed by your presence. I’m just
very happy to have you here. Do you—were you ever in band?
Joanna: No, absolutely not, only nerds are in band. [laughter]
Kristin: Wait, wait—
Jenny: What did you play?
Joanna: [laughs] No. I was a drama kid.
Kristin: You were a drama kid.
Joanna: Yeah. [cheers and applause]
Kristin: Jenny, you are outnumbered. You know what’s so fucking funny about her
being like, “ah-do-do-do, theater.” Is out of every person who’s been on this stage,
you are the most dramatic. [crowd laughs]
Joanna: I don’t know, Kristin. [laughter]
Kristin: No. Wait, wait—
Joanna: Have you met you? [laughter]
Kristin: I have. Wait. Just wait till the end of the evening, make your judgment
then. Okay? So you were a theater kid.
Joanna: Yeah.
Kristin: Did you ever win any trophies?
Joanna: Mmm.
Jenny: [quietly] Theater trophies? [crowd laughs]
Joanna: Yeah. Like, does like a speech competition count? [cheers]
Kristin: See? Yes, it does. Do you still have it?
Joanna: Uh. No.


Kristin: Do you remember what you—like, what is a speech competition?
Joanna: I—what is it? You…[laughs] you get up there like a really cool kid. [crowd
laughs] And you recite a long…[laughter] Alfred, Lord Tennyson poem. [laughter]
And you get a blue ribbon for your troubles, if you stay in meter and, you know,
you are passionate.
Jenny: And then, did you have a varsity jacket? For that? Too? For poems?
Joanna: No. I went to a—we didn’t do varsity at my school. We didn’t even have a
football team, so.
Kristin: Wow.
Joanna: Yeah.
Kristin: That’s like, I need an anti-patriarchy jingle for that. [laughter] I don’t have
that.
Joanna: No, no, don’t worry, we had lacrosse, so. [laughter] We were covered. We
were covered, that’s fine.
Kristin: Joanna, are you gonna be at prom tomorrow?
Joanna: I am definitely gonna be at prom tomorrow. [cheering and applause]
Jenny: What is your…style of dress? Are you going formal, are you going cosplay,
are you going some kind of mix?
Joanna: Yeah, it’s like, porque no los dos? Like, both together.
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: Yes.
Joanna: It is a…yeah. I’m excited to see what everyone’s gonna be wearing. All of
you are gonna be there, I’m really excited. Kristin has already claimed one dance
with me, but I am excited to see—
Kristin: I did.
Joanna: [sim] What the rest of you guys—[crosstalk] [cheers]


Jenny: [sim] [clears throat] Uh, Joanna, can I claim a dance with you? Too?
Joanna: Uhh…okay. [laughs]
Jenny: Okay. Thank you.
Joanna: Thanks.
Kristin: Okay, well, I have one more thing that I would love for you to do for us, if
you feel so inclined.
Joanna: Mmm.
Kristin: Which is, you did pick a scene with Angelus. And Angelus is known for his
incredible accent, and…[laughter] I just was wondering—maybe you could,
like—maybe you could just do a—like, maybe what Angel was saying when he
flipped his Claddagh ring around. I don’t know, you know, like, whatever feels right
to you? But if you…[Joanna laughs] Jenny.
Jenny: [at a distance] Please!
Joanna: I don’t know, when Jenny bears her forearm at me, how can I say no?
[crowd laughs]
Jenny: That’s what I’m saying, I’m not even wearing the jacket anymore!
Joanna: [laughs] Um. Uh. You know. [Irish accent] “I’m Liam, [crowd laughs] and
I’m here to break your heart! [laughter] Just like my heart was broken, many
decades ago!” [laughter] [cheering and applause] Yeah, uh. I mean, my accent
work is poor, but I feel like it’s right on par with David, right? [crowd laughs]
Kristin: I just like how you dive—like, that you dive in by saying, “I’m Liam.”
[laughter] You know what I mean? Like, that’s how you—
Jenny: [sim] Get into character?
Joanna: Yeah, you gotta get into the accent. Yeah, yeah.
Kristin: Are you—I don’t know if I know this, and I’m sorry to put you on the spot.
But you know, over on Angel On Top, we have a kind of a long argument going
about—


Joanna: A feud, I heard. [crowd laughs]
Kristin: Yeah. There’s a lot of things in the feud, but like, we have some
disagreements about Angel and Buffy. Spike and Buffy.
Joanna: Oh. Okay. All the relationships are bad. [laughter] [applause] And they
should feel bad. That being said…my heart belongs to Spike, obviously. [cheering
and applause]
Kristin: I knew your heart did, but I was just making sure that you also thought
Buffy and Spike were…
Joanna: Well, it’s funny. So Diana, who drove down with me today—we drove down
from the Bay Area, so it was like, six hours in the car, then we’re here. And I was
like, hi! [Kristin laughs] She was asking me, she was like, “Do Buffy and Angel wind
up together?” I was like, “well, it’s complicated.” [crowd laughs] Because Buffy is
cookie dough. She’s not done. [laughter] Making yet.
Jenny: No. [Kristin sighs] And yet, yes. [laughter]
Kristin: And yet, incredibly yes. Joanna.
Joanna: Thank you. What a joy and a delight. Aren’t they amazing? [cheering and
applause]
Jenny: How dare you. Is not Joanna Robinson incredible?! [cheering and applause]
Kristin: The best. The absolute best.
Joanna: Um, I’m gonna leave now, thank you!
Jenny: We love you! [cheering and applause] You know, if…if there wasn’t a Joanna
Robinson, there wouldn’t be a Buffering the Vampire Slayer.
Kristin: It’s really true. Do you wanna elaborate on that?
Jenny: [quietly and quickly] She made this podcast I was listening to and they’re
really good. I was like…I wanna do that! [crowd laughs] And then I harassed Kristin
until she said “okay.”


Kristin: And then I was like, you love Joanna Robin—you may have heard this story
before. But I was like, you love Joanna Robinson. We should, like, DM her on twitter
and ask her if she wants to be on the pod. And Jenny was like, [dramatically]
“Never!” [crowd laughs] And then I did it, and Joanna was like, “hell yeah!” And
like, listen. Can I get real, for a second?
Jenny: Please do.
Kristin: Because Joanna Robinson is a key part of the origin story. But also, you
know, Jenny and I have been through—[laughs] I don’t know if you’ve heard, but
we’ve been through a couple of things in the last six years. [crowd laughs] And like,
Joanna Robinson was there in Season 4 when we were trying to work through so
much hard stuff. And like—I see her little face, just like, beaming from over there.
But like, you know, Joanna just, like, helped us. You know, she really was such a
bridge in a difficult time. So—
Jenny: It’s true.
Kristin: Joanna, we love you. So just—[cheering and applause]
Jenny: Thanks, Joannaaaa!
Kristin: Okay, Jenny, we have to prepare for the big moment. Are you getting
prepared over there?
Jenny: Oh yeah, I’m getting prepared.
Kristin: Okay.
Jenny: Are you getting prepared?
Kristin: Yeah, kind of. [simultaneous cheering]
Jenny: No, them. I was asking them.
Kristin: Oh.
Jenny: It’s not all about you, Kristin. [crowd laughs] We just have a little finangling
to do, so don’t…panic.
[clip inserted]


Kristin: Ah, my cue. Yes, this is Kristin—future Kristin, speaking as the voice of
god, just to let you know that we’re about to roll into the PowerPoint presentation.
This is your cue if you are not driving a car or otherwise occupied, click that link.
You can watch along with us, you can click the slides through with us. If you’re not
watching, let me tell you—let me just tell you. You’re gonna hear people laugh,
you’re gonna hear people scream, you’re gonna hear people kinda go wild. The very
first slide of this presentation states…a fact, while we’ll prove by the end. “Faith and
Buffy had sex.” It elaborates: “Buffy and Faith absolutely, entirely had sex on
February 9th, 1999, somewhere in the town of Sunnydale, California, probably the
motel, and it was great, and they loved it, and they want to do it again.” The rest,
you’ll be able to infer. So, without further ado, let’s get back to the show.
[clip ends]
Jenny: Well! Dear friends. We’re here. We’re queer. [cheers] And…we have some
very scientific findings to report to you. We have something to talk about, that
we’ve talked about before and I’m sure we’ll talk about again. But never before
have we had…a PowerPoint presentation to go along with it. [cheering and
applause] What we would like to use the scientific method to prove beyond a
shadow of a doubt to you this evening is that…[cheering and applause] heard of it?!
And not only just that, but…in greater detail…[crowd laughs and cheers]
Kristin: Every…[pauses for cheering] every phone in the audience came out.
[laughter]
Jenny: Yes!
Kristin: I’ll link this entire PowerPoint somewhere for you all.
Jenny: It’s very important.
Kristin: Alright, Jenny.
Jenny: Listen—
Kristin: [sim] Wait, Jenny, where’s your clipboard?
Jenny: It’s right here—
Kristin: Oh.


Jenny: Don’t worry, I have eyes on my clipboard. This scientific presentation,
brought to you by Jenny Owen Youngs and Kristin Russo, 1080PhDs! [cheering and
applause] First of all. [crowd laughs periodically] What you need to know! The price
of entry. Buffy is a vampire Slayer. So is Faith! No other vampire Slayers. Just these
two. Okay? Here they are, there’s Buffy. There’s Faith. They’re the only two Slayers
alive! [sighs] And now…for the lead-up. The events taking place prior to the
other…events. [laughter]
Kristin: I just want everyone to know that earlier today, in the hotel room, Jenny
and I were just doing this by ourselves, and she did that magnifying glass over her
eye every time. Just to me. [crowd laughs] Just for me.
Jenny: It’s the only way to get to the truth, Kristin! [laughter] So! What
happened?! Well, it’s early February, 1999, if you can recall a date so distant, in the
past, through the fog of intervening years! We’re in a graveyard in Sunnydale, of
course, where else would we be? And what?! Buffy and Faith are underneath two
vamps. Let us show you. [crowd laughing] Oopsie-daisy! Their legs are up in the
air. A harbinger of things to come?! [crowd laughing and clapping] They’re not just
working, they’re also chatting. Buffy says, “I’ve never done it with Xander. We are
just friends.” And Faith counters, “What are friends for?” If not…the unspoken
implication. For banging? Their stakes, as we mentioned, they are vampire Slayers.
They continue to chat and Faith says, “Tell me you don’t get off on this!” And Buffy
says, [through gritted teeth] “It didn’t suck!”
Kristin: Jenny—
Jenny: You see! What I’m saying! [laughter]
Kristin: You are literally running through the beam of my…[laughter] okay.
Jenny: Well! Get a more powerful beam, Kristin! [laughter] We need to get to the
bottom of this! Then what happens? Well! [laughs] We have to take a look at the
hours in question. Probably the most important part of this PowerPoint
presentation! [pause] We begin in science class. At this very high school. [cheering
and applause] Can you believe it? The power, the passion, the danger! [laughter]
The goggles and Erlenmeyer flasks! Incredible. This happened here.
Kristin: It’s incredible.
Jenny: Okay?
Kristin: I know.


Jenny: Okay, so. These students, these science students, have one hour to
complete their test. One…solitary hour. Now, what does this tell us? It’s gotta be 1,
maybe 2 PM Pacific at the absolute latest, because high school gets out in the
afternoon. My high school got out at 2:15, I’m sure there’s some wiggle room in
this area. You know?
Kristin: Did you say wiggle room?
Jenny: Yes I did! [cheers] Here she comes! Here comes trouble! Rap-rap-rapping
at the laboratory window! It’s Faith. Faith? After the teacher leaves so these
students can take an honors system…test. Sure. Faith opens up this window and
says, “Hey, girlfriend. Bad time?” We very quickly learn that it is actually the best
possible time. Because Buffy climbs out that very window you see, in this GIF
[pronounced with hard G]. Or “jif.”
Kristin: GIF [pronounced with hard G].
Jenny: And they leave campus, together. Faith wants Buffy…[long pause; someone
cheers] to go to a vamp nest, so they can slay some vamps. They’re on foot.
They’re gonna travel to this vampire nest on foot. Now. How big can Sunnydale be?
[crowd laughs] Sources say not big. In Season 1, Episode 1, Welcome to the
Hellmouth, Cordelia Chase, pod favorite, says, “Oh, where, you ask, is the bad part
of town? Why, it’s a half a block from the good part of town,” making this town, at
maximum, two blocks wide? [crowd laughs] But let’s be generous, let’s give them
an hour. Right?
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Taking a long, easy stroll. As you can see, from this scale…[crowd laughs]
the evidence is irrefutable! That maybe they get to the—[laughs] it’s irrefutable, but
maybe they get to the vamp nest [laughter]—at 3 PM Pacific. Then what happens?
Kristin: I don’t know. Oh! This happens, Jenny.
Jenny: These girls. My favorites. Show up to a crypt, kick the frigging door in.
‘Cause they can. And then they whip their stakes out. In unison!
Kristin: At the same…time.
Jenny: At. The same. Time! My good people! Okay. There’s actually an important
clue, other than this just being a golden moment in television history that I would


watch on an eternal loop. There’s an important clue in this “gif” or “jif.” Uhh, Kristin,
do you know what it is?
Kristin: I have an idea, Jenny.
Jenny: Yeah, well, we made the presentation together, so it makes sense that you
would have an idea. But look! Look at this sunlight! [crowd laughs] [Jenny pants] It
looks even more sunny through my magnifying glass, actually. [laughter] And this
is important, because I did a little research. You know. And it turns out…that the
sun set in Santa Barbara, which we all know is IRL Sunnydale, at 5:36 PM. And that
sunlight that we just saw—Kristin, show it to me again. [crowd laughs] That’s not
the sunlight of a sunset! It is broad frigging day.
Kristin: You could get a tan in that sun.
Jenny: You—I mean, Angel can’t. Spike can’t. Drusilla can’t. Darla can’t. Okay.
[crowd laughs] But…uhh…Faith and Buffy could. I don’t think that’s what they’re
gonna be getting up to in this presentation. But they could. The point is, it’s friggin’
early. Isn’t it?
Kristin: Yeah, it’s wicked early.
Jenny: Hard…cut from this scene to what, Kristin? [laughter and cheers] If only—I
mean, those—these are so—Kristin found these beautiful icons and they’re so
realistic. But if only we could see what the real situation looked like. Oh wait, we
can! Because of—
Kristin: I think—I think it looks the same.
Jenny: GIF technology. Yeah, it’s the same photo.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: No. I beg of thee, dear audience, look at these women. [laughter] Look at
what is involved in this dancing. Grinding. Thrusting. A hair toss. When you toss
your own hair while you’re dancing, it’s not 5 PM in the afternoon. [crowd laughing]
It’s not 6 or 7. It is at bare fucking minimum, 8 PM, but my friends, [laughs] it’s
not. You know? It’s later. But let’s just be generous, okay, and say that maybe it’s 8
PM. We have a five-hour window, people! We’ve gotta fill that window with
something, don’t we? What. Happened? What could they have done to pass the
time? We know they didn’t go to the sporting goods store because later, when
they’re staking out Balthazar’s lair, Faith is surprised and delighted to see a sporting


goods store. So that is definitely not what they got up to. Perhaps…perhaps they
were hungry! We all know—it’s been well documented—that slaying makes Slayers
two things. And one of them is hungry! Ughhh, okay, so let’s consider the options,
right? Maybe…[crowd laughing and cheering] this is not intended to bait you,
actually. But well done, Kristin. Maybe they had a muffin at the Espresso Pump.
[laughter] On State Street. What do you think, Kristin?
Kristin: Uh, I think that would take about 20 minutes, tops, Jenny. This muffin
looks like it came out of a plastic wrapper, so maybe a couple minutes to unwrap it.
Maybe they shared it, you know?
Jenny: It’s possible.
Kristin: Maybe they talked about how much they loved blueberries. Twenty
minutes.
Jenny: Okay, yeah, that’s not enough time! Maybe. They wanted some ribs. But
unlikely, because again, later in the episode, Faith suggests that they get ribs. And
even Faith, I don’t think, eats two sets of ribs in a 24-hour period. You know? What
do you think?
Kristin: Yeah, I mean, if anyone could do it, it would be her. But I agree. Sixty
minutes, at most.
Jenny: Okay. Now what if they just decide they’re feeling very powerful, they’ve
slayed a lot of vamps.
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: Kristin!
Kristin: Mmhmm? What if? [crowd laughs]
Jenny: I’m…observing.
Kristin: So this is a cake.
Jenny: Uh-huh.
Kristin: And that’s an ice cream cone.
Jenny: Uh-huh!


Kristin: A pickle.
Jenny: Uh-huh!
Kristin: A piece of cheese. And some salami.
Jenny: The five food groups. All represented here. But even if Faith and Buffy
balled out and had a five course lunch, how long could it take?
Kristin: Absolutely no longer than two hours. One hundred and twenty minutes, at
most.
Jenny: Which would still leave a gaping void of three hours! [tinkling music plays;
crowd laughs] Good, good, good. What. Did. They do? Kristin.
Kristin: Well, maybe…like, some of…[crowd laughs and cheers] just like, a little—
Jenny: Oh.
Kristin: A little bit, like—
Jenny: Oh, okay.
Kristin: Some of that? Or maybe, like—
Jenny: Sure. [crowd laughs] The pixels! [laughter] The pixels on Jenny and Marina.
Kristin: It’s…[laughs] she’s like, “Jenny.”
Jenny: She is.
Kristin: “I’m so sorry I’m pixelated.”
Jenny: Definitely. Maybe…[crowd laughs and cheers]
Kristin: Maybe they had some fucking Totino’s, okay?
Jenny: Yeah, maybe they chased their five course lunch with some Totino’s. Pizza
snacks. Uh, we think you know what they did! We think you know. And here—
Kristin: What did they do? [crowd shouts and cheers]


Jenny: Well. There they are.
Kristin: Well. We’re wearing lab coats. You have a magnifying glass.
Jenny: I do, actually.
Kristin: We’ve done research. We’ve done math.
Jenny: Yes.
Kristin: And I think that we have proved, once and for all, that Buffy and Faith
absolutely, entirely had sex on February 9th, 1999, somewhere in the town of
Sunnydale, California, probably the motel, and it was great and they loved it and
they wanna fucking do it again! [cheering and applause]
Jenny: Okay! Yes! Do you believe us? [cheering and applause] Okay. Alright.
Kristin: High-five.
Jenny: Let me put my microphone—and my magnifying glass—okay. [sound of
high-five] [cheering] Oh, are we supposed to freeze-frame like they do? [applause]
We did it!
Kristin: Wow. You thought you were coming to just a chill podcast.
Jenny: But then we made a PowerPoint presentation.
Kristin: Now, remember when I was like, “so, Jenny’s a little dramatic.” [crowd
laughs] I mean, a couple of points, right? I get a couple of points?
Jenny: I don’t know what you mean.
Kristin: I know I’m, like, resting position dramatic, but…
Jenny: That’s true.
Kristin: But it’s like, when Jenny gets going, you know, it reaches higher levels
than I could ever hope to reach. We, um…when you came in here tonight, you got a
little card. Now’s the time—now’s the—yeah. It’s okay—
Jenny: Deploy the card!


Kristin: Take your time, take—I’m gonna move these chairs back. You can all get
your cards. Okay, so I have a couple of—you might recognize these. They’re
graduation caps. They say 2022 on them. Which is this year, and it’s also the year
of Season 7 for us and it’s the year of Season 7—it’s okay, it’s okay. It’s okay, it’s
gonna be okay. But we have two very wonderful humans who have not been up on
the stage with us yet, who are a massive part of the Buffering experience. And we
want them to come up here with us. I know I can’t get the graduation cap on my
head. I don’t know who can, but we’re gonna do our best. Alba. [cheering and
applause] Mack? [cheering and applause]
Jenny: Hurray!
Kristin: No, just—can you just, like, sit—just take a moment! And just clap for
them forever. [cheering and applause] Um, hi. Come over here to the mic.
Alba: Hello, hi.
Mack: Hello!
Kristin: We were hoping that you might…take a graduation cap.
Alba: Fuck yeah. [laughter] Absolutely!
Kristin: And we were hoping that you might sing the alma mater of Sunnydale High
School with us at Sunnydale High School.
Alba: Absolutely.
Mack: Awww.
Kristin: [at a distance] Jenny, you’re in charge.
Jenny: In charge. [laughs]
Kristin: [at a distance] We’re reading the lyrics.
[guitar starts strumming]
Jenny: Here…
Kristin: The lights!


Jenny: Ohh, the house lights. Could we? Could we have some house lights?
Kristin: [sim] [at a distance] Can we have some house lights, Larry?
Jenny: That would be such a treat for us. [cheering] Thank you, Larry.
[guitar starts playing]
Jenny, with Kristin, Mack and Alba in the background: [singing]
Under banners gold and burgundy,
With values strong and bright
Of your virtue and your glory,
We will sing with all our might
Till the earth swallows the city walls
You will have our loyalty
Sunnydale, Sunnydale, we love thee!
As we walk your hallowed hallways
With our footsteps echoing
Is it our imagination
Or is someone following?
There’ve been werewolves and vampires
So many supernatural pests
But Sunnydale, oh Sunnydale, you’re the best
All hail the Razorbacks
Godspeed you on your way
Run, swim, try not to die
On the path to victory
Remember those who came before
We’ll never see them anymore
To those who fought the greatest fight
To the class of ‘99!
From the local zoo hyena pit
To the peak of Kingman’s Bluff
We may not live to graduate,
But at least you raised us tough
You taught us life’s worst lesson:
It’s hard to stay alive
But Sunnydale…oh Sunnydale,
Only the strong survive!


[cheering and applause]
Alba: We did live to graduate. We graduated.
Kristin: We graduated!
Jenny: Oh, yeah. [laughter]
Kristin: I just cannot—there are no words that could possibly ever express how
much both of you have done over the last couple of years. And to be here in
Sunnydale High School with both of you, we’ve never gotten to hug Alba, ever!
Alba: Yeah.
Kristin: Alba and I, when we first met each other, I was like, “I thought you were
shorter” and she was like, “I thought you were taller.” [crowd laughs] It is just a joy
to have you, so thank you for being here. And hey, do you wanna know who’s DJing
tomorrow night? [cheers that become louder] Alba, do you wanna tell them your DJ
name for tom—I should tell them?
Alba: [sim] [at a distance] No, you should tell them. You tell them. [laughs]
Kristin: Okay, Alba’s—Alba texted Jenny and I and was like, okay, so—so serious.
So my DJ name is DJ Salty Spice 93. [crowd laughs and cheers] Thank you both so
much, we love you. Fuck yes. [cheering and applause]
Jenny: Well, well, well.
Kristin: Well, well, well. I don’t really have, like, that much more to say. That was
the end of the show. But I just wanted to, like, take a moment with you, Jenny. You
know? Just a moment.
Jenny: Hello.
Kristin: To be here in this space together.
Jenny: Yes.
Kristin: And to say thank you fucking so much for being here.
Jenny: Thank you so much.


Kristin: You are so important to us and our lives. And getting to be in the place
where the show was made, the show that, like, sits in our hearts very deeply. And,
like, has carried so many people in this room through very difficult times and very
beautiful times, is very powerful. And we are very excited to, you know, be making
this podcast. You’ve given us a very big gift, so thank you so much and thank you
for being here tonight. [cheering and applause]
Jenny: Yeah. Hell yeah. We did it.
Kristin: Alright. Would you like to…
Jenny: Oh, do the thing?
Kristin: Yeah, we should probably do the thing.
Jenny: Well! It’s been an honor. And a privilege.
Kristin: The “thing” is howl out, okay? [crowd laughs] What if they didn’t know?
Jenny: They know!
Kristin: Wait, I wanna put my jacket on. Alright, Jenny.
Jenny: Okay.
Kristin: Everybody ready? [cheers]
Jenny: Beautiful friends, till next time…
Jenny, Kristin, and the crowd: Awwwooooooooooooooo!
Kristin: Hell yeah!
Jenny: [sim] Thank you so much!
[cheering and applause]
