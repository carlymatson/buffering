Buffering the Vampire Slayer
Episode 0.06: Welcome to the Mailbag Vol. 4

Kristin:​ You should turn this off right now.
Jenny:​ Delete.
Kristin:​ You don’t wanna listen to this.
Jenny:​ This isn’t what you were looking for.
Kristin:​ It’s not. You... have come to the wrong place.
Jenny:​ Or we have come with the wrong thing.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Listen. Hi, it’s Kristin and Jenny. You know us, we think.
We didn’t tell you last week on our episode for “Bad Eggs”– you might
remember it. It went something like this: [imitates Jenny singing] “Bad
Eggs!” Was that good, Jenny?
Jenny:​ That was great.
Kristin:​ We didn’t tell you that because Jenny was on tour– Jenny, how was
your tour?
Jenny:​ It was so fun!
Kristin:​ Oh, it sounded so fun.
Jenny:​ It was so great. So many people brought Buffy DVDs for me to sign.
Kristin:​ We didn’t tell you that because Jenny was on tour, we are doing a
mailbag episode this week and then coming at you hot, hot, hot on April
19th with what you have all been waiting for, the episode “Surprise.”
Jenny:​ Yay!


Kristin:​ Followed immediately the following week on the 26th by the other
episode you’ve been waiting for, “Innocence.”
Jenny:​ Yay!
Kristin:​ We have a great mailbag ahead, a great mailbag, but you guys
have been stressing me out all week. [Jenny laughs] Because everyone
keeps tweeting and emailing and being like, “Oh. My. God. We’re so excited.
We’ve watched every episode. We’re ready.” And I keep emailing people
back and tweeting at everyone back and being like [in a high pitched voice],
“Uh, guys, uh, there’s just a mailbag next week, and then after that is the
one that you’re looking for.” So I feel– I have been wracked with guilt.
Jenny:​ Wracked.
Kristin:​ ​Wracked ​with all the guilt because we didn’t give you a head’s up.
We promise to always give you a head’s up in the future. Because we felt so
bad, we decided to plan our next Buffy Watch, which is open to anyone who
is a patron of ours at the dollar level or more, so all of our patrons, any of
our patrons.
The next Buffy Watch is going to be on April 24th. It’s a Monday. It’s gonna
be at 6:30pm Pacific Time, 9:30pm Eastern Time. And we are all going to
watch “Surprise” together. It will be the week that falls in between
“Surprise” and “Innocence,” or the Monday that falls between, I should say,
“Surprise” and “Innocence.” So mark your calendars for that. We will all get
to watch it together. And now you know that there are two surprises. One is
the episode, and the other one is, surprise! This is not “Surprise!” It’s a
mailbag!
Jenny: ​[laughs]
[Theme music]
Jenny:​ Hello, and welcome to Buffering the Vampire Slayer, a podcast
where usually we’re watching and discussing every episode of Buffy the
Vampire Slayer one at a time, but not this week! This week, we’ve got other
plans. I’m Jenny Owen Youngs.


Kristin:​ And I’m Kristin Russo, and this right here, this is a mailbag episode.
Jenny:​ It’s where we have mail that is in a bag.
Kristin:​ Yep. We pull it one– we pull the mail out of the bag one at a time.
Jenny:​ Like a sack, like Santa’s–
Kristin:​ Santa’s– yeah.
Jenny:​ Gift sa– erm.
Kristin:​ I don’t wanna say sack anymore.
Jenny:​ Yeah. I’m sorry.
Kristin:​ [laughs]
Jenny:​ So here we are.
Kristin:​ Yeah. We get incredible email from so many of you, and so we try
to do a mailbag episode, you know, every month and a half or so? Because
by that time we have stacked it up to the ceiling. And so we hand pick some
of our favorites and respond right here in real time on the podcast.
Jenny:​ [laughs] Right here in real time.
Kristin:​ [laughs] I don’t know. I think I’ve been possessed by an announcer
ghost.
Jenny:​ I am into it. So... how are you?
Kristin:​ How am I? Jenny said before we started recording, “Hey, what do
you think about us talking to each other before we read some of the mail?”
And I was like, “Sure? We can talk.” Are you using this as a platform to
discuss things that you don’t wanna discuss off air? You’re like, “I was
thinking about buying a new guitar.”


Jenny:​ Right. Oh god, I really was thinking about that. I’m thinking about
that every day. You can safely assume that’s always on my mind.
Kristin:​ Right, right, right. What kind of things do you wanna talk about,
Jenny?
Jenny:​ Well, we just watched the trailer for Colossal.
Kristin:​ Oh, man.
Jenny:​ And it looks… spectacular.
Kristin:​ It really looks spectacular. I saw a tweet from The A.V. Club that
was like– paraphrasing here, but it was like, “This film Colossal helped Anne
Hathaway and Jason Sudeikis understand men activists,” or– you know?
Jenny:​ Men’s rights activists?
Kristin:​ Men’s rights activists. And I was like, click.
Jenny:​ What?
Kristin:​ Yeah. And then when I clicked, I read the first couple of sentences
of the review– or no, it was an interview with, I think, Anne Hathaway on
The A.V. Club. And the first few sentences were like, “In this movie about a
woman who can turn into a giant monster in Japan by standing in a spot at a
playground in the United States–"
Jenny:​ Unbelievable.
Kristin:​ “–that also tackles things like men’s rights and female
empowerment.” I was like, “Whaaat?” And I clicked on the trailer, and I
made Jenny sit and watch it with me, and now we are really excited.
Jenny:​ So excited to see that.
Kristin:​ I mean, it seems right in our wheelhouse, if you will.
Jenny:​ Yeah. Up Jenny and Kristin alley.


Kristin:​ Yeah. Monsters, patriarchy, come on! Anne Hathaway...
Jenny:​ Hmmm...
Kristin:​ You don’t like Anne Hathaway?
Jenny:​ Well, watching that trailer just, like– I have a–
Kristin: ​Complex?
Jenny:​ Complex relationship with Anne Hathaway.
Kristin:​ You have a Hathaway complex. [laughs]
Jenny:​ I have a Hathaway complex. But I do like– I have enjoyed watching
her act. In fact, one of our very first dates was watching Rachel Getting
Married.
Kristin:​ That’s true, it was.
Jenny:​ In which she is great.
Kristin:​ One of our very first dates? It was our very first date.
Jenny:​ Well, I guess like, date.
Kristin:​ Wow!
Jenny:​ What? Gotta go. So anyway...
Kristin:​ [laughs]
Jenny:​ What a delight to be discussing exciting things with you.
Kristin:​ Yeah. You see, are you backtracking now, wishing that you had not
enticed us to talk about our personal lives? [laughs]
Jenny:​ Yeah. Let’s get to that mail. Mail’s just burnin’ a hole in my hand.


Kristin:​ Great. Well, we’re gonna do our best to see Colossal in the next few
weeks as soon as it comes out. So you should see it too because maybe we’ll
talk about it on a future podcast. Maybe, just maybe, if we actually get to
the movies. Okay. Moving right along to the controversial topic of vampire
hair.
Jenny:​ Yes!
Kristin:​ Jenny, why don’t you read to us– we’ve gotten several emails in
response to our question of whether or not vampires’ hair can grow, which
was kind of based on your perception that Angel’s hair never changes.
Jenny:​ Mhm, mhm, mhm.
Kristin:​ Right, right. A lot of people had a lot of thoughts. Mary B. and
Melissa B... not related.
Jenny:​ Uh, that we know of.
Kristin:​ To our knowledge, right. Both wrote in. So let’s hear what they
have to say.
Jenny:​ So Mary B. writes, “We do see evidence of at least one vampire’s
hair growth over the course of the show. It’s not that noticeable when it
comes to length, but the vampire in question apparently dyes their hair and
at one point has roots in their natural color.” Good eye, Mary B.
Kristin:​ Good eye, Mary B., and nice work not spoiling anything in that
telling of your noticing of the vampire hair growth. Appreciate that.
Jenny:​ Mhm, mhm, mhm. And then Melissa B. wrote in to say, “Angel’s hair
length definitely changes. It’s much longer in his vampire adolescence/the
early years. Other than explaining with metaphysics–”
Kristin:​ Metaphidics.
Jenny:​ Metaphidics. “I do have a friend that is blind that shaves by touch.
He’s quite adept at it but tells me it took years not to get cuts. Angel heals


very quickly, so I guess it’s less of an issue for vampires. Maybe there are
vampire hairstylists? Serious life questions.”
Kristin:​ Right. So Melissa is commenting both on our question about hair
growth as well as– we asked, how does Angel shave if he can’t see himself in
the mirror? Melissa, one of a couple of people, bringing something very
important to our attention, which is that there are blind people who shave
their faces and are capable of doing that. And of course, it takes time to
learn, but that Angel would be able to do something similar here with
practice and have an easier time. Because his nicks and cuts, they just seal
right up.
Jenny:​ Right, right, right. I have a related question that sprang to mind
most recently while watching the People and Entertainment Weekly Buffy
20th Anniversary reunion vibe thing.
Kristin:​ That’s the title. That’s the official title.
Jenny:​ Yeah. They called me up and said, “What should the title be?” And I
was like, “Here it is.” And they were like, “Great.”
Kristin:​ Right. We always call Jenny for succinct titles. [laughs]
Jenny: ​Rolls right off the tongue. Yes. So my question is, perhaps, does
David Boreanaz's hair grow? [Kristin laughs] Because he has had the same
hairstyle for the past 20 years. It was slightly longer in Buffy times, but all
throughout his long– the 12 seasons of Bones that he has filmed, he’s just
had that straight up in the air like he saw a ghost.
Kristin:​ Wow, is that really– does Bones really have 12 seasons?
Jenny:​ Um, yes?
Kristin:​ Wow, who knew! That’s so many seasons. Yeah. I mean, so I think
what you’re bringing to our attention, Jenny, is that perhaps we got
distracted in the lore of monsterdom.
Jenny:​ We were ignoring the question that was right in front of this the
whole time.


Kristin:​ Which is, David Boreanaz, what are you?
Jenny: ​What indeed.
Kristin:​ [laughs] So this next email comes in from Ashley, and it is for you
Jenny.
Jenny:​ Hooray!
Kristin:​ Ashley listened to our last mailbag episode, in which you told a
story about a dream you had where a witch put some worms and other
nonsense at your feet.
Jenny:​ [makes grossed-out blah-blah-blah sound]
Kristin:​ Ashley says, “Jenny, I’m listening to this mailbag episode, and I got
a major case of the shivers. When I was a child somewhere between four
and six, I had a dream that Ronald McDonald was under my bed, sticking me
in between my toes with needles.”
Jenny:​ Ahhh!
Kristin:​ I am so sorry, everyone. Ashley, this is horrible. “Still to this day,”
says Ashley, “I have a hard time sleeping if the covers are not tightly tucked
in at the foot of the bed.” Bleh! Bleh! Bleh!
Jenny:​ Ashley, that’s terrible.
Kristin:​ It’s almost as terrible as that bug that hatches out of the egg in
“Bad Eggs.” Almost. Not quite, for me.
Jenny:​ Yeah. No, no, no. The egg bug is still worse than this, but this is
pretty bad. Especially– man, Ronald McDonald.
Kristin:​ Yeah. Oof. Ronald McDonald.
Jenny:​ Of all the clowns.


Kristin:​ Oof. Rough clown, it’s a rough clown. Listen, I don’t like clowns. Not
many people, I think, like clowns. Sorry, clowns.
Jenny:​ [laughs] No offense, clowns.
Kristin:​ No offense to you, clowns, but you can be scary.
Jenny:​ But why you so creepy?
Kristin:​ Well, I mean, I think clowns have been used for as long as we’ve
been alive, as horror plot–
Jenny:​ Horror movie plot devices, sorry.
Kristin:​ Oh, yeah. Anybody seen Poltergeist? Oh, man, ​that c
​ lown.
Jenny:​ That is the worst.
Kristin: ​Yeah. Ronald McDonald ain't got nothing on the Poltergeist clown.
That clown is just something. But you know, this is terrifying, Ashley. And
there’s something, too, about the foot of the bed or under the– like, under
the bed is obviously the place where we’re always afraid of things and, you
know, what’s under there?
Jenny:​ I would take a flying leap if I had to– ‘cause my lightswitch was by
the door, but then my bed was on the other side of the room. [Kristin gasps]
So I would go running and jump into my bed to avoid getting anywhere near
the edge of under the bed where whatever was under there I assume would
grab my ankle!
Kristin:​ Yes! And ‘cause you can’t see it. ‘Cause you cannot see it. And
that’s like– not to keep talking about “Bad Eggs” again, but that’s kind of
what’s so scary about that scene too. It’s like, yeah, the bug is scary, or the
whatever it is, the baby bezoar. I hope she has a Babybzorn for her baby
bezoar.
Jenny:​ Ha!


Kristin:​ [laughs] But it’s because she can’t see where it is. The worst thing
that could ever happen to you is to not be able to see what is happening,
and you cannot see what’s happening at your feet when you’re in bed. Ugh!
It’s bad. I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry, everyone. You know what? Let’s talk
about libraries.
Jenny:​ Please!
Kristin:​ Now, this is a longer email, but it is great.
Jenny:​ But it is great, yeah.
Kristin:​ There’s a couple of emails that we’re gonna read that are a little bit
longer than our typical emails but they have made it in because they are
phenomenal. Chris B. writes in…
Jenny:​ Possibly related to Mary B. and Melissa B.
Kristin: ​[laughs] Why is everyone’s last initial B? Chris B. writes in: “As a
former late ‘90s teenager and current children’s librarian, I wanted to write
in and offer you a plausible explanation for one of the show’s most baffling
mysteries. Why doesn’t anyone, other than the Scooby gang, go into the
school library?”
Jenny:​ Dun dun dun!
Kristin:​ “Up until the mid-90s, students had to visit the library in order to
do research for papers, projects, etc. A library was pretty much their only
source for reference materials. However, with the advent of personal
computers and access to the internet, those materials became conveniently
gathered and organized on the web and/or in helpful encyclopedia CD-ROMs,
remember Encarta?”
Jenny:​ [laughs]
Kristin:​ I do, Chris B., I do remember Encarta. “By ‘96, ‘97, most high
school students could now do their research more conveniently at home or in
designated school computer labs. Compounding this issue was the fact that
while a fair number of the librarians at the time embraced the computer


revolution, many felt more like Giles, preferring card catalogues to search
engines.”
Jenny:​ I still feel that way.
Kristin:​ [laughs] “This too often led to a disconnect between student and
librarian. A growing sense that librarians, and therefore libraries, were old
fashioned or obsolete and a corresponding decreasing interest in libraries as
anything other than a glorified study space for nerds.”
Jenny:​ In quotes.
Kristin:​ Yes, “nerds” is in quotes, ‘cause we don’t– we know what a nerd is
and a nerd is not what a nerd seems… goodbye.
Jenny:​ [laughs]
Kristin:​ Chris B. continues: “Big chain bookstores also became more
widespread during the 90s, offering cheap books for sale and leading to
non-voracious readers avoiding libraries altogether. All of which leads us up
to the Sunnydale High School library, where there seems to be a total of one
computer available for use.”
Jenny:​ [laughs]
Kristin:​ “A collection heavily weighted in favor of folklore and the occult, a
librarian who, while personable and always rocking a tweed suit, didn’t like
the internet or technology in general, and a small group of wacky kids
always hanging out and talking about monster during their many,” in quotes,
“‘free periods,’ i.e. cut classes, it’s somewhat understandable that few
students would want or need to go into that library. Particularly if they
peered through those little round windows one day on the way to class and
spotted scattered piles of medieval weaponry, a blond girl beating up the
librarian with a quarterstaff or demons popping out of the floor.”
Jenny:​ Great points, great points all.
Kristin:​ Chris B., my favorite librarian after Giles. Sorry, but I’m sure you’ll
understand, Chris B., but librarian number two goes to you.


Jenny: ​You’re in Kristin’s top two librarians of all time, congratulations.
Kristin:​ Congrats. I just loved this, I don’t even have that much to say
about it. Chris B. has said all the things that need to be said. But we were
talking a little bit last episode about the mall and the position of the mall in
culture, and I think this kind of falls in the same line...
Jenny:​ Right, right.
Kristin:​ Of what the internet does to physical– what it did in the 90s and
still is doing to physical spaces.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ And I think what’s really interesting is that now we’re in the year
2017, I’m saying that clearly in case this sound file is picked up in space one
day. [both laugh]
Jenny:​ If our podcast goes on the next Voyager.
Kristin:​ Now in the year 2017, I think we’re also seeing the internet and our
progression with the internet affecting physical spaces and physical items in
a little bit of the opposite way. At first, libraries and physical products and
going to the mall sort of were pushed more away. And I think now, we’re
seeing you know, vinyl. Vinyl is a thing that I think a lot about. And like,
physical books and zines.
Jenny:​ Mhm, mhm.
Kristin: ​And things like this being popularized again as sort of like a push
back against how they were pushed away.
Jenny:​ Right, right, right.
Kristin:​ Push, push, push, push, push.
Jenny: ​Right. [laughs]


Kristin: ​You get what I’m saying, guys.
Jenny:​ I get what you’re saying.
Kristin:​ Maybe I need a trip to the library.
Jenny:​ I... would love to take you.
Kristin:​ I actually to go to the library all the time.
Jenny:​ Me too, I don’t know if you knew that ‘cause we…
Kristin:​ We– yeah, we don’t talk.
Jenny:​ Don’t spend a lot of time together so you don’t know a lot about my
day to day activities and I don’t know about yours.
Kristin:​ No, but we– Jenny and I are big library people. We work at the
library. Jenny is always taking books out from the library.
Jenny:​ Love takin’ them books out.
Kristin:​ Anyway, you were gonna say something.
Jenny:​ Who can say!
Kristin:​ What you were gonna say?
Jenny:​ Nobody, I think I was gonna say I love physical items versus
intangible zero and one items.
Kristin:​ Oh yeah, that’s us. I mean, when we moved here to California, the
friends who helped us move into our home, here in California, were so mad
at us because we had four million boxes that weighed four million pounds
each because we had so many books. That’s the kind of people we are!
Anyhow, onwards and upwards.
Jenny:​ To my favorite email of all time. Back when we watched The Dark
Age and we chatted with our pal Stuart McLean, who portrayed Phillip Henry,


who is first a dude and then a reanimated corpse in the episode. And we saw
Phillip Henry in the morgue all bruised with these splotchy bruises all over
his body and I was like, WTF? Is that the corpse norm?
And I think I said about as much on our episode of the podcast for that
episode. And immediately, if not sooner, Delisa P. wrote in: “I teach
anatomy. After a person dies, the blood in their body pools downward
(gravity) giving the appearance of bruises.” That is the entire email. I love
it.
Kristin:​ I love this email too because it was like, listen, you have a
question, here’s an answer. I don’t have any more time for any more
nonsense, here’s what I have to say about bruising. And I love it. I love
every bit of it. I think the next email is related.
Jenny: ​Yes, also from the science lab.
Kristin:​ Also from the science lab, also from The Dark Age. Nathan wrote in
saying: “Regarding the question of acid in The Dark Age–” The question was
that Ethan Rayne used sulphuric acid to burn off his tattoo.
Jenny:​ Remove the tattoo, right?
Kristin:​ Or at least that’s what we are to believe. We weren’t sure if that
was actually something that could happen. And Nathan, don’t you worry,
don’t anyone worry, ‘cause Nathan said: “Regarding this question, my
boyfriend is a scientist who works with sulphuric acid and spills it on himself
regularly. He says that it is almost certainly not an option for tattoo removal,
as he still has all of his skin.” [giggles]
Jenny:​ We should all be so lucky to still have all of our skin.
Kristin:​ Yeah, so thank you, Nathan. We’re glad your boyfriend has all of his
skin and we’re also happy to know that sulphuric acid...
Jenny:​ Is safe. Ish.
Kristin:​ Probably won’t remove your tattoo. I mean, I don’t that I would call
if safe, Jenny.


Jenny:​ Safer than we once feared.
Kristin:​ Disclaimer!
Jenny:​ Don’t drink it! Don’t drink it!
Kristin:​ Good lord. Something I think that is also super fun is a conversation
around the cross. We’re skipping a little ahead now to the episode with
Kendra. What is the episode where Kendra appears for the first time?
Jenny:​ What’s My Line?
Kristin:​ What’s My Line, where we notice that Buffy’s cross that she was
wearing, her necklace, was smaller when she was kissing Angel on the ice
rink and then throughout that episode, and many of you had cross theories.
Lauren M.: “I think it could symbolize how Buffy’s cross to bear has gotten
smaller now that Kendra is on the scene.” There’s more than one slayer and
so, you know, her cross to bear is not quite as heavy. I love that, Lauren M.
Jenny: ​Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Kristin: ​Cailey W.: “Buffy’s tiny cross might have been a wardrobe choice so
that Kendra could reasonably think Buffy was a vampire, without a
billboard-sized Jesus necklace gleaming across an ice rink to indicate
otherwise.” Thank you, Cailey, also I think spectacular reasoning here.
Jenny:​ Yep.
Kristin:​ And then someone, and I’m so sorry to whoever you are, but
someone tweeted at us and I remember the tweet but I cannot find it. But
this was my favorite theory. “I think that it will burn less because Angel and
Buffy are making out a bunch now.” So the theory here being that Buffy had
to downsize–
Jenny: ​Yeah, because we know that Angel can’t keep his shirt closed.
Kristin:​ Oh, no. For heaven's, no.


Jenny:​ Buffy really needs to minimize the size of the cross she’s wearing at
a given time.
Kristin:​ Yes. So Cailey writes additionally in her email– we heard her tiny
cross theory. But Cailey also writes to us about something else that
happened in What’s My Line. Which is when Oz says to Willow that he’s been
practicing his E flat, diminished 9th. Is that what he says? That he’s
practicing his E flat, diminished 9th?
Jenny:​ That he aspires to that.
Kristin:​ That he aspires to that. So Cailey says: “Jenny, is E flat” – oh, and
he calls it– what’s important is that he aspires to that and he calls it a man’s
chord. So Cailey says: “Jenny, is E flat, diminished 9th some kind of holy
grail for guitar? On a scale of one to the patriarchy, how offensive is the
term ‘man’s chord’?”
Jenny:​ Oh boy. So we actually talked about this in the episode and ended
up taking it out because, like, I just can’t.
Kristin:​ Jenny had some difficulty explaining this ‘cause it is– because
you’re a girl.
Jenny:​ Right, ‘cause women don’t know as much about…
Kristin:​ And you don’t– ‘cause it’s a man’s chord.
Jenny:​ [sounding dazed] What is a man’s chord?
Kristin:​ What we should have done for this episode, we should have invited
a man over...
Jenny:​ To explain…
Kristin:​ To explain. Any man actually, it didn’t even have to be a man who
knows about music because just by default of being a man, they would
probably be able to explain to us what an E flat, diminished 9th is.


Jenny: ​So the way that chords are made, they’re made up of a bunch of
different notes. And the chord has different qualities based on what notes
are selected and, you know, what notes are in or outside of the key– blah,
blah, blah.
Kristin:​ Interesting.
Jenny:​ So, E flat diminished 9th actually goes by other names as well.
Because if you shuffle the notes around–
Kristin:​ Does it go by the name the patriarchy chord?
Jenny:​ It goes by the name the patriarchy chord.
Kristin:​ Sorry, sorry. If you shuffle things around.
Jenny: ​No, no, no. It’s fine. Part of it is interpretation. So a chord could
contain five notes and those five notes could equal an E flat diminished 9th,
or the more commonly used name for it F7 Flat 9. You’ve got an E flat, a G
flat, an A, an F and a C. Right? And those notes can be shuffled around into
a different order or into a different mental order for you to understand a
different note in the chord as being the root. The E flat or the F, and then
you sort of interpret what the nature of the chord is based around where
you’re hearing the root.
Kristin:​ How did it make you feel when it was called a man’s chord, Jenny?
Jenny: ​Um… irritated?
Kristin:​ Is it a chord you can play on a piano?
Jenny:​ Yeah, sure. Yeah
Kristin:​ Can you do that for us? Can you play us– or do we need a man?
Jenny:​ Mmm, let’s get a man in here.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Can you–


Jenny:​ Actually, yeah, give me your phone. So we’re looking at E flat [plays
note] G flat [plays note] A [plays note] C [plays note] F [plays note] Listen
to that chord. [Plays notes in order] Oh, it’s actually kind of pretty. [plays
notes all together]
Kristin:​ Wow, thank you, Jenny, so much for that beautiful musical lesson,
both teaching us two things. Teaching us about the E flat diminished 9th,
and teaching us about the power… of feminism.
Jenny:​ [laughs] Is that what I did?
Kristin:​ I think so. Okay, let’s talk about ghosts. Y'all ready for a little email
here?
Jenny:​ I’m ready for ghosts!
Kristin:​ This is a great email. Jenny, would you like me to read this email or
would you like to? This is the long email. I know sometimes you don’t like to
read aloud long emails.
Jenny:​ I’d love to give it a stab.
Kristin:​ Ooh! She’s gonna do it! She’s gonna do it, folks. Jenny Owen
Youngs, reading an email from Adam T.
Jenny: ​Hold your applause! [Kristin laughs] “During the Lie to Me episode,
you mentioned some weird encounters you both had which you attributed to
ghosts. I recently came across some information that may give a scientific
explanation for ghost sightings. As an audio engineer, this information made
me really excited as it has to do with sound. As you may or may not know,
different sounds can have different physical effects on our bodies. While you
may assume that this would only apply to sounds that we can hear, even
sounds we can’t hear can still have an effect on our bodies. Many studies
have shown that even though we can’t hear sounds outside of our frequency
range, we can still perceive them and they can cause different effects on the
body.
One such range of frequencies is from seven to nineteen hertz just below the
hearing range of humans. Scientists have found that frequencies in this


range can induce fear or panic. They believe that we evolved this trait as a
source of protection against dangers like earthquakes and volcanic
eruptions.”
Kristin:​ What?!
Jenny:​ Ha! “As both produced frequencies between the seven to nineteen
hertz range. So how does this explain ghost sightings? Well, pipes commonly
found in houses and buildings can produce frequencies in this range if they
are the right size and length. So a ‘haunted house’ may not actually have
ghosts, but pipes that are producing low frequencies that are inducing fear
and panic in people. Now what about ghost sightings? Well, not only can
these frequencies affect how we feel, but they also affect how we see.
According to NASA, sounds with a frequency of 18.9 hertz can resonate
within our eyeballs if they are powerful enough.” [singing] Within our
eyeballs!
Kristin:​ [laughs] Adam T. did not sing it. That’s Jenny’s embellishment.
Jenny:​ That’s my interpretation. “This resonance in our eyeballs can smear
our vision so that a small object, like a speck of dust, can appear as a much
larger moving object. This frequency can be reproduced by exhaust fans in
buildings and further amplified by the shape of the room. So your friends
that have come into your studio and see a ghost in your chair may have just
smeared vision caused by low frequencies being produced by an exhaust fan
which are then resonating within the room. So sorry if I ruined ghosts for
you by giving you scientific explanation for them, but I just found this really
interesting and had to share it with you. P.S., sorry Kristin, I don’t have an
explanation for the bathtub faucet thing, that’s super creepy.”
Kristin:​ Yeah, that is super creepy. This is so amazing.
Jenny:​ This is gre– ama– fan– I love it.
Kristin:​ Adam, it does not make me not believe in ghosts but it does give
me a lot to–
Jenny:​ It makes me believe in Adam.


Kristin:​ [laughs] Seriously. The thing that’s bananas about this– I mean, it’s
great on so many levels. But we record in this studio, the studio where our
friends saw a ghost sitting in the chair– the very chair I’m sitting in right
now, right? Here’s a fact you don’t know.
We have had a crazy time trying to get the microphones in this office to not
have a hum that we cannot figure out where it comes from. We cannot
figure out what the microphones are picking up. They hum differently
depending on which way they’re facing in the room. We have unplugged and
replugged. It is a thing.
Jenny:​ So you think it’s ghosts?
Kristin:​ No!
Jenny:​ Oh.
Kristin:​ No, in this case with this new information, I’m just thinking, what if
there’s something in the room that is at 18.9 hertz that is messing with the
microphones, that is smearing our friends vision, and it all fits together like a
beautiful ghost puzzle.
Jenny:​ Wow, what could it be?
Kristin:​ I don’t know, we might never know, but I love this. I mean, human
brains and ooph, there’s just a lot. I still believe– I mean, obviously the
bathtub faucet, right? It turned on. And like, our friend and yours, Kate Leth,
recently did a Twitter rant about a ghost story that she had which involved a
knock on the door so…
Jenny:​ No!
Kristin:​ So those things are, you know, that’s why I hold true to my belief in
ghosts. But I do think that this is very interesting [singing] and I love it! And
I love you, Adam T.!
Jenny:​ Yes.


Kristin:​ Not related to ghosts but in similar orbits, we find the question
about the tarot cards. Here’s the deal. Molly W., Crystal C., Elise F. and
Robert W. all wrote in emails that were 427 pages long apiece. They were
amazing, they were fascinating. But they all were markedly different. They
had some overlap, some not, they talked about the two different decks of
tarot. Some of them said that certain cards were certainly within the deck.
Some of them said that no cards were able to be in the deck. There was a
whole tarot explosion–
Jenny:​ Wow.
Kristin:​ That was fascinating to me but that when I went– when I sat down
and tried to be like how do I get all this information together in a succinct
fashion? I could not do it. But I do want you all to know that we received all
of your tarot information and it has opened my mind. One of you, I believe
Molly W., said: “Kristin, I cannot believe with your history, you did not ever
get into tarot.” I would like to correct you, I did get into tarot I just did not
know about what I was doing.
Jenny:​ [laughs]
Kristin:​ You know what I mean? I certainly was like, I love a tarot deck and
I would like for– you know, I don’t wanna get the death card. But I didn’t do
the proper research, so you’re right. But also, I did have tarot, you know. I
did have the tarot experience.
Jenny:​ [laughs] The tarot experience is buying a tarot deck and looking at it
with your friends.
Kristin:​ Well, I had some–
Jenny:​ And being spooky.
Kristin:​ Yes, yes, yes, it is, Jenny!
Jenny:​ Okay. These tarot cards go great with my long velvet frock.
Kristin:​ [laughs] So we’ve gotten some questions from Twitter that I would
love to tackle if you’re into it.


Jenny:​ Yeah! What’s up, Twitter!
Kristin:​ What’s up, Twitter. Nina has a three parter.
Jenny:​ Three prongs?
Kristin: ​Three prongs to this question. “Are you going to Whedoncon?” We
are not going to Whedoncon. And I will tell you why we are not going to
Whedoncon, it is because we are going to A Camp. A camp run by
Autostraddle and me, Kristin Russo. [Jenny and Kristin laugh] It’s a camp for
queer and trans women and non binary folks and some trans men because
gender is complicated and I co-direct the camp in May.
Jenny:​ So attendance is mandatory.
Kristin:​ Attendance is very mandatory and Jenny is my wife and works with
me at A Camp.
Jenny:​ I am the special assistant of covering emotional needs to the camp
co-director.
Kristin:​ Yes, and also the composer of the official A Camp theme song,
written by you, performed by you.
Jenny:​ Is it official?
Kristin:​ It is official. You wanna know what? I’m the co-director so I can
make it official.
Jenny:​ Oh, nepotism.
Kristin:​ It happens at the same time as Whedoncon so we will not be there
this year. But if you are going to Whedoncon, you should go check out a
panel being done by Sunnydale Study Group and Hellmouthy. Two other
Buffy podcasts. Believe it or not, there are a bunch.
Jenny:​ Yeah.


Kristin:​ And the lovely people at Sunnydale Study Group and Hellmouthy
are doing a panel at Whedoncon and they have asked us if we could
participate virtually. So we’re gonna send them a special video that they will
be playing at that panel. So if you are gonna be at Whedoncon, go check it
out, have a good time, be there for us in spirit. We will be missing you from
Wisconsin where we will be with a bunch of queer and trans people having a
party of our own.
Jenny:​ Mm-hm.
Kristin: ​Question number two from Nina, “Kristin, have you watched
Angel?” Why, yes, Nina, I have. I have watched Angel, I watched Angel at
the same time as I watched Buffy in the order in which I was designated to
watch the episodes told to us by the internet. So that they– all of the
crossover episodes would crossover the way that they were supposed to and
so on and so forth. I’m sure that what you all wanna know now is are we
gonna do a podcast about Angel? We don’t know, we don’t know.
Jenny:​ TBD. As yet undetermined.
Kristin:​ When we know, we will let you know. But we don’t know. But we do
love Angel. Last question: “Do you have a favorite episode of the podcast so
far?” Do you?
Jenny:​ Oh my gosh. I love the live episode.
Kristin:​ Yeah, same.
Jenny:​ The live episode is so fun.
Kristin: ​Yeah, the live episode is my favorite episode. There’s just
something… it’s like, you know, we sit in this room, this quiet little room and
we talk to you and then later, you listen and you might have responses.
Somebody wrote in to us about how they love our podcast so much that
when they drive around in their car, they punch the ceiling when they’re out
loud laughter isn’t enough. So we know you’re having emotions out there,
but we can’t hear them in real time. But that’s why the live episode was so
fun, both to do it and to also listen back to it, because you can hear the


response in real time and the response in real time, you know, sort of fed us
and so it had this very special energy.
Jenny:​ Totally, it was so fun. It was also nice to– I mean, usually it’s us and
maybe a guest, right? But to get to hear a variety of guests within one
podcast episode, really fun. And I mean Chris, Brittani… Chris Farren,
Brittani Nichols, and Gaby Dunn all did such a great job.
Kristin:​ Oh! Dream team, what a dream team and actually we will be
attempting to do a live episode at A Camp. Speaking of A Camp and live
episodes.
Jenny:​ [singsong] Let it be so!
Kristin:​ Let it be so. We think that it will be very fun. But yeah, so those
were some great questions from Nina. One more question from Twitter from
Matt B. Man, what is with the last initials of B?
Jenny:​ All B all the time.
Kristin:​ All B all the time. “If Buffy could cross over with any other TV show,
which do you think would be perfect?”
Jenny:​ [laughs] Which do you think would be... perfect.
Kristin:​ Perfect. What is the perfect crossover episode? I mean, crossover
series for Buffy.
Jenny:​ I mean, all I wanna see is Buffy and the X Files. That’s all I want. I
wanna see…
Kristin: ​What do you think would happen if Buffy met Mulder and Scully?
Jenny:​ I think Mulder would be all Muldery and he’d be like, “oh yeah, the
Order of Taraka, yeah, I was just reading about this esoteric hyper-regional,
you know, micro niche folklore item that’s directly related to what you’re
talking about. What are the odds!” And Scully will be like, “I can’t believe in
anything–” ‘cause Scully will get knocked out every time a vampire is about


to go into vamp face ‘cause she’s always unconscious when something would
make her believe happens.
Kristin:​ Scully would be like, “Buffy, your body temperature is a little higher
than normal and I think that’s where you’re scientifically getting this extra
strength from.”
Jenny: ​Right, yeah. Ugh, that would be great.
Kristin:​ That would be great, I think they would have a great relationship as
a trio. Because Buffy sort of straddles the line, you know, between reality
and fantasy. That’s her whole character is that she’s got one foot in high
school and one foot in the monster land.
Jenny:​ Right. [laughs]
Kristin:​ So I’m in. I’m into that. I don’t know what my favorite– you know,
we have– we were just talking to my friend– our friend, Reese Bernard, who
is the person who runs Autostraddle, speaking of Autostraddle. And her first
response when we read this question aloud was My So Called Life, which I
didn’t even get a chance to think about it before she said it, but I’m gonna
tell you what. If I could push together two of my favorite TV shows, I would
do it.
Jenny: ​Mmhm.
Kristin:​ And I think– you know who would be so into Buffy?
Jenny: ​Jordan Catalano?
Kristin:​ No. Well, Jordan Catalano would definitely wanna make out with
Buffy.
Jenny:​ Right, right.
Kristin:​ But no, Rayanne Graff would be ​so i​ nto Buffy. Rayanne Graff
dressed up as a vampire for Halloween.
Jenny:​ Oh yeah!


Kristin:​ Because she’s the best and she understands the importance of
vampires.
Jenny:​ Okay, okay.
Kristin:​ And I think that Buffy, if Buffy changed schools and was going to
school with Rayanne and Angela and Ricky, I think there would be a little
tension. Because I think that Rayanne would be super excited about Buffy
and I think Angela would be kind of jealous about it. Thank you so much for
that question so now I can just think about Buffy attending the same high
school as Rayanne Graff and Angela Chase. That would make me happy.
Anyway, on to increasingly important news and emails here. We have an
email from Joseph K. Do you wanna read it, Jenny, or should I?
Jenny:​ Oh my gosh! You should read it because it’s about Cordelia.
Kristin:​ It is about Cordelia. Joseph K. writes in: “In honor of the lovely and
perfect Queen C, I thought I would share some possible origins for the name
Cordelia. According to my extensive Wikipedia research, the name is most
likely derived from the latin root Cor- or Cordus meaning heart. So it could
be a way of calling someone dear heart or true heart.” Which is what I call
Cordelia all the time, Joseph.
Jenny:​ [laughs]
Kristin:​ “Another possibility is that it comes from the French phrase cor
d’leon.” I don’t know if that’s how you say that, but it sounds good to me.
“Which means heart of a lion. A third possibility is that it comes from the
Welsh name”– here we go– “Credalealad. Credaledalad, meaning jewel from
the sea. Isn’t language fascinating?
And perhaps she was named in honor of Shakespeare’s Cordelia, who was
King Lear’s loyal and honest daughter, who proved her love by refusing to
flatter her aging father, unlike her more sycophantic sisters, and suffered a
tragic fate for her troubles. Miss Chase does possess a certain forthright
brutal honesty and we do know that Joss Whedon is a big Shakespeare fan.”
Jenny:​ Spectacular points and information, Joseph K.


Kristin:​ Yeah,.Joseph K., you might know– you might have hitten [sic] on–
you might have hit on that tip… you might have…
Jenny:​ [laughs]
Kristin:​ [laughs] Joseph K., you might know that a secret way to probably
get on the mailbag episode or to up your chances is by writing us something
about Queen C.
Jenny:​ Yeah, that’s right.
Kristin:​ Especially the origins of– the possible origins of her name. We
cannot, of course, talk about all these possible origins and talk about her lion
heart or her forthright brutal honesty without playing her jingle, can we,
Jenny?
Jenny:​ Guess we can’t!
[Jenny Owen Youngs performs the Cordelia jingle]
Cordelia (ah-ahh)
I love you, Cordelia (ah-ahh)
You’re perfect, Cordelia (ah-ahh)
Kristin:​ Well, well, well. That was lovely. Lovely as always. Thank you,
Joseph K., for the inspiration. Thank you to Cordelia for existing.
Jenny:​ Praise.
Kristin:​ Jenny, why don’t you read Leah T.’s email here because you are the
one who can answer this question.
Jenny:​ Oh boy. Leah T. writes: “Wow, I’ve been loving this podcast. If I
started talking about all the things I love and appreciate about it, I would be
talking for days.” Thanks, Leah. “Anyways, after being weeks behind, I was
catching up on the podcast on my commute and the special 20th
anniversary episode was playing.


I work for a summer camp for girls and as soon as I heard ‘Demons to
Fight,’ I knew I wanted to be able to play it at a campfire. Would I be able to
get the chords for the song as well as the okay to perform it? Finding slow
songs that are empowering, don’t focus on romantic love or home and in
general super rad is surprisingly difficult which is why I was so stoked to
hear it.” Leah T...
Kristin: ​Leah T. is not the only person who has written in to us to get
chords to some of the songs for a summer camp.
Jenny:​ [high-pitched and delighted] Mmmm! Summer camp!
Kristin:​ Right? And not the first person to write us to request the songs for
a summer camp for girls specifically to empower them.
Jenny:​ [high-pitched] Mmmmmm! Mmmmm!
Kristin:​ I can’t, we cannot, this is the best.
Jenny:​ Cannot.
Kristin:​ You can play– of course you can play it.
Jenny:​ Please do.
Kristin:​ But how will you play it if you don’t have the chords?
Jenny:​ I shall prepare them for you.
Kristin:​ That is wonderful, Jenny. I wrote to Leah and I asked Leah when
the camp started and Leah said the end of May, so…
Jenny:​ I’ll be a-hustling to make that chord sheet happen.
Kristin:​ Yes, so follow us– if you don’t already follow us, follow us on Twitter
@Bufferingcast or follow us on Facebook at facebook.com/bufferingcast and
we will get you the chords for “Demons to Fight.” And Patreons, keep your
eyes a-peeled as well, because you might get some bonus chords over
there.


Jenny:​ Absolutely.
Kristin:​ And we’ll let you know what’s where and when’s where and what’s
what [Jenny laughs] as soon as we get there. Yes?
Jenny:​ Great, great, great.
Kristin:​ Great. So this has been a lovely time.
Jenny:​ What a delight.
Kristin:​ There’s one more email.
Jenny:​ Oh, is there?
Kristin:​ There is. In a recent episode, Giles said to Buffy that he believed it
was staking time. Buffy was taking out her anger about Ted, you know…
Jenny:​ Oh yeah.
Kristin:​ Fighting a vamp a little bit too much. And Giles said, it’s staking
time, Buffy. And that inspired me to sing a song… or a part of a song on the
episode of our podcast for Ted [singing to the tune of “Closing Time”]
“staking time!” That’s all I did. I put a couple notes into the universe that
had been written for me by someone else with new words. And Brittany M.
wrote in because Brittany M. wrote the full song for us.
Jenny:​ Wow.
Kristin:​ “Staking Time,” lyrics by Brittany M. And Jenny is going to perform
the song for us all. [Jenny laughs] Brittany, thank you for your lyrics.
[Jenny Owen Youngs performing “Staking Time” to the tune of “Closing
Time”]
Staking time
Open all the caskets and stake all the vamps in the heart
Staking time


Open all the blinds and turn all the vamps into dust
Staking time
One last call for alcohol at Willy’s demonic bar
Staking time
Beat him for some info and go save the world
I know who I want to save the world (x3)
Save the world
Staking time
Time for you to go out to the cemetery again
Staking time
Won’t stop til the world’s safe and the patriarchy is smashed
So gather up your crossbow, get some holy water
Hope that you have got a stake
Staking time
Every new vamp slayer comes from some other vamp slayer’s end
I know who I want to save the world (x3)
Save the world
Staking time
Every new vamp slayer comes from some other vamp slayer’s end
Kristin:​ Wow, that was great. Jenny, great job.
Jenny:​ Thank you so much.
Kristin:​ Brittany, great job.
Jenny:​ Great job, Brittany.
Kristin:​ And you would not believe it if we told you, but we’re gonna tell you
and you’re gonna have to believe it. After we got these lyrics and we
recorded this song, we got ​another e
​ mail from Alyssa, who also sent us a
completely different set of complete lyrics to this song, which is
phenomenal.
Jenny:​ Unbelievable.


Kristin:​ Unbelievable, you all are the best. We did make a live video of
Jenny recording that song and that will be up again for all of our patrons. We
said that up at that front of the episode, in case you are new and you don’t
know what that means. We have a Patreon account, it’s found at
patreon.com/bufferingcast.
And over there, you can get all sorts of fun rewards for supporting this
podcast. One of which is joining for that Buffy Watch we talked about on
April 24th. Another of which is seeing this live video of Jenny playing this
song. And we will also put up Alyssa’s complete lyrics that were sent through
to us so you can see the alternate version as well. So check that all out over
on Patreon.
Jenny: ​Well, that does it for us for today’s mailbag. Thank you so much for
listening. I’m Jenny Owen Youngs, you can give me a shout on Twitter
@jennyowenyoungs.
Kristin:​ And I’m Kristin Russo, you can find me on Twitter @kristinnoeline,

Jenny:​ For real.
Kristin:​ See ya then.
