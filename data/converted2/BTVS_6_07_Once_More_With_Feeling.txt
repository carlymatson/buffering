Buffering the Vampire Slayer
Episode 6.07: Once More, With Feeling
[“Overture / Hello and Welcome” plays]
Jenny:​ [singing] Hello and welcome to Buffering the Vampire Slayer
A podcast where we’re watching every episode of Buffy
One by one
Mmm mmm, I’m Jenny Owen Youngs
[speaking] Whoa, did you hear that? I just sang the intro! Kristin, did you
hear that?!
Kristin:​ [singing] Hey, I’m Kristin Russo!
Jenny:​ [speaking] Oh.
Kristin:​ [singing] This week we’ve got a treat for you
We’re here to talk about—
Both:​ [singing] Once More with Feeling—
Kristin:​ [singing] The musical episode, so stay tuned
'Cause the songs run all the way through!
[speaking] Ha! Wow, um, you’d almost say that, like, maybe I’m a… I don’t
know… natural talent?
Jenny:​ [singing] Oh, directed and written by Mister Joss Whedon,
It originally aired on November 6th 2001
Kristin:​ [singing] And this is the one where —
[music intensifies]
Jenny:​ [singing] Only 16 days! Before I turned 20! Years old!
Kristin:​ Ahem! [music returns to normal] As I was saying… this is the one
with all the singing
Both:​ [singing] So buckle up for the show, 'cause here we, here we
goooooooo!
[song ends]


Jenny:​ Oh, hi!
Kristin:​ Oh, hey, Jenny. It seems like we may have been sucked into the musical
universe of Buffy this week, which is kind of keeping in our true form.
Jenny:​ You think… we just sang the intro because this week we're talking about
Once More, With Feeling? That seems like a pretty good theory.
Kristin:​ Mm, yeah. I mean, I think it is a good theory. But I—I just have this hunch
that we might explore some other—
Jenny:​ Mmm.
Kristin:​ Theories in our next song. You know, like, if there is… if there is another
song. [laughs]
Jenny:​ If there ​is a
​ nother song! Yeah, so… listen, if you're—if you're hitting this
podcast for the very first time ever, welcome. We do not usually sing the
introduction. In fact, we generally just kinda talk the whole time [Kristin laughs]
and then we have one tidy song at the end. That's how we do things. Generally
speaking.
Kristin:​ We—podcasting, colon, generally just talking the whole time. [both laugh]
Jenny:​ Yeah!
Kristin:​ That's the definition. Yes, but as we've mentioned and now also sung
about, this is not just any episode. This is Once More, With Feeling. Oh my god!
Once More, With Feeling—I—as probably you know, since I am cohost of this
podcast—I have watched this episode of television maybe, like, fourteen times over
the last couple of weeks. And—
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ You'd think, like, normally when you watch an episode of television, if you
watch it, like, multiple times, you know, its effect could perhaps dim. Uh, the
opposite happens with this piece of art. The more I watch it, the more I feel and the
more I cry, apparently. I've cried a lot this week, especially. [laughs]


Jenny:​ Mm! Mmhmm, mmhmm, yes. [dramatically] It's emotional! It's really fun!
Secrets heretofore kept close to the chest [Kristin laughs] and guarded as though it
were a dragon treasure, now brought into the light, by the tongues of the unwilling!
Kristin:​ [laughs] Yeah. And I mean, I guess we are at the top of this episode, so
talking a little bit about just, like, that big structure, right? Like, that is—apart from
giving us a musical and giving us a fucking soundtrack and giving us these
characters who we know and love, singing. All but dear, dear, Alyson Hannigan who
refused to sing—[both laugh] most of this time. But the structure of the musical,
also, and very intentionally so, is set up to, like, get us to basically, like, the second
act of Season 6. You know, it's like—
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Everybody's been carrying around a lot of shit and—
Jenny:​ Yep.
Kristin:​ What's a great way to just blow that open? Have a musical. Write a
musical—
Jenny:​ Yeah, magical singing.
Kristin:​ Where you cannot help—you cannot help but sing.
Jenny:​ Mmm! I just wanna touch on the Previously On. I just want to mention…
[laughs] that they include Spike saying, "I love you!" and Buffy making, like,
the—[Kristin laughs] the, like, "I just ate a mouthful of shit" face—and being like,
"Oh, god!" [Kristin laughs] She's like, ​so ​disgusted. It's so over the top. And I just
wanted—
Kristin:​ The lady doth protest too much.
Jenny:​ Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just wanted to turn an eye upon that, and like—
Kristin:​ Mmhmm. Mmhmm.
Jenny:​ Buffy, opposites attract, ever heard of it?!
Kristin:​ I believe Paula Abdul has a great song—
Jenny:​ Yes! Yes. Listen—


Kristin:​ Video with a cartoon cat.
Jenny:​ Buffy, just be happy you're not boning a cartoon cat!
Kristin:​ [laughs] What I wanted to say is, holy shit, these credits. This is the only
time in the series history where the credits are not the credits. [Jenny gasps] The
credits are really, really special. Everybody's in a—like, a big full moon and we get
this overture.
Jenny:​ We see a lot of things happening in the overture. The thing that caught my
eye the most is, uhh, [dramatically] women of Sunnydale and how they relate to
the written word! Anya's reading bridal magazines. Dawn's not allowed to read
magical texts. Buffy is coloring in the entire page of a notepad with a lead pencil.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Listen, Buffy's alarm rings. And she was already awake. We see
everybody getting ready for the day. And Buffy—the last shot, I think, is Buffy, still
in bed. That, like, she is awake, but she can't get out of bed. And like, as a person
who has journeyed through many a mental health experience in my life, being stuck
in your bed is—is—I mean, just the most classic manifestation of the place that she
is in.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ So I just wanted to underline that, because I think it's important. But she
does get out of bed and you're right. Tomorrow's Bride, Xander and Anya. Giles is
parenting Dawn. Tara and Willow. Buffy is distracted. Setting the scene. So Buffy is
walking in the cemetery. And hey, she's singing a song. She's singing a fucking
song.
[music starts]
Jenny:​ She's singing a song! She's, uh, you know—she's, um, well. She's going
through the motions.
[Clip from episode starts]
Buffy: ​[singing] Every single night, the same arrangement
I go out and fight the fight
Still, I always feel this strange estrangement
Nothing here is real, nothing here is right


Jenny:​ She's not, like, really feeling so much. She's numb.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ She's just trying to get through it.
Kristin:​ If we spoke to you about all of the lines in these songs that were
meaningful, we would basically just be speaking the entire lyrical book, if you will.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ But she has a couple of lines in this song that, like, really knock me over.
The biggest one I think being towards the end, where she says "I can't really see if
this is even me." And then—you know, "and I just wanna be alive," which is also
very powerful. But like, the "I can't really see if this is even me" is just so fucking
resonant—
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ And it sets us up, again, of like—this is a musical, but is it? You know what
I mean? Like, is this the musical that people who know musicals expect to see?
Alas, no.
Jenny:​ Right. Also, when she hits that big second syllable of "aliiiiive," she has
unfortunately just dusted a vampire and is definitely inhaling about a pound of
vampire dust. [Kristin laughs] I don't know how she's holding that note while all
the—the, uh, ash is—
Kristin:​ Yes, but it is glittery ash.
Jenny:​ Flying into her throat.
Kristin:​ Joss Whedon talked about this first number being really modeled, and you
can tell, after like, a Disney princess number, right? Like, this is a Disney—big, Ariel
is coming out of the ocean on the rock. And like, this last shot that Jenny is talking
about—
Jenny:​ Hell yeah.
Kristin:​ Is that. Like, that—instead of, like, the ocean wave crashing and we see
Ariel's face, it's a bunch of glittery vampire dust that sort of swirls and reveals


Buffy's face. It's beautiful and you know immediately that they have gone all in, by
watching this.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ So much of the, like, cinematography—everything looks different.
Jenny:​ Who's this friggin' goat demon with pigtail braids? [Kristin laughs] VIP of
the scene! My fave!
Kristin:​ Oh my god!
Jenny:​ My guy.
Kristin:​ "She's not even half the girl she—ow." Amaze—that is a Jenny Owen
Youngs lyric if I ever heard one myself.
Jenny:​ How dare you.
Kristin:​ What?! That was a compliment.
Jenny:​ Uh… speaking of things Jenny Owen Youngs likes… if I may.
Kristin:​ Are you taking us to the next scene?
Jenny:​ No, I'm taking us to that hunk who's tied to a tree! [Kristin laughs] With
a—fucking, his peasant blouse all open and askew. What is more powerful than a
beautiful Disney prince tied to a tree? I'll tell you what's more powerful. Buffy being
like, whatever.
Kristin:​ Whatever.
Jenny:​ Nice.
Kristin:​ You know, Buffy doesn't care about her job. She doesn't care about, like,
love life. She's not—she's just not feeling it.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin:​ She's just—she's numb on all counts.
Jenny:​ Yep.


Kristin:​ And just a note on these—so the demons do a dance, which is just so
spectacular.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ And also, like, sets you up. That like, this is a musical, it's gonna be
dealing with some heavy themes. But also, it's gonna have fun. It's gonna have
three different demons, like, choreographed. There's four main dancers and you'll
see them here as the three demons. The tap dancer is one of these four. The three
guys with the broom are these three guys, the three henchmen are these guys.
They are used over and over and over again in the episode. Jenny, if we may go to
the Magic Box. After this song has ended in this very Disney-like style, the bell
rings.
[Clip from episode briefly plays]
[door opens, bell rings]
Kristin: ​And the fucking first thing I would like to say out of the goddamn gates, is
what the fuck are these dresses that Tara and Willow are willing? What the fuck are
these dresses?
Jenny:​ Tara!
Kristin:​ What are these dresses, why?!
Jenny:​ Tara—it's Halloween. [Kristin laughs] Tara is dressed as the most beautiful
rainbow trout you have ever seen. [Kristin laughs] Glinting in the sunlight as she
nimbly navigates through the rushing waters of a beautiful forest stream.
Kristin:​ Oh my god.
Jenny:​ Of course this is what they're wearing!
Kristin:​ But it's—
Jenny:​ They are fucking witches in college! [Kristin laughs] They are ​vibing​. Do
not…
Kristin:​ Okay, fair.


Jenny:​ Step on their vibe.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Fair. So we're back at the Magic Box and also, Xander is fucking
around with these fucking doughnuts. And I wish I never knew that this was a
reference to Magnolia, [Jenny laughs] because I looked up what the quote actually
is. And it's a—I'm upset about it, okay! I'm upset about it. He says, "Respect the
cruller, tame the doughnut." And I'm not ​saying​ what the real line is, because this
is a family show.
Jenny:​ Is it?
Kristin:​ No, it's not. But I'm still not saying it. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Okay. Everyone's very reticent to reveal their individual musical goings-on
from the night before, but…
Kristin:​ [laughs] Fucking Giles. "I—I sang, but I—I had my guitar—"
Jenny:​ [clears her throat like Giles]
Kristin:​ "That would explain the background singers and the synchronized
dancing." [laughs]
Jenny:​ He brought his guitar from England. He's staying at a hotel with room
service. Where is this Sunnydale hotel?
Kristin:​ Yeah, I would like to know. I would like to know, because I'll tell you what
does not have room service and it's the Sunnydale motel. Xander is like, okay, so
let's, like—let's look into this. And he's panicked, because he doesn't wanna sing
again. Pretty much nobody, except for maybe—you know, Willow seems very
romanticized by the whole thing from the jump. But most of them are just like,
okay, let's figure out what this is, then.
[music starts]
Jenny:​ Huh.
Kristin:​ Okay! Well, before they start theorizing, Jenny. I think now—I think now
would be a good time for us to explore the musical nature of ​this​ podcast.
Jenny:​ Yeah. The piano that's playing right now [Kristin laughs] seems to indicate
that you are correct, Kristin. This seems like the time.


[“Big Fucking Nerds” plays]
Kristin:​ [singing] They’ve got a theory! Oh fuck, we’re singing!
Kristin and Jenny: ​[singing] And it sounds like there’s 20 of us.
Jenny: ​[singing] We’re on quite a journey, need an expert in TV
Kristin and Jenny:​ [singing] Maybe LaToya will know!
LaToya:​ [speaking] Hey guys.
[sing-talking] There’s a whole lot of reasons that we could be seeing
This singing from outta nowhere
Might be time in the season when shows end up needing
An uptick in listens and shares
Jenny:​ [singing in background] Ahh…
LaToya:​ [sing-talking] You don’t have a shark you can jump
But you have to get over that hump. Okay?
Jenny:​ [singing] Well, we’re not big on spectacle
Kristin:​ [singing] And there’s none more dependable
Than Scoobies who lean homosexual!
Jenny:​ [singing] So, what else could it be?
LaToya:​ [sing-talking] Well, sometimes a musical is therapeutical
Feelings need moving along
That could be another clue if either one of you
Processes better in song
Kristin:​ [singing] Jenny’s day job is singing hot tracks!
Jenny:​ [singing] But I come to this pod to relax!
LaToya:​ Okayyy…
Jenny:​ [singing] Look, we’re good on the processing


Kristin:​ [singing] Though it’s odd that we’re still singing
Jenny:​ [singing] Maybe somebody does have feelings
Kristin:​ [singing] I bet it’s Jenny!
Jenny: ​[speaking] Hey!
LaToya: ​[sing-talking] Now back to your query, an alternate theory
On tracing the source of these jams:
Perhaps one of you lesbians might be a thespian
Doing it all for the fans
Does anyone sound like the type?
Jenny:​ [sing-talking] Well Kristin, she saw Rent eight times! On Broadway!
LaToya:​ [speaking] Oh, that could definitely be it.
Kristin:​ [speaking] Excuse me, but Jenny also starred in Godspell.
Jenny:​ [speaking] I didn’t ​star​ in it, I was way in the back!
LaToya:​ [speaking] Okay, I’ve examined the evidence and I think the truth
is, you’re just singing because you’re nerds.
Kristin, Jenny, LaToya and the Scooby Nerd Choir:​ [singing in
background] Nerds, nerds, nerds, nerds…
Jenny:​ [singing] Eureka, Doctor Ferguson!
Kristin, Jenny, LaToya and the Scooby Nerd Choir:​ [singing in
background] Nerds, nerds, nerds, nerds…
Jenny:​ [singing] I think I get what’s happening
Kristin, Jenny, LaToya and the Scooby Nerd Choir:​ [singing in
background] Nerds, nerds, nerds, nerds…
Jenny:​ [singing] When you’re looking for explanations,
Usually the simplest is the right one
Baby, that’s Occam’s razor
Saying that maybe we’re just big fucking nerds


LaToya:​ [speaking] Oh, you’re ​definitely​ just big fucking nerds!
Jenny:​ [singing] Neeeerrrds…!
LaToya:​ [speaking] I rest my case! I think that’s all there is to it. The
answer was right in front of you the whole time… you dummies.
Kristin, Jenny, LaToya, and the Scooby Nerd Choir:​ Nerds, nerds, nerds,
nerds,
Nerds, nerds, nerds, nerds [repeats]
Kristin and Jenny:​ [singing] Nerds, they’re cool
Nerds, they rule
You wouldn’t be here
If you weren’t one too!
Kristin, Jenny, LaToya, and the Scooby Nerd Choir:​ Nerds, nerds, nerds,
nerds,
Nerds, nerds, nerds, nerds [repeats]
[song ends]
Kristin:​ There you have it. Straight from—how honored are we?—resident pop
culture expert, LaToya freakin' Ferguson.
Jenny:​ If somebody's gonna diagnose me with a… [Kristin giggles] chronic case of
being a nerd, I'm glad it is LaToya?
Kristin:​ Yes, huge thanks to Dr. LaToya, being here to crack that case wide open.
Jenny, I think perhaps we should now talk about the brainstorming that the
Scoobies are doing here in Sunnydale. We're hitting now the second song in Once
More, With Feeling. It's a song in three parts, three distinct—
Jenny:​ A three-fer, if you will.
Kristin:​ Yes, sort of like, what's that Queen song? Bohemian Rhapsody? It's like
Sunnydale Rhapsody here. We've got—
Jenny:​ Wow. [Kristin laughs] Um…
Kristin:​ We begin with their theories.


Jenny:​ We do, and to his great credit, Giles really smacks it right on the nose, uhh,
coming out of the gate there. Flaming hot!
[Clip from episode plays]
Giles:​ [singing] I've got a theory, that it's a demon
A dancing demon—no, something isn't right there.
Jenny:​ Unfortunately, he immediately second-guesses himself and therefore we
get a whole episode.
Kristin:​ You know what they say, you know, go with your first—go with your gut.
Go with your instinct, Giles.
Jenny:​ Uh-huh, yeah. Yeah.
Kristin:​ Turns out that you were correct, but lucky for us, we get a whole song
because you don't know it. Xander… [laughs] takes a guess and hits the witch
button. Not to be confused with the witch button later in the episode. Sorry…
Jenny:​ Oh my god!
Kristin:​ I gotta go!
Jenny:​ Yeah!
Kristin:​ Xander—Xander, though—what I love about this is that Xander's quickly
put in his place, right? He's like, "uhh—"
Jenny:​ By himself.
Kristin:​ "Witches—uh, never mind, no. Witches, like, they were totally—they were
persecuted. I've been told all about this many times. As a matter of fact, every time
I've said anything wrong about witches, I have been immediately schooled." So he's
tucked himself away in the corner, where, in my opinion—
Jenny:​ Mmm. Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ I love to see a Xander tucked away in a corner.
Jenny:​ [laughing] Uh-huh.


Kristin:​ Just… saying. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Well, he looks so neat, back there on the shelf.
Kristin:​ He does. And listen, I know—I know everybody's itching to get to those
hoppy feet and twitchy noses. And—but before we get there, I just—I at least
wanna say that Tara uses really wonderful jazz hands.
Jenny:​ Are they even jazz hands?
Kristin:​ Oh, they're jazz hands!
Jenny:​ She's—they're—they're swiveling at the wrist. And I feel like—
Kristin:​ Okay, well, I mean—[laughs]
Jenny:​ Jazz hands usually waggle. You know, and then spirit fingers move in a sort
of undulating—ah, perhaps I should create a video tutorial… so that you can—
Kristin:​ [simultaneously] You should, because I'm the only one who can see this,
and it's a delight. [both laugh]
Jenny:​ Okay. So it's time—it's time! It's time for Anya to have a big moment.
Kristin:​ [happily] Ugh!
Jenny:​ Uh, love to see this breakaway—
Kristin:​ You know—
Jenny:​ Pyrotechnic, confetti-cannon… situation.
Kristin:​ [laughs] It's just, like—nobody's paying att—like, as per usual, Anya has a
theory and they don't listen. And granted, bunnies might be a—
Jenny:​ She's a thousand goddamn years old!
Kristin:​ [simultaneously] Maybe listen—right?
Jenny:​ Maybe they should listen more often.


Kristin:​ Maybe listen to her. She says bunnies—
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ They all ignore her. There's this beautiful comic silence, where we get,
like—
Jenny:​ With crickets!
Kristin:​ [laughs] Yes.
Jenny:​ Chirp-chirp-chirp-chirp-chirp.
Kristin:​ [laughs] A little mini-musical from the crickets. And then—
Jenny:​ Uh-huh.
Kristin:​ Anya is basically like, hey, you fuckers! Listen to me! But she does it in the
form of a rockin' song—
Jenny:​ [rock voice] Waaaooooow!
Kristin:​ Bunnies. [laughs]
Jenny:​ [rock voice] Yeeeaaahh!
[Clip from episode plays]
Anya:​ [singing] Bunnies! Bunnies! It must be bunnies!
Kristin:​ She's wearing this, like, incredible, like, triangle shirt. It's like an upside
down triangle with a glittering butterfly on it. Sparks are flying—
Jenny:​ Yeah, that's some Lilith Fair shit going on.
Kristin:​ She's, like, very understandably wondering about why bunnies eat carrots.
Like, what the fuck do they need to see so well anyway? Solid question. [Jenny
laughs] And unfortunately, Anya ends her wonderful bunnies number with another
theory—uh, is a bit unfortunate because of the word choice that she uses. She uses
a word that is derogatory and a word that we do not like to hear in the universe of
Sunnydale, nor in our universe. So calling that out. Um, and then we move into the
third portion of our Sunnydale Rhapsody. It's like this togetherness song?


Jenny:​ They're all like, we're together! We're so together! We're a team! But…
Kristin:​ Not… so… believable. I mean, Buffy's—
Jenny:​ No.
Kristin:​ Yeah. Buffy's energy is very much like, apocalypse, bliggedy-blah. Fucking,
world ending, smiggedy-smah. She's just like—[Jenny laughs] been there, done it,
seen it.
Jenny:​ Mm. Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ And like, in a way that it could almost be positive. Like, we've done this
before, we can do it again! But it does not carry that energy and Giles's looks at
Buffy as she is journeying through this, like, "apocalypse, blah-blah-blah-blah."
He's just like, hmm, something seems—[laughs] amiss. I mean, yes, sir. [laughs]
Jenny:​ The weirdest part is that when they get to the end, Buffy's like, "So what do
you think we're dealing with?" and Giles is like, "I thought ​you ​said it didn't
matter."
Kristin:​ Yeah, Giles doesn't know what to do with himself, in this current position,
as we will navigate throughout the course of this musical. But yeah, he just—I don't
know. He, like—he wants to laugh with her. Like, when she makes the joke and
she's like, you know, it's do or die. Somebody says, "it's do or die" and she's like,
"hey, I died twice."
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ It cuts to Giles and he's, like, laughing in a very, like, loving, fatherly—like,
"oh, that Buffy and her fucking puns." And he just wants her to be back to normal.
She j​ ust wants to be—everybody just wants everything to be back to quote
"normal." And spoiler alert.
Jenny:​ Hey!
Kristin:​ That's not gonna happen.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm, mmhmm.


Kristin:​ Yeah, so they, like, come together but it doesn't feel very together, which
is really a heartbeat in this musical. And the next question, of course, is—[laughs]
great—a great question. "So, okay, well, is it only happening to us?" Anya astutely
asks. And Buffy's like, "let me check…"
Jenny:​ Let's check State Street, in Sunnydale.
Kristin:​ Let's—yeah, State Street has seen CGI snakes. It has seen Faith shooting
poison darts. It has seen snowfall that is near impossible to have happened, but yet
it did. It has seen so many things, [laughing] but today, friends. It is seeing—David
Fury, by the way, is the—if you did not know, this guy who's so stoked about his
dry cleaning? This is David fucking Fury. And he's singing 'cause he's so—
Jenny:​ Look at him go!
Kristin:​ He's so excited! They got the mustard stain out! They're all holding their
shirts. They're flipping, there's—it's great.
Jenny:​ Great choreo. Beautiful colored shirts, flapping this way and that. I'm gonna
come out with a very controversial opinion. I simply can't stand to see these people
talk about mustard like it's the greatest danger to your clothes that has ever oozed
across the Earth. Let me tell you something, Kristin!
["Mustard" starts playing]
Jenny:​ [singing] I’ve got a bone to pick
Mustard doesn’t stain unless you mix it with some other shit
[music abruptly stops]
Kristin:​ [speaking] Jenny…
[music starts]
Jenny:​ [singing] Like oil or blood…
[music abruptly stops]
Kristin:​ [speaking] Jenny.
[music starts]


Jenny:​ [singing] Or grease from your car under the hood, if you know I
meeeeean…!
[music abruptly stops]
Kristin:​ [yells] Jenny!
[song ends]
Jenny:​ Well!
Kristin:​ I'm glad that you got that off your chest. Really—
Jenny:​ Hell yeah!
Kristin:​ Really great. [laughs] We move from the mustard song to—back to the
Magic Box. The bell rings again, and this time, it's Dawn. She's just finished her day
at High School Musical, part three. [Jenny laughs] I don't know how many High
School Musicals are there? And she's all excited to tell them. Immediately deflated
'cause they already know. So she makes up something else.
[Clip from episode plays]
Dawn:​ I gave birth to a pterodactyl.
Jenny:​ First of all. Goals. [Kristin laughs] Second of all. Anya says, "Oh my god,
did it sing?"
Kristin:​ [adoringly] Ugh!
Jenny:​ Which, hell yeah! [laughs]
Kristin:​ Give me a sing—give me a choir of singing pterodactyls, as a matter of
fact.
Jenny:​ Yes! Please.
Kristin:​ Tara and Willow are whispering to each other, and they are—it's like, we
know—
Jenny:​ I just—they're trying to leave, they're trying to leave so bad. They're like,
"oh! The books, the texts! The volume—oh, hm!" [blusters] [Kristin laughs] And


Giles is like, "what book?" And literal—Willow literally says, "the…" and then the
word that she says is like if you take your fingers on your keyboard and you go,
like, A-S-D-F-G-H-J-K-L book. [Kristin laughs] "That's the one we need!"
Kristin:​ Report. It's a [mumbles] report.
Jenny:​ [laughs] Report.
Kristin:​ [laughs] It's just like, Willow is horrible at lying and she's been horrible at
lying forever. But apparently, Tara has also picked up this trait or has also been
very bad at lying. Because, ladies! Just say you have a—
Jenny:​ Get your shit together!
Kristin:​ Just get it together! Oh my god. So they get up to investigate the
[mumbles] report, which is what I like to call it. [laughing] And Dawn—we see
Dawn steal something else from the Magic Box. We've seen her stealing a couple of
things already—
Jenny:​ Oh my god.
Kristin:​ In previous episodes.
Jenny:​ Thief! Stop, thief!
Kristin:​ [laughs] And we move outside—I—in my notes, where I mark location, I
said "outside in… Sunnydale central park?" Like, where… [Jenny laughs] where are
we? It's beautiful.
Jenny:​ Yeah, where are they?
Kristin:​ It's very, very beautiful. I learned, in watching some of the commentary,
that [laughs] of course, because—it's not funny. But we laugh as the world ends.
What else can we do? [Jenny laughs] The babbling brook, the water that is—you
know, any time you see running water, you know things are gonna get pretty sexy.
But—
Jenny:​ Oh, yeah.
Kristin:​ The hilarity of this is that that stream—the water had to be pumped into it,
because it was totally dry. [laughs] Because, you know, LA is a desert and stuff.


Jenny:​ Uh-huh, uh-huh. [laughs]
Kristin:​ Anyway, they're walking in the park. And we have this, like… [sighs]
moment with these boys? Um…
Jenny:​ Backpack boys.
Kristin:​ Backpack boys.
Jenny:​ Backpack boy squad!
Kristin:​ [laughs] And they're like, check—so, here. They're checking Tara out. Fair.
Tara, of course—of course they are. But also, are they checking Tara out? Or are
they like—
Jenny:​ They don't look like they're checking her out. They're like—
Kristin:​ What the fuck is that dress? [laughs]
Jenny:​ Is the ren faire in town? [laughs]
Kristin:​ [laughing] What—yeah. What—what are you wearing, ​ma'am​?! But—
Jenny:​ They are wearing—they are wearing, like, long-sleeved t-shirts and
backpacks and cargo khakis.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ And they are naturally looking at Willow and Tara, being like, hmm.
Kristin:​ [laughs] What—what are these—?
Jenny:​ I have been meaning to pick up a broadsword. [Kristin laughs] Maybe I
should inquire. [both laugh]
Kristin:​ So that—
Jenny:​ Prithee, m'lady, couldst thou point me unto the—did you know that the
renaissance faire that goes to LA every year is called the Pleasure Faire? [laughs]
Kristin:​ Ohh, my god. Wow, we're about to fucking go right there, aren't we?


Jenny:​ Yeah, we are!
Kristin:​ We're heading to the Pleasure Faire without pass and go. [laughs] Tara
makes this joke that is just—she's like, "oh, they're looking at me? I'm cured!" And
you're like, okay. Okay, Tara, we get the joke. [Jenny laughs] And then Willow
comes in right on her heels and is like, "Well, what am I supposed to do? I'm not
large with the butch." And I'm like, who the fuck wrote these lines?
Jenny:​ Uh… [laughs]
Kristin:​ I know the answer.
Jenny:​ [sarcastically] Oh, definitely a queer woman wrote these lines, right?
[Kristin laughs] For sure.
Kristin:​ [sarcastically] For sure! For sure! I mean, if I sat down to write this scene,
these are exactly the lines I would have written.
Jenny:​ This is—this is what we call, uhh, a sibling test to the Bechdel test. It's the
Buffering test. [Kristin laughs] If you close your eyes and you can picture a queer
person you know saying the dialogue… [Kristin laughs] then it passes. [laughs]
Kristin:​ "Not large with the butch!" [sarcastically] I say that all the time. [both
laugh] So, anyhow…
Jenny:​ [stilted British accent] I have re​searched!​ [laughs]
Kristin:​ So anyhow…
Jenny:​ [stilted British accent] I have re​searched!​ Relevant lingo! [both laugh] And
my findings are thus!
Kristin:​ So, um… basically, Tara is like, how could they possibly be looking at me?
And then she's like, I know what they see in me and it's you. And—[sighs]
Jenny:​ [laughing] 1080P HD. [both laugh]
Kristin:​ Okay—we'll get there. Just hold your fucking [Jenny cackles] gay-ass
horses, for one goddamn second. [laughs] I just wanna say one thing, which is that
I've always been really upset about this line and this concept that, like, Tara wasn't
anything before, like, Willow. Like, I just didn't like the narrative. And then I was,


like, starting to be like, okay. Like, I do think that Willow, like, helped Tara
understand who she is. And the first line of this song…
[Clip from episode plays]
Tara:​ [singing] I lived my life in shadow
Never the sun on my face
It didn't seem so sad, though
I figured that was my place
Kristin:​ And I was like, okay, okay. Maybe it wasn't as much, like, Willow bringing
Tara out of her shell as it was, like, a direct call to, like, that Tara was—you know,
couldn't be out. Like, couldn't be out to her family and couldn't sort of like live as
authentically as she can now.
Jenny:​ Mmm.
Kristin:​ That not only Willow, but like, all of the Scoobies stood up for her. And if
that—if that is, like, the—if that's what's happening, if that's part of what's
happening, then I'm like, very much here for the messaging a little bit more than I
was before.
Jenny:​ Mm, mm.
Kristin:​ Okay, so now I've said my fucking feelings, Jenny. And you can just
fucking stomp around in your 1080P HD boots, okay? [laughs]
Jenny:​ What. The. Hell? [Kristin laughs] First of all, these girls are doing fucking
glitter magic in public.
Kristin:​ If my hand could shoot out glitter, I would constantly be moving it like
that.
Jenny:​ I know Sunnydale is a place where a lot of things happen, but… I'm
operating under the assumption that everyone's still trying to keep their mystical
business on the down-low. [Kristin laughs] I do wanna say, I love how they get
from the park into the bedroom.
Kristin:​ Yeah.


Jenny:​ They twirl and there's a bit of, like, Gondry-esque magic that happen—they
twirl all the way! Their love is so powerful! That they twirl! [Kristin laughs] From the
park! Into the bedroom!
Kristin:​ They fall into bed. Just a note that there's a stuffed puppy on the bed.
Like, just—
Jenny:​ Lord. Have mercy.
Kristin:​ An interesting choice for—
Jenny:​ Ladies. [laughs]
Kristin:​ For this scene. Well, like, it's fine that Willow and Tara have a stuffed
puppy on their bed.
Jenny:​ Sure, sure, sure.
Kristin:​ But it's interesting to me that the props department was like, okay!
Jenny:​ Let's make sure—
Kristin:​ [simultaneously] The ladies are gonna fuck! Let's put a stuffed puppy on
the bed! [both laugh]
Jenny:​ Let's get the mood ​dialed.​ [Kristin laughs] Kristin, I know you have some
things to say about this portion of the libretto.
Kristin:​ [laughs] I do, I do. The erotic novel sometimes writes itself. I will read
now to you—it's been a minute. An erotic novel. [speaking slowly] "The moon to
the tide. I can feel you inside. Surging—"
Jenny:​ In her heart.
Kristin:​ Excuse me, I'm performing. [both laugh] [speaking slowly] "Surging like
the sea. I break with every swell. Spread beneath my Willow… tree." Wooowww!
Jenny:​ I distinctly recall you saying earlier in this taping that this is a family show.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Like, how? How? This is what's amazing to me, is that, like, the
network had, like, a big fucking hullaballoo about these two kissing. But like, these


lyrics, they were like, "yeah, yeah, I guess that's fine? I don't—yeah. Sure." [both
laugh] Like! I just! This is, like, porn. This is porn—this is porn.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ The amount of times Tara talks about having Willow inside—
Jenny:​ [simultaneously] This is actually—you know what this reminds me of?
Kristin:​ What?
Jenny:​ Have you ever checked out Missed Connections on Craigslist?
Kristin:​ [laughs] I know of it, but I haven't spent a lot of time there. But I know of
it.
Jenny:​ The two sections that I have checked out in the past are Men for Men and
Women for Women. And the Men for Men ones are like, [gruff voice] "ohhh! [Kristin
laughs] We were in this bookstore or gym or whatever and we went in the back and
we engaged in the following activities. [Kristin laughs] And I would love to, like, do
that again! Ahhh!" [Kristin laughs] Whatever. And then, the Women for Women
Missed Connections are like, [dramatically] "ohhh, but the arrow of Diana has
pierced my heart! [Kristin laughs] You! [both laugh] You lit up the sub—the last car
on the F train at approximately 7:23 PM and I remember because I was on my way
home to watch HGTV! [Kristin laughs] Or perhaps, Buffy the Vampire Slayer! And
oh! You looked upon me! And then—"
Kristin:​ Oh. My god.
Jenny:​ "You looked away! And lo! Your stop came and went. And then I was alone
again!"
Kristin:​ Wow.
Jenny:​ You know?
Kristin:​ Standing ovation for fucking Jenny Owen Youngs. [laughs] Apparently—
Jenny:​ Well, there's just a—there is a—I mean, it's not—you know, it's not all one
thing all the time.
Kristin:​ Right.


Jenny:​ But those were the general vibes that I gleaned from [both laugh] checking
out the Missed Connections on Craigslist.
Kristin:​ You, left your stuffed puppy on my bed. [Jenny laughs] Me, looking for you
ever since. [both laugh]
Jenny:​ You, the most beautiful rainbow trout I had ever a-spied! [both laugh] Me,
the equivalent of a dry river bed in Los Angeles until you! [laughs]
Kristin:​ Okay, that's it—
Jenny:​ Pumped ceaseless gallons!
Kristin:​ Where's my—pull her off stage! [both laugh] You're cut off! Youngs. Wow.
Willow goes off-screen. [sarcastically] I don't know where. I don't know where she
goes. [both laugh]
Jenny:​ She looks like she's got a job to do. She looks like she has a sense of
purpose, is what I can say. [both laugh]
Kristin:​ I mean, honest to god, I don't even know how she could possibly deal with
the weight of that dress! I mean, what is happening?
Jenny:​ Well, I'll tell you what's happening. [both laugh] Fucking levitation, Kristin!
["On Ren Faire Dresses and Levitatilingus" plays]
Jenny:​ [singing] I’ve got a question, a tiny question
Don’t you think something like, say, levitation
Would require an awful lot of concentration?
Kristin: ​[singing] Maybe this is just how witches do it every time they do it
Tara doesn’t look surprised to me
Jenny:​ [singing] But what about the vending machine?
Jenny and Kristin:​ [singing] The people have a right to know!
The people have a right to know!
Kristin:​ [singing] I’ve got a question, a tiny question
It’s hard to hit a target when it’s moving


Especially when you are also floating
But do we even know if Willow’s floating?!
Jenny:​ [singing] It’s impossible to say
What’s going on just out of frame
Kristin:​ [singing] Whatever it is, it’s pretty gay
Jenny and Kristin:​ [singing] The people have a right to know!
The people have a right to know!
Jenny:​ [singing] In the heat of the action
Was that a magic-gasm?!
This is a family show!
Kristin:​ [singing] What happens when it’s over?
Do they fall down or keep floating?
Jenny:​ [singing] Do the people really have a right to knoooooow?
Kristin:​ [singing] I say nooooooooooo!
[song ends]
Kristin:​ In defense of Willow and Tara. Through that musical journey, Jenny, I
realized that we don't have the right to know. As much as we wonder upon the
goings-on—
Jenny:​ Mmm.
Kristin:​ We do not have a right to know.
Jenny:​ It's truly none of our business.
Kristin:​ None of our business. Although I will say that one of our listeners posited
that perhaps far, far away, there was a vending machine that they were simply
trying to move. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Mmm! [laughs]


Kristin:​ It was just really far away, you know? Some vending machines, when
they're right there, you just have to hold hands. But like, if they're far away, you
have to take a different—some different measures.
Jenny:​ Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kristin:​ Is all.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm. Mmhmm! Hard cut, as Tara sings "You make me com… plete."
Kristin:​ The cut to the Magic Box is so hard that we don't even get the bell.
[laughs] And of course, there's more of this, like, Dawn shit, of them being like,
don't talk about sex in front of Dawn!
Jenny:​ Well, and Giles saying, "I'm sure they're making every effort." [Kristin
laughs] And Xander being like, [blusters]. [both laugh] And Dawn is like, "Guys, I
know about sex and gay people, it's fine."
Kristin:​ Yeah, but—like, does she? Does anybody?
Jenny:​ Well!
Kristin:​ As previously mentioned, does anybody know? [both laugh] I don't think
so.
Jenny:​ She knows as much as the rest of us.
Kristin:​ [laughs] So, um… we cut from this scene out to the street, the alley, what
have you. We get this incredible tap dance number, so incredible that it ends
[laughing] in flame.
Jenny:​ Um, listen.
Kristin:​ Be careful!
Jenny:​ I don't—
Kristin:​ Tap dancers, be careful.
Jenny:​ I don't want anybody to die [Kristin laughs] and I know that, like, people
dying is bad, especially in the context of this show. You know?


Kristin:​ Mmhmm.
Jenny:​ You wanna prevent all deaths, particularly mystical ones, whenever you
can. But… the threat of, like, oh no, I might be compelled to dance until I
spontaneously combust [Kristin laughs] just doesn't have the, like, weight of a
threat that I want—although I guess it is a musical. So keeping that in mind, you
know, maybe—maybe it's, like, where the road of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and
musicals converge—
Kristin:​ Mmhmm.
Jenny:​ Is like, they compromise and they're like—
Kristin:​ Right.
Jenny:​ "Okay, people are gonna die. But it's gonna be absolutely ludicrous."
Kristin:​ [laughs] Well, and I mean, like, it's a one-two punch, right? It's like,
there's a physical threat and an emotional threat. And the emotional threat is much
larger than the physical threat, but you need the physical threat to move
the—move the people along.
Jenny:​ To really—yeah, raise the stakes, sure.
Kristin:​ Because we don't recognize emotional threats nearly as quickly as we
recognize [laughing] physical threats, so. After this man bursts into flames, we get
a little reveal. We don't get the full reveal quite yet, but we pan up to who we know
is Sweet. And he says, "That's entertainment."
Jenny:​ [laughing] Counterpoint. Personally. Watching someone dance until they
spontaneously combust [Kristin laughs] is not entertaining, to ​me.​ [both laugh]
Okay, so we head over to Xander and Anya's house where they are waking up
surrounded by, among other things, five model convertibles, two bobbly head fuzzy
dogs that you put in the rear of your car, [Kristin laughs] and two—not one, but
two lava lamps.
Kristin:​ Oh my god, yes. They are in bed, surrounded by accoutrements. And, um,
they're talking about breakfast.
Jenny:​ Uh-huh.


Kristin:​ Xander's like, "Do you want me to make you waffles? An omelette?"
They're wearing fantastic—the costuming is fantastic in this. Xander is wearing silk
pajamas that are maybe, like, two sizes too big for him.
Jenny:​ Uh-huh.
Kristin:​ And Anya is wearing this, like, silk—silk—what I've learned are called tap
pants. They're, like, short—like, shorts. But they look like a skirt. They're silk, and
like, a bralette that matches. She's looking good. [Jenny clears throat] They're
looking great together. You alright over there, Jenny?
Jenny:​ [coughs] [blusters; Kristin laughs] She's also wearing matching heels.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Oh, yeah.
Jenny:​ But pajama heels.
Kristin:​ Pajama heels, yes.
Jenny:​ With floofs.
Kristin:​ You know they're pajama heels 'cause they are fluffy. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. She is quite literally the cutest of the
Scoobies. Look at her go. Look at her go!
Kristin:​ Aw. She really is. She—she wake—you know, they're about to get out of
bed and it's very clear they're bursting into song. And their whole song is written in
this very, like… retro—she says it later. She says, like, a retro-pastiche. But it's
written in, like, a Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire kind of a way.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Very classical—
Jenny:​ Very like, golden age of Hollywood musical kind of—and the costuming to
match, you know?
Kristin:​ Yes. Totally. Anya comes out, starting us off on this song, saying
basically—not basically, literally—"vengeance was mine but I'm out of the biz. The
name I made, I'll trade for his." Whew! That's a line. That's a line.


Jenny:​ Uh-huh!
Kristin:​ Xander's—Xander's lyrics are written quite well, almost as though the
person writing the lyrics had a deep understanding of the character. [laughs]
Because there's a couple of, like—like, lines where he goes to say something really
dirty, but then, like, pivots. And it's fun—it is funny, when it comes back around at
the end of the song. But he says, like, "Wrapped in your tight… embrace, tight
embrace!" And like, ew, Xander. Gross, man. [Jenny laughs] Fucking get it
together. But it's very—it's, like—as much as I'm like, "gross, Xander," I'm like, this
is a good lyric—like, this is such a Xander lyric. This is exactly what Xander would
sing if Xander was singing.
Jenny:​ Uh, yes. Agree. Good. It is good.
Kristin:​ It is good.
Jenny:​ In defense of Xander, those cheeses do look pretty bad.
Kristin:​ Those cheeses look horrible! Listen—
Jenny:​ Don't eat those cheeses!
Kristin:​ Do not! Throw those cheeses away immediately. They are—
Jenny:​ Those cheeses have evolved into, like, medicine, maybe? But also maybe
just garbage.
Kristin:​ [simultaneously] Oh, yeah, yeah. They're—totally. What is it? Penicillin?
Jenny:​ Penicillin?
Kristin:​ Yeah. Yeah. [laughs] You're set. So, um, this whole song is just them
singing the things that they don't wanna tell each other about what they don't like
about each other. And unlike a song we will get to in the training room, they are
hearing everything the other person is saying.
Jenny:​ Yeah. Yeah.
Kristin:​ And some of it is silly, like skeezy cheeses and hairy toes and whatever.
But some of it is, like, very real. Xander specifically thinking that Anya thinks he's
ordinary, right? He's not gonna be successful, he's not gonna be able to, like, give


her what she needs. And Anya saying "like it's all just temporary" and that
throughline of, like, feeling like—
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ She loves this person and wants to commit to this person, but it always
feels like he's not quite there, he's not quite committed. And so, the funniness of it
is offset, if you really, you know, listen to the song, with the, like, under current of
some of their marital or premarital issues, if you will. Anya—Emma Caulfield is, like,
obviously, you know, a trained—at least trained-ish dancer. She knows what's she
fucking doing. And fucking—
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Nicholas Brendan is just like, ba-da-ba-da-ba-baah! Like, he's just
like—[laughs]
Jenny:​ Honk!
Kristin:​ And it's so—the, like, combo of it is really—
Jenny:​ [simultaneously] Which is nice!
Kristin:​ It is. It's really, really—
Jenny:​ Yeah, it's very them.
Kristin:​ Yes, totally.
Jenny:​ We do get, like, a lot of camera angles that we don't normally see that do
really bring to mind, you know, a more cinematic—
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ Majestic musical approach.
Kristin:​ Totally. And we haven't said this yet, but I'm sure that if you're listening,
you know this, that this episode was shot in widescreen. And so, a lot of the camera
work is different and more complicated than other episodes. But also, like, just the
fact that it is in widescreen makes the spaces feel different, because we can see
more of them at once—


Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ Than we have ever seen before. So anyway. They have told each other all
of their secrets. They fall into the chair, hysterically laughing, in a, again, classic
move. But they are definitely not laughing on the inside. [Jenny laughs] Because
they're like, fuck! We have these issues with each other and, like, we were keeping
them all secret and now they're out—all out on the table.
Jenny:​ You know. Listen. As two people who have been married—in fact, to each
other—we might actually be able to help them out. You know what I mean? They
seem to be forgetting one important piece of the equation.
["You Can Always Get Divorced" starts playing]
Kristin:​ Oookay. We're really—we're just gonna do it.
Jenny:​ [yelling] This one goes out to all you people who are afraid to commit!
[Kristin laughs] Oh!
Kristin: ​Oh my god.
Jenny:​ Relationships are hard and scary! Except…
Kristin:​ Nothing like a musical to put it all on the table.
Kristin:​ [singing] Xander and Anya
It’s been weighing on ya
You’re scared that you might make
A really big mistake
Jenny and Kristin:​ [singing] But take it from two girls who’ve been down
the line
There’s no knot so knotted it can’t be untied
You can always get divorced
You can always get divorced
You might even be better friends if you reverse your course
Yeah, you can always get divorced
Jenny:​ [singing] You might discover
He hogs all the covers
Kristin:​ [singing] Or she might get incensed


And start taking vengeance
Jenny and Kristin:​ [singing] But listen two girls with experience
If shit gets bananas, you just hit eject
You can always get divorced
You can always get divorced
You might even be better friends if you reverse your course
Yeah, you can always get divorced
[Kristin and Jenny making rhythmic wedding bell sounds]
Jenny and Kristin:​ [singing] You can always get divorced
You can always get divorced…
Jenny and Kristin:​ [speaking] We did it!
[song ends]
Kristin:​ We did do it.
Jenny:​ And so can you!
Kristin:​ Who can say that they have both gotten divorced and sang about it? And
harmonized about it? You know? We're—there—
Jenny:​ Mmm.
Kristin:​ There's poetry in that, if you do ask me.
Jenny:​ Hmm.
Kristin:​ [laughs] You know, Jenny, this seems as good a time as ever to, like, go
get a glass of water. Maybe a glass of wine. And take a little intermission from a
sponsor or two?
Jenny:​ [gasps] [sings] Let's go out to the lobby!
[AD BREAK]
Kristin:​ Okay, so. Xander and Anya are walking with Giles. This is a very long
shot—actually learned that this shot—this was, like, the twenty-first time they had
done this shot. So—


Jenny:​ Oh my word.
Kristin:​ Watch it again with the knowledge that these actors and dancers have all
done this twenty times before the shot—the take we're seeing. Because it's really
long and there's a lot of elements. And I think that the first thing that we come to…
is Marti fucking Noxon.
Jenny:​ Wow!
["Wow Wow Wow" starts playing]
Jenny:​ Wow! Wow! Wow!
Excitement unlocked!
Wow! Wow! Wow!
Holy shit, that rocked!
[song ends]
Jenny:​ Mm-hmm!
Kristin:​ What a singer! Wow, wow, wow indeed. Marti Noxon has some fucking
pipes, man. And—
Jenny:​ Yeah, sounds great.
Kristin:​ She sounds great and she's—[laughs] she's singing really a song—like,
very relatable content for me. "It isn't right, it isn't fair, there was no parking
anywhere." Like, she's not like, "I didn't see the hydrant, I didn't—" you know what
I mean? Like, her argument is simply, "There was no parking, so the rules don't
apply." Which is a—which is—[laughs]
Jenny:​ But then she continues and says, "I think that hydrant wasn't there."
Kristin:​ [laughs] And ​then​ she continues and says, "I'm just a poor girl, don't you
care? Hey, I'm not wearing underwear." So—
Jenny:​ Nice!
Kristin:​ Just—all the tactics. You know, when I used to be an actor, it was sort of
like, what's your motivation and how are—like, what do you want and how are you
gonna get it?


Jenny:​ Mmm.
Kristin:​ She wants to not have this ticket and she's got a lot of tricks up her
sleeve. [laughs] She's going for all of 'em.
Jenny:​ Yep. Yep!
Kristin:​ Pretty sure she's leaving with a ticket, so sorry about that, Marti.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ We see more dancing. There's a couple dancing, which, hey. Little
egg—little Easter egg, this is the choreographers. The two choreographers, they
were put in last minute, those two little dancers, doing their little things.
Jenny:​ Ohhh.
Kristin:​ Yep. And the broom dancers are dancing. There's just a lot going on.
Jenny:​ Giles is telling Xander and Anya that he was able to examine a body of a
spontaneously-combusted person, while the police were busy taking "witness
arias."
Kristin:​ [laughs] I missed that! See? You can—
Jenny:​ [singing operatically] I saw a person… go up in flames, while he was
dancing! [sings tune] [speaking] I don't actually know what the musical
requirements of an aria, but—
Kristin:​ Unbelievable.
Jenny:​ That's my approximation. No offense intended to our opera enthusiast
listenership.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Oh, they—I'm sure they enjoyed that, heartily.
Jenny:​ Mm. [laughs]
Kristin:​ And yeah, Xander—like, so—Giles is also like, you know, "Buffy doesn't
seem like herself." It's just like, yeah, dude! Fucking let me—


Jenny:​ I wonder why, you fucking fuck!
Kristin:​ [laughs] And Xander, to his credit, is like, dude—essentially, like, dude.
Like, she's easing back into it. We just yanked her out of a fucking hell dimension
and like, whatever. And Giles is like, "I'm helping her as much as I can." To which I
say, are you though, sir? Are you? Anya does a nice pat-pat-pat [laughing] on
Giles's shoulder to comfort him.
Jenny:​ Aww!
Kristin:​ Very cute. [Jenny laughs] Though, that widescreen—that widescreen is
really—
Jenny:​ Oh, yeah.
Kristin:​ Showing itself here in this fucking—
Jenny:​ Oh, yeah.
Kristin:​ Entry to Spike's lair, where we can see the upstairs and him coming up
from the downstairs all at the same time. Hot, hot, hot!
Jenny:​ Buffy acknowledges the whole musical thing that's going on in Sunnydale.
Kristin:​ The way that Spike—like, the way that Spike explains that he does, in fact,
know. Even though he says he's immune, but he knows that the musical is
happening, is because he saw a 600-pound demon "making like Yma Sumac." Yma
Sumac—I was like, I didn't know who Yma Sumac was. And I was like, what is
Spike referencing? So I looked up Yma Sumac, Jenny, and Yma Sumac was a
Peruvian coloratura soprano. I don't know if that's how you say that, but that is a
soprano who is, like, a type of operatic soprano that can do agile runs and leaps
and trills. She had a five-octave fucking range.
Jenny:​ Mmm!
Kristin:​ And she was an international success. She—and I—like, literally, when I
discovered this, I started playing her. I, like, sent the Spotify link over to friends
and we were just, like, fucking—you need to—as soon as you're done with this
podcast, go to Spotify or wherever you listen to music and fucking listen to some
Yma Sumac. 'Cause it's amazing and also, just of course, Spike. Right? He's
like—he's a man of taste, you know? He's a lot of things, but he's a man of taste.


So I just love to think about him just, like, jamming out to some Yma Sumac in his
lair. [laughs]
Jenny:​ For reference, some—some… musical giants who also have five-octave
ranges are folks like Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey.
Kristin:​ She's just such a badass and I was very delighted to find her through Once
More, With Feeling. [both laugh] Anyway.
Jenny:​ Spike says, "Oh, so you've come to pump me for information." And she
says, "What else would I want to pump you for?" [Kristin laughs] [clears throat]
Spike's like, "[blusters] I'm so immune, it's hilarious that everyone else is singing
but me. Anyway, you should really get going, ah, look at the time. [Kristin laughs]
You've gotta—you've gotta go on." And then he's like—
Kristin:​ This is like—
Jenny:​ [sings] "I died!" And they both have looks of utter disgust and
disappointment on their faces, and it is real funny.
Kristin:​ I mean, it honestly could be, like, the best moment in the series is their—
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Complete—
Jenny:​ They're both just like, "oh god, it's happening!"
Kristin:​ Like, Buffy is ​way m
​ ore upset about this moment than she was when she
had to kill Angel. You know what I mean? Like, this is far more—
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Upsetting to her. [laughs] She—
Jenny:​ Meanwhile, I'm just, you know, wondering, what does Spike plug his fridge
into again? Like…
Kristin:​ Mmm. He gets the—you know—
Jenny:​ A fridge generally needs, like, a dedicated—you know—


Kristin:​ Yeah, demon—demon electric. You know. You know.
Jenny:​ Oh, right, right, right, right.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ Okay. [both laugh]
Kristin:​ Yeah, so. Oh my god. He's so embarrassed, he can't stand it. She's so
embarrassed, she can't stand it.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin:​ And he says this first line that you already said, Jenny. And right after, he
gets his, like, first line out—or right before, I don't even know. He just says, "Mm,
mm."
[Clip from episode plays]
Spike:​ [singing] And why you come to be with me,
I think I finally know…
Mm-mmm
Kristin:​ So sexy that I die every fucking time.
Jenny:​ Well, I don't want you to die, Kristin.
["Problematic Fave" starts playing]
Jenny: ​But counter offer. We could, instead—
Kristin:​ Mmm.
Jenny:​ Sing a song about it!
Kristin:​ Mmm! You know—
Jenny:​ If you want to!
Kristin:​ That sounds great, Jenny. That sounds fucking great.
Jenny:​ [singing] Mmm ba ba ba mmm ba ba ba mmm ba ba ba


Spike looks good
Mmm ba ba ba mmm ba ba ba mmm ba ba ba
Spike looks good!
Kristin:​ [singing] Well, I never wanted to be fabric before
'Til I saw that black tee hugging all your contours

Who clawed his way out of the grave
But you’re still our number one problematic fave!

Oh my fucking god, it’s Joanna Robinson!
Joanna: ​[singing] Well, no one stands a chance against your cheekbones
I would save you all my mini marshmallows
Jenny:​ [singing in background] She'll save the marshmallows
Joanna, Kristin and Jenny: ​[singing] Mmm ba ba ba ba mmm ba ba ba ba
ba mmm ba ba ba ba
Spike looks good
Mmm ba ba ba ba mmm ba ba ba ba ba mmm ba ba ba ba
Spike looks good
Jenny:​ [singing] Slurpin some blood, Spike looks good!


Kristin:​ [singing] A sensitive stud, Spike looks good!
Joanna:​ [singing] Long leather coat, Spike looks good!
All:​ [singing] Smokin a smoke, Spike looks good!
Joanna, Kristin and Jenny:​ [singing] Mmm ba ba ba ba mmm ba ba ba ba
ba mmm ba ba ba ba
Spike looks good
Mmm ba ba ba ba mmm ba ba ba ba ba mmm ba ba ba ba
Spike looks good…
Spike looks good!
[song ends]
Kristin:​ Hot diggedy dog! [Jenny laughs] Well, that's my favorite part
about—[laughs with Jenny] somewhere, that is my favorite part about bursting into
song. I mean, who knew that just by feeling turned on by Spike, such a beautiful
musical ode would happen? [laughs] Also, Joanna fucking Robinson!
Jenny:​ Also—yeah! She just dropped in out of nowhere, disappeared—
Kristin:​ Fucking—
Jenny:​ In a puff of smoke. A big part of musicals, I think, is sort of the timely and
magical appearance of things when you need them most.
Kristin:​ Mm. Mm. Yeah. Definitely. Anyway, so back to Spike. He is singing, just
like we just were. He is singing a song called Rest in Peace. "You're ashamed of
what you feel," he says to Buffy.
Jenny:​ Mmm!
Kristin:​ "A whisper in a dead man's ear—" you think it doesn't make it real. He
doesn't say "you think," but that's what the line, uh, intones.
Jenny:​ Mmm!
Kristin:​ It's very—this is a—like, this is classic problematic fucking fave shit right
here. Because he's like, I—I'm only dead to you. Being with you touches me more
than I can say, so get the fuck out of here! [laughs] Like, just like—


Jenny:​ Ohh.
Kristin:​ It's not, you know, grounded in a very—
Jenny:​ Well…
Kristin:​ Mature emotional space, if you will. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Hey, no, I think Spike is drawing a boundary.
Kristin:​ He's trying.
Jenny:​ He's saying, I won't be a plaything any longer.
Kristin:​ Mmhmm. Mmhmm.
Jenny:​ Uh, come back when you're serious—
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ About these washboard abs.
Kristin:​ No, and I—I joke about, like—mature is, of course—like, I said it to make a
point. But it's not the right word, because it's—I think this is very relatable content.
Like, if you have a crush on somebody and they don't like you—they don't like you
back, right? I mean, that—it's not actually the truth here. But like, you want to say,
like, okay then I can't hang out with you anymore. Right? Like, I can't see you
anymore. But then you're constantly like, okay, but maybe just one time. You
know, like, it's very hard, I think, for so many of us to take care of ourselves—
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ When we know that, like, what we're doing isn't good for us, but like, fuck!
It just feels really good anyway! It's very hard. So I do understand Spike. I don't
think you're immature. I think that you have a big heart. I mean, he has—this line,
which I think Joss said was the first line he wrote in this song, was: "If my heart
could beat, it would break my chest." Which, like… credit where credit is due.
Jenny:​ So great.
Kristin:​ Yeah. Fantastic—


Jenny:​ It's a great line.
Kristin:​ Fantastic line. And seems, like, so accurate in Spike describing what he's
feeling. That like, he can't—and he's, like—he's so attracted to Buffy and is like, you
need to leave. Because if I can't have you, then like, I can't just constantly be
wanting for you. And he also can't kill. Like, let us not forget that, like, so many of
the, like, desires that Spike has are inaccessible for him to, like, meet. And he—he's
speaking about Buffy, for sure. But I think that he's just, like, feeling a lot of
fucking stress and frustration and overwhelm—
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ In a lot of ways. And he does not like to talk about those things, but
ha-ha! Joke's on you, Spike, you're in a musical. [laughs]
[Clip from episode plays]
Spike:​ [singing] I know I should go
But I follow you like a man possessed
There's a traitor here, beneath my breast
And it hurts me more than you've ever guessed…
Jenny:​ Ahhh!
Kristin:​ Ah! Spike!
Jenny:​ I just—Kristin—have a question.
Kristin:​ Mm.
Jenny:​ Have you ever been to a nighttime funeral?
Kristin:​ [laughs] You know, um, I haven't, Jenny.
Jenny:​ Maybe funerals are cheaper if you book the night shift.
Kristin:​ Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like having your wedding on a Sunday, you know,
instead of a Saturday.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin:​ You, like, save some money if you do the post-7 PM… [laughs] funeral.


Jenny:​ Yeah. Yep, yep, yep.
Kristin:​ He jumps on the coffin. Great, great imagery of this, like—
Jenny:​ Very good.
Kristin:​ Surfing coffin situation. And then he, like, throws everything around. And
Buffy and he tumble… into…
Jenny:​ Oh, no!
Kristin:​ An open—you know that—
Jenny:​ Oops!
Kristin:​ You know that feeling when you accidentally tumble into an open grave
with the person you love?
Jenny:​ With your crush? [Kristin laughs] Yeah! A story as old as time.
Kristin:​ So, you know. They have a moment. Buffy is on top of Spike, which is
accurate in—you know, just saying. That is how this would go. And she leaps out of
the grave and runs off into the distance, because hell no, she's not gonna do that.
And Spike has probably the most comedic moment in the entire episode. Where his
little peroxide head just pops right out of the grave and he's like—
Jenny:​ Yep, yep, yep.
Kristin:​ "So. So you're not staying then?"
Jenny:​ Just like Groundhog Day. [both laugh] Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ "So then… okay, so then you're really gonna go. Okay." [laughs] It's very
cute.
Jenny:​ Oh, dear.
Kristin:​ Ugh.
Jenny:​ Oh, dear!


Kristin:​ Cut to—
Jenny:​ Over at the Summers' house, Dawn is upending her plastic, transparent
backpack. [gasps] Is this backpack symbolic of everyone trying to keep their
secrets but being completely [Kristin laughs] unable to?
Kristin:​ Wow!
Jenny:​ Helpless in the thrall of Sweet's, uh, forced singing.
Kristin:​ Um, so Tara is here, to tell Dawn what's going on. But this scene is here
for a couple of reasons, one of which is for Dawn to be the catalyst for Tara to
realize that something horrible—truly—has happened. That Willow has done
something truly horrible. And Dawn says to Tara, "I'm glad you guys made up."
And Tara's like, "What are you talking about?" And Dawn's like, "You don't have to
pretend around me." And then there's this beautiful reprise—what would you call it?
It's not a reprise. It's just like, the—a chord. A bit of the—the… melody from Under
Your Spell plays in a very sad way. And we haven't talked about Christophe Beck
yet in this episode. But Christophe Beck was responsible for a lot of the score and
also created the ballet we're—the music to the ballet that we're about to go into.
That was Christophe Beck, too. The guidance—this reminds of, like, when I work
with you, Jenny. Like, basically, the guidance that Joss said he gave to Christophe
Beck was like, "Can you make it sound like Peter and the Wolf?" Which is like,
literally—
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Yeah. Like, that's, like—that's what I do. And I'm like, okay, go. Ready, go!
[laughs]
Jenny:​ Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we can tell that it's a sad version of Under Your Spell
because the chords are a little more mournful, and also the melody is being played
by maybe, like, an English horn or an oboe.
Kristin:​ Ugh, this is awful. This is awful. Tara has this, like, moment of realization
all at once, where she puts her hand to the flower that she—at the beginning, we
didn't say. But at the beginning, she sort of found that little flower on the bed and
she pinned it to her shirt. And so she now has her hand over that flower and she's
realizing—'cause she's already—I mean, obviously. They've already set the stage
for the fact that Willow is using magic in really irresponsible and dangerous ways.
Tara has been the first one to really, really push back on that. I mean, Giles has
pushed back, but not like Tara. Tara sees it much more intimately and so, in an


instant—and you know this instant. Like, if you've had a moment like this, you
know it. It's like where all of the little threads that have been sort of, like, out
there, suddenly are like, whoonk! And this is what happens to Tara in this moment.
And—
Jenny:​ Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin:​ She doesn't know exactly what the flower is. And probably, that's the
worst part of, like, an experience like this—
Jenny:​ Ugh.
Kristin:​ Is like, the—
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ "Oh my god" and then the—like, then she's gonna run and she's gonna go
to—you know, we will see that she goes to the Magic Box and we'll get there in a
minute. But it's just awful. Like, the knowing but the not-knowing? Like, maybe if I
look this up in a book—
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ It will say, like, your most beloved gives it to you and then,
presto-change-o, you're wearing a fucking trout dress. You know? Like, oh great,
that was all it was. [Jenny laughs] No, it wasn't. It was a lot worse than that. But
we'll get—we're gonna get there. I'm getting ahead of myself. So Tara leaves.
Jenny:​ [dramatically] Then! What do we have here, but a Dawn left alone! [Kristin
laughs] Alone with a copy of a teen heartthrob magazine on her little vanity—
Kristin:​ Ugh!
Jenny:​ With Justin Timberlake's curly-headed little sixteen-year-old face on it.
Soo… staring down into the middle distance, Dawn wonders to herself, feeling
lonely and sad and forgotten…
[Clip from episode plays]
Dawn:​ [singing] Does anybody even notice?
Does anybody even care?


[music gets sinister; Dawn screams]
Jenny:​ And you know who cares? A huge fucking ventriloquist dummy!
Kristin:​ Yeah. Seriously. Fucking three, as a matter of fact. They care a lot.
Jenny:​ I hate their faces.
Kristin:​ This moment of Dawn—you know, we've cast people in our universe as
various voices, right? Bess Rogers as Willow and Chris Farren as Xander. And all
manner of things, right. And we cast Gaby Dunn as Dawn and this moment was
really, real—like, it really hit for me, you know? Because it's like—[laughs]
Jenny:​ Oh, yeah.
Kristin:​ Dawn's like, [sings] "Can you pay attention to me?"
Jenny:​ Gaby Dunn could really teach Dawn a thing or two. About being noticed!
Kristin:​ [laughs] Do you think that, like, Beetlejuice—if we say her name a third
time, she will just mystically appear?
Jenny:​ You know, considering who we're talking about, I'm kinda surprised she
didn't just appear after the first time you said her name. [Kristin laughs] But why
don't we give it a go? Three, two, one…
Kristin and Jenny:​ Gaby Dunn?
["O! To Be Mentioned!" starts playing]
Gaby:​ [singing] Well, I couldn’t help but overhear
You said the magic words, my dear
One’s “Dunn” and then the other is “Gaby”
Jenny:​ [singing in background: Gaby, Gaby…
Gaby:​ [singing] You know what to expect when you mention me…
Jenny:​ [singing in background: Mention me…
Gaby:​ [singing] Did I ever tell you all about
The time that I almost made out with—


Jenny:​ [speaking] Gaby, we’re actually kind of in the middle of something
right now?
Gaby:​ [singing] Okay, byeeeee…
[song ends]
Kristin:​ Uh, well, I guess our summoning trick worked. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Thank you? [Kristin laughs harder] Question mark? To Gaby Dunn. Always
here when mentioned.
Kristin:​ Always here when mentioned.
Jenny:​ We love you, Gaby.
Kristin:​ Wow.
Jenny:​ Okay.
Kristin:​ Um, we have moved—Dawn has been kidnapped. And she is now in the
Bronze, the sort of repurposed Bronze. Like, it's recognizably the Bronze, but
it's—specifically, the stairs have been changed, and we'll find out why in a minute.
[Jenny laughs] But Dawn wakes up on the pool table. And we get Dawn's ballet,
and Michelle Trachtenberg is, of course, trained in ballet and said to Joss, how
about I don't sing? How about I dance?
Jenny:​ But she also sings. [laughs]
Kristin:​ She does. And she does a gre—I think that Dawn does a good job singing,
actually.
Jenny:​ Yeah, she sounds great.
Kristin:​ Or Michelle—[laughs] Dawn. Michelle Trachtenberg does a good job
singing. And so there's this beautiful—it's really quite nice. I really love the dance.
Jenny:​ [simultaneously] Yeah, the dancing is nice.
Kristin:​ And it's, you know, these three—these mannequin heads, I know we
mentioned them, but they're terrifying. And they're actually not—they were, like,


made elsewhere. These are not from, like, the main Buffy crew of, like, makeup and
props. They had these made—I can't remember the name of the company.
Jenny:​ Mmm.
Kristin:​ But they're outsourced, and I feel like you can kinda tell. Like, they're
scary in a way that seems, like, a little out of universe. And—
Jenny:​ Mmm.
Kristin:​ They do this dance around her, et cetera. She does—and Michelle
Trachtenberg does this slide across the fucking floor. Like, this is really Michelle
Trachtenberg—
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ Sliding on her fucking knees across, she hits these stairs I was talking
about. And tippity-tap-tap-tip. Here comes some tap shoes down the fucking stairs.
And we've seen Sweet, we've seen him. But now, we're really gonna get Sweet.
We're gonna get a song from Sweet called What You Feel. And we have—we have a
segment that we'd like to go to before we talk about—
Jenny:​ Yes.
Kristin:​ All that is the amazing Hinton Battle, and all that is the demon, Sweet.
Mack and Alba would like to jump in here and say a little something.
Jenny:​ Yes!
["Stereotype Buffet" starts playing]
Alba:​ [speaking] Hey Mack. So they made a monster. A ​Black​ monster. What
a surprise, right? I know. Let’s talk about it.
Mack:​ [singing] This week on the Hellmouth, we’ve got some things to say
About the shit they’re serving up at the stereotype buffet
Tap dancing through the twenties in that forties-style zoot suit
Chuck Berry’s taste in the underage and Superfly slang to boot
Alba:​ [singing] Tired of seeing a bad guy every time I see my face
White people are not qualified to be writing and conveying race
'Cause when y’all try our culture on, nuance gets erased


Why don’t you just step aside, give people of color space
Alba:​ [speaking] Sing it, Mack. Tell 'em.
Mack:​ [singing] At first glance, you’ll wanna dance, but take a closer look
Sweet’s jazz tune is just a page from Robert Johnson’s book
Sweet is cool, Sweet is smooth, until you realize
Some straight white guy justified these sinister stereotypes
Alba:​ [singing] While you show up for fashion, no matter time or place
I wanna watch my favorite show and trust the characters with my face
Instead I must resign myself to the writer’s vapid taste
Mack and Alba:​ [singing] Ampata, Forrest, Kendra, Trick: BIPOC copy paste
Alba:​ [speaking] Still not done. Still have to talk about more!
Mack:​ [speaking] In Sunnydale, bad things always happen to girls who are
underage.
Alba:​ [speaking] Like getting sacrificed in a frat-house basement to a giant
demon snake.
Mack:​ [speaking] Or being assaulted by the varsity swim team (who would
make a tasty ceviche).
Alba:​ [speaking] But of course, the biggest predator would be—
Mack and Alba:​ [speaking] A Black man with the devil’s face
Mack and Alba:​ [singing] To everybody listening who still think Sweet’s
badass
Consider this your crossroads, 'cause now we have to ask:
How much of our little song did you need to research?
Privilege provides the luxury to watch passive from your perch
Alba:​ [singing] So don’t force us to compromise, we’ve had e-fucking-nough!
Mack and Alba:​ [singing] We should tell our own stories—
Mack:​ [speaking] It’s really not that fucking tough.


Kristin:​ Fucking!
Jenny:​ Oh my god!
Kristin:​ Fucking! Hell yes. Mack, Alba. If you are just hitting this podcast for the
first time, Mackenzie MacDade, Alba Daza. Alba Daza is our producer. Mack
MacDade is our consultant and facilitator. They've both been working with us for
some time and are so badass. As a matter of fact, the last episode in our feed is a
conversation between Mack and Alba where they use the themes and storylines in
Buffy the Vampire Slayer to talk about the BIPOC experience of invisibility. They are
just fantastic. And thank you for that beautiful segment. Probably the best segment
we've ever had.
Jenny:​ Certainly the most musical segment we've ever had.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Certainly, certainly. And you know, to just sort of, like, jump off
of what some of what Mack and Alba were just singing. Slash saying. You know,
Sweet—so Sweet is played by Hinton Battle. First of all, Hinton Battle is… un…
believable? He's amazing. He's won three Tony awards. He was actually the first to
play the Scarecrow in Wiz. He's just fucking incredible. And the thing about—I
mean, there's a lot to unpack here. But one thing that I wanted to touch on
specifically is that, you know, in the United States, at the very least, musicals have
a long history that is related to racism and segregation. And a lot of charact—a lot
of black characters who were put in musicals around the time of integration—hard
air quotes on that word, "integration"—were given these, like, very performative
numbers. They were, like, you know—to do a song and dance.
And part of the reason for that was because a lot of the theaters at the time
wouldn't play shows—wouldn't play movies—these are movie-musicals I'm talking
about. They wouldn't play movies with black characters in them, with black actors
in them—black performers. And so the fact that the black actors in these musicals
didn't have anything to do with the plot whatsoever made it very easy for studios
and theaters to cut out those parts and still play an entirely white musical movie,
without losing any of the story line. And so, you know—we could do a whole
podcast just talking about this.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ But I think it's important to point out. And also that, like, Sweet is—I
mean, Sweet is literally the plot of this. Like, if there was no Sweet, there would be
no Once More, With Feeling. So that's great, but you know, to Mack and Alba's
point—one of their many amazing points. Sweet is the demon, he's the villain. And


so, there's just—you know. If we had seen more nuanced treatment of characters
of color in the series up till now, you know, that would be one thing, but we
haven't. And even in this episode, we saw two or three black vampires who were
just there to be dusted. You know, and we've talked about it—
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ A bit and we'll continue to talk about it. But it is important to have
conversation around this.
Jenny:​ Much to our point about the Buffering test with regards to Willow and Tara,
speaking lines of dialogue clearly written by extremely straight people. We can
further assume—actually, we can do better than assume. Because we know—
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ That there were no people of color in the writers' room. There was
no—nobody in a position to—
Kristin:​ Mmhmm.
Jenny:​ Veto or weigh in. Nobody's perspective outside of the existent writers' room
was sought.
Kristin:​ Right. Right.
Jenny:​ To consult on this, right?
Kristin:​ Right, exactly. And that's—I mean, you know—
Jenny:​ And it shows.
Kristin:​ It sure does. It sure does. And that is not, like—you know, Sweet is a—is a
character that, I think, we love. And like, Hinton Battle is an incredible performer.
But it's just that, like, this imagery of, like—to quote the song that was just sung,
"A black man with the devil's face" is—this is what we often see. We often see black
characters either not painted in detail, or when the detail is painted, it is a
villainous detail that we get. Right? And so—
Jenny:​ Right, right.


Kristin:​ Just—I do wanna say that Mack and Alba wrote that song with Jenny. The
three of them wrote that song together. So all of the—all of the lyrics are from
Mack and Alba, and they also performed it. Which is the only song in this whole
collection that was written by others and they just—it just—standing ovation, bravo.
Thank you so much for being a part of the Buffering fam.
Jenny:​ Hell yeah.
Kristin:​ Uh, can I ask a question?
Jenny:​ You may.
Kristin:​ Why does he take his mouth off, Jenny? Why does he take his mouth off?
Why did they do that?
Jenny:​ I don't know!
Kristin:​ Why'd they do that?!
Jenny:​ Why couldn't he just make his suit change color a couple more times?
Kristin:​ [laughs] Just—
Jenny:​ Instead!
Kristin:​ Every time it happens, I'm like, but why? But why. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Yeah. That sucks. The suit color change rocks.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ The thing that I love the most about this is when the door flies down from
the ceiling [Kristin giggles] and crashes onto…
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ The floor. I love that.
Kristin:​ God, if you were a theater person, those doors—they're like—they're just,
like, so anchored in my memory of being a theater kid. Just, it was, like, always
just like, the frame and the door. And you'd go—[both laugh] you'd walk around it
and like, knock on it to start your scene. [both laugh] Ahh, but it is—and I mean,


this performance, you know—all of the—all of the actors—you know, the regulars, I
should say, on this series. A lot of them did, like, vocal training and worked for
months and like, on weekends and at nights, or whatever, just all over the place to
learn these dances and these songs and everything. And they do a wonderful job.
But it is quite clear when fucking Sweet does this song that now we are in the
presence—
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Of—
Jenny:​ Yeah…
Kristin:​ Someone who is a remark—
Jenny:​ [simultaneously] Somebody who knows—a professional.
Kristin:​ Yeah. He knows his way around a fucking Broadway stage and it shows.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ He's a—just an unbelievable dancer, an unbelievable singer. And like, he
doesn't have, like, any massive dance, you know, sections in this. But just the
way—to be honest with you, like, some of the ways that he moves his hands?
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ I feel like the only time I've ever seen anyone move their hands even close
to that, it was Doug Jones in Hush.
Jenny:​ Uh-huh, yep, yep.
Kristin:​ You know? Just like, the fluidity and just, like, the way that, like, his entire
body seems to be moving where—but you can't tell how it's moving. He's just
unbelievable. A brilliant performance.
Jenny:​ I think we also see something that reminds me of a conversation we had
with James Marsters about when he got onto the show. And he would, like, watch
Tony Head and feel like, oh… Tony's, like, barely moving. He's gonna like, put
people to sleep. But then, you know—
Kristin:​ Yeah.


Jenny:​ He realized that acting for television and acting for theater are very
different.
Kristin:​ Mmm.
Jenny:​ But I think what's really cool about Hinton's performance is that,
he—because of his theater background—he has this sort of, like, overblown,
extreme, exaggerated way of moving. And that, like, kind of amplifies the sort of,
like, magic of the Sweet performance, I think.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ He's—you know. He is, like, pure… theater.
Kristin:​ Yeah. Yeah. It's just—it's fantastic. I also wanna talk about this line in
Sweet's song…
[Clip from episode plays]
Sweet:​ [singing] All those hearts, they open, that must sting
Plus some customers just start combusting
That's the penalty when life is but a song
Kristin:​ "That's the penalty when life is but a song." And I think that it's such a
resonant line for a lot of reasons. Like, obviously in the show, this is the whole
musical's point, is that, you know, musicals are often written to, like, just not look
at the conflict! Look at the rosy, look at the cheery, look at the happy. Don't look at
the bad. Like, let's be happy. And obviously, this musical is not doing that at all.
And I think—I just, like, am rooting a bit to a lot of the conversations that we've
been having, as people with privilege, of like, how easy is it for you in particular to
look away from, like, what you don't wanna see?
Jenny:​ Mmm.
Kristin:​ Right?
Jenny:​ Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin:​ What you don't wanna see, you can look away from, and because—you can
look away from it. And like, what is the—what are the repercussions of that? And I
just think there's a lot in that line that can be applied, like, in many, many places.


But I think probably where we are, like, politically and societally right now, it really
hit me in that way.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ So anyway. That's—yeah, just some deep thoughts.
Jenny:​ And then, in a chorus of song, Dawn of course reveals…
Kristin:​ Mm-mm-mm!
Jenny:​ That her sister is the Slayer and Sweet's like, "get her here!"
Kristin:​ [laughs] Every good demon wants to be the one—the one to kill the
Slayer.
Jenny:​ Uh-huh, yep, yep, yep.
Kristin:​ He wants to watch the Slayer burn. And we cut to the fucking training
room, so you know, everybody just turn off the podcast, go cry in a corner. Et
cetera, et cetera. Whew!
Jenny:​ Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
Kristin:​ They're training. A couple of good jokes up at the top to make you think
perhaps you won't be crying soon. One is that Buffy's like, "Just glad we're not in a
training montage from the 80s," which, please give it to me. Please give it—give me
Giles in a fucking headband and some fucking wristbands and a sweatsuit.
Jenny:​ Mmm.
Kristin:​ You know what I mean? Like, I want it. I want it.
Jenny:​ Mmm!
Kristin:​ I want to see it. Also—
Jenny:​ We get… a version. [both laugh]
Kristin:​ Also, Buffy on the fucking pommel horse, being like, "I am pretty spry for
a corpse." Great line. [Jenny laughs] But then.


Jenny:​ But then a training montage begins! [Kristin giggles] Buffy is suspended in
slow motion while Giles sings a song in which, uh, he posits that his charge, Buffy,
who is like a daughter to him, who has lost her mother, who is but, you know,
twenty or twenty-one—who has no fucking support. Her father has fucked off. And
she has very little support and an unfathomable burden of responsibility. And Giles
sings a little song… about how the best thing he could possibly do so she could just
grow up is leave her? And to that, I say…
["Accidental Parental" starts playing]
Jenny:​ [singing] My dude, be reasonable
It’s true, your slayer’s seasons are few
But it don’t mean that you should run
Good sir, I really think you should stay
With her, she needs support and to slay
You didn’t mean to be a dad
But you are now so how ‘bout that
You think that your presence is holding her back
You should know your absence would be twice as bad
Nobody said you should right all the wrongs
But she sure deserves someone she can lean on
Oh Giles, you’ve been here through thin and thick
So why would you choose right now to split?
You didn’t mean to be a dad
But you are now so act like it
You think that your presence is holding her back
You should know your absence would be twice as bad
Nobody’s saying you should fix it all
But you know to be there to answer her call
[song ends]
Kristin:​ [sighs] Oof. Yeah. You have a good point there, Jenny.
Jenny:​ You know what I mean?
Kristin:​ No, I know. I do know what you mean.
Jenny:​ Thank you.


Kristin:​ I do.
Jenny:​ Ridiculous.
Kristin:​ I agree, I'm very upset with Giles for a lot of things in this episode. And
this is—[laughs] a big one. I will say, though—you know. I mean, gosh, if you're a
listener of this podcast, you know that we love Giles so dearly. I mean, I just—I
just love him so much. And so I also am wrecked by this song that he sings. As
much as I'm so frustrated—and it's funny 'cause, like, Tony Head was talking about
this song. And he actually—[laughs] he even—he was just talking about the song
and he said, "whether Giles was wrong or right." It's like, even he knew that, like,
this was not cool. You know? [Jenny laughs] Like, this is not what he was supposed
to do. And—but if you take yourself out of that place, of like, what the fuck, Giles?
You are left with the reality that this—this man loves Buffy probably more than
anyone on this show at this point. And he doesn't know how to help her. There's a
line where he literally says, "Wish I could lay your arms down and let you rest at
last." It is heart wrenchingly beautiful. Tony Head does a fucking stunning
performance of this, and it breaks my heart.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ And it's just like, he's not right. He's not right. I mean, I think we all can
agree that he's not right. I think that maybe Giles is probably one of the only
reasons that she is standing at all. You know, like…
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ Maybe she's not walking forward yet, but I mean, guys! She just—she's
been through, like, endless trauma. This is not… [sighs] the time to go. But Giles
thinks that it is. And while this song is happening, there's a very brief moment
where we get Tara coming inside the Magic Box as well. Obviously, they're in the
training room in the back, she's in the front. And we see her look up the flower in
this text and she finds it. It's a flower called Lethe's Bramble, that makes you
forget. Which of course, we knew, but she did not.
Jenny:​ [groans]
Kristin:​ She's crying. And she—you hear—like, fuck everybody for these chords of
Under Your Spell again. You know, just like, just breaking us all. And she says,
"There'll be nothing left of me" and then probably the line that breaks me the most
from Tara is when she says, "You made me believe." Like, just—I can't—I have,


like, full-body chills and might start sobbing. Um, right now. But instead, I'm gonna
take these tears and I'm gonna say something, if you don't mind, to Tara.
Jenny:​ Please.
["On Leaving" starts playing]
Kristin:​ [singing] Tara, you should really go
You had a right to know
Even though it hurts, let go
You had a right to know
Ooooh, ooooh
Kristin:​ [sighs] This is just… fucking awful.
Jenny:​ It is awful. We all know what happened to Tara's brain last season.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ Willow knows better than any of us!
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ Because she was the closest person to Tara. And—and, you know—you've
got to imagine, as disturbing as it would be for anybody to discover their memory
had been altered by their partner!
Kristin:​ Mmhmm.
Jenny:​ Like, it's, you know, exponentially increased in the level of disturbance—
Kristin:​ Oh, it's—
Jenny:​ When you consider that Tara, you know, was already in such a horrific
situation.
Kristin:​ Yeah. Yeah, I mean, this would be completely fucked, no matter which way
you looked at it. And you know, the issues around consent are many. And if—and
as you know, if you have watched past this point, there's something that we will
talk about more with this specific… flower, bramble, in mind. But it is—it is just
very, very, very, very fucked up. And while Giles is wrong about needing to leave,
Tara could not be more correct. I mean, there is no way that she could stay with a


partner who betrayed her trust. And not only betrayed her trust but also, like,
completely transgressed boundaries that should never be—
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Never be walked past, never be walked through.
Jenny:​ And is showing signs, increasingly, that like—
Kristin:​ Mmhmm.
Jenny:​ She wouldn't be able to take that information in—
Kristin:​ Yes. Yes.
Jenny:​ Like, she can't consider that. Like, she's just sort of operating from a, "I do
what I want."
Kristin:​ Mmhmm.
Jenny:​ "And there's no more to say about it" kind of place.
Kristin:​ Yeah, like, "I'll always fix it." Right? Like, "I'll just fix it again. I'll just fix
it." Like—
Jenny:​ Right. With another spell!
Kristin:​ Exactly. If somebody has gotten to the point where, like, they can
alter—non-consensually alter their partner's mind. Like, I mean, it's—it would be
fucked up to non-consensually alter anyone's mind. But this is the person that
Willow loves the most. So to be at that point—right, it's like the point of—like,
there's nothing Tara can do at this point, except for leave.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ There's not going to be a conversation that she could ever have with
Willow. How could she trust that Willow isn't just gonna—
Jenny:​ Oh my god.
Kristin:​ Do another spell? Like, you know, you just—yeah. So, as though things
couldn't get worse, Jenny. Willow and Buffy are, like, standing up on the step by


the table in the Magic Box. And fucking Giles comes out from the fucking training
room.
Jenny:​ [groans]
Kristin:​ And Tara and Giles, probably the two strongest vocalists in this episode,
apart from Hinton Battle, do this gutting reprise. Re—somebody called it a redux. I
don't know what that means, but it's probably right.
Jenny:​ It's very sad.
[Clip from episode plays]
Tara:​ [singing] Willow, don't you see
There'll be nothing left of me
You made me believe
Giles:​ [singing] Believe me, I don't want to go
Tara and Giles:​ [singing] And it'll grieve me 'cause I love you so
But we both know…
Kristin:​ The harmonies between Amber Benson and Anthony Stewart Head are so
beautiful. And they're both singing about how they have to leave. And the last line
of this song is just them both saying that they wish they could stay. And it's really
sad, okay!
Jenny:​ Noo.
Kristin:​ It's, like, a lot. It's a lot to fucking handle. Oh, dear god. The only thing
that will save us from having to wade through sadness and betrayal is that Spike is
here. Ding-dong. Gotta—got one of the three ventriloquist dummies here.
Jenny:​ Ha!
Kristin:​ The music swells and Spike says to the ventriloquist dummy, "Sing, man."
And the ventriloquist dummy [music from episode swells] opens his mouth and this
comes out—
[Clip from episode plays]


Dummy:​ [robotically] My master has the Slayer's sister hostage at the
Bronze because she summoned him and at midnight, he's going to take her
to the underworld to be his queen.
Jenny:​ My favorite thing about this is that you can see the actor's mouth [Kristin
laughs] inside of the dummy mask mouth. Buffy has her little "Dawn's in trouble,
must be Tuesday" moment.
Kristin:​ Oh, and this show aired on a Tuesday, just in case you didn't know that.
Jenny:​ Oh my god.
Kristin:​ So it's extra special—extra specially funny.
Jenny:​ And you know, the group is coming together, talking about what to do. And
Giles is like, "Buffy's gonna do it by herself." And Anya's like, "Oh no, I've seen
some of these underworld child bride deals. [Kristin laughs] And they never end
well. Well, maybe once." [both laugh] Like, uh…
Kristin:​ Uh…
Jenny:​ Uh…!
Kristin:​ Yeah, mmm, no, don't think so. Yeah.
Jenny:​ Uh, Giles, sucking, sucking, sucking. Then, oh wow! It is revealed.
Kristin:​ Oh my god.
Jenny:​ Buffy blows up Spike's spot. [Kristin laughs] And acknowledges in front of
the Scoobies that he sang… a song to her. And Xander says, "Spike sang a wittle
song?"
Kristin:​ [laughs] Fucking Xander. Like, always. Just like, any chance he has to
fucking twist that knife in old Spike, he does. Anya—Anya—Xander and Anya are
both true to form, with Xander twisting the knife and Anya being like, "So would
you say it was a breakaway hit or…?" [laughs]
Jenny:​ [laughs] "Breakaway pop hit or more of a book number?"
Kristin:​ [laughing] She wants to know! Who's getting the hit?!


Jenny:​ Anya! Relax! [both laugh]
Kristin:​ And Giles—I mean. Listen. We know where we're going, right? Giles is
like—
Jenny:​ Ugh.
Kristin:​ "Actually, we're not going to help Buffy this time, everybody. We're gonna
fucking… stay here. Buffy's going alone." And you know, to give a little credit—I will
immediately take this credit away—but like, to give a little credit to everyone else,
Willow, Xander, Anya, Spike, they all are like, "But what about—but, also—but,
what? But hmm?" [Jenny laughs] Like, they were all ready to throw down, of
course, because that's what they do.
Jenny:​ Yeah!
Kristin:​ And even Buffy is like, "What do you expect me to do?" to Giles. And
Giles… he says, "Your best."
[music starts playing]
Jenny and Kristin:​ Your best?!
Kristin:​ Your fucking best?! That—that is what—
Jenny:​ Your best?!
Kristin:​ Whew-hoo-hoo-ooh!
["What in the Actual" plays]
Jenny:​ [singing] What in the actual fuck are you doing?
Right now you kinda suck
You’re bailing when you should have her back
Kristin:​ [singing] You’re really screwing it up
You’re losing the mission
Supposed to be the grown up
But you’re leaving her open to attack
Jenny and Kristin:​ [singing] It’s not helpful when you bring somebody back
from the grave


To say they gotta grow up so you’re going away
Post-resurrection testing them while they fade away
Even slayers need a little help when they save the day, save the day
Save the day
Kristin: ​[singing] What in the actual fuck?
Jenny: ​[singing] Are you thinking?
Jenny and Kristin:​ [singing] We are not sorry but
Jenny:​ [singing] We have to disrupt this dumb bullshit
Jenny and Kristin:​ [singing] Bad choices runnin’ amok
Jenny:​ [singing] We hate what you’re doing
Jenny and Kristin:​ [singing] Freakin’ morally bankrupt
Kristin:​ [singing] And all of ya Scoobies are complicit in it
Jenny and Kristin:​ [singing] It’s not helpful when you bring somebody back
from the grave
To say they gotta grow up so you’re going away
Post-resurrection testing them while they fade away
Even slayers need a little help to get through the day
To get through the day
Jenny:​ [singing] Even slayers need a little help when they save the day…
Kristin:​ I hope that Giles—I hope Giles has his fucking discman out and I hope he
puts that—I hope he burns that track a few times onto a CD.
Jenny:​ Wow.
Kristin:​ And I hope he plays it for himself a few times, 'cause sir, you have a lot to
think upon.
Jenny:​ Wow, remember burning a CD of just one song over and over and over
again?
Kristin:​ [laughs] Yes.


Jenny:​ Ten times in a row. Great. Love it.
Kristin:​ Buffy's doing it, though. She's like—I mean, this would probably be my
response as well. Like, I would be like, are you fucking kidding me? Fine! [laughs]
Jenny:​ Ha!
Kristin:​ Slam! So she has—[both laugh] slammed the door and she is walking. And
Buffy has been telling us that she is not feeling her feelings the way she is used to
feeling them—
Jenny:​ Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin:​ Since the beginning of this—season, really, but like, definitely since the
start of this musical. And this—
Jenny:​ Oh, yeah.
Kristin:​ This song is more of that. She's saying, "I touch the fire, it freezes me.
Why can't I feel? I want the fire back."
Jenny:​ Okay, no offense though, but she does not touch the fire. [Kristin laughs]
She never touches the fire. [laughs]
Kristin:​ Wow.
Jenny:​ And she's like, "My skin should crack and peel." And it's like, Buffy?
Kristin:​ Point—[laughs]
Jenny:​ You are—let me explain. [both laugh]
Kristin:​ Point, counterpoint. [laughs] I think she's being—I don't know if you've
heard of this, Jenny, in your career—
Jenny:​ No.
Kristin:​ As a songwriter. But I think she might be making a metaphor.
Jenny:​ Hmm.


Kristin:​ You know, just—so, drawing comparison between things. But yes, [laughs]
to your point, she does not actually put her hand in the flame.
Jenny:​ Alright, so she's singing her little verse about being numb. Then she sings,
"Through the smoke, she calls to me." We cut to the Bronze, there's Dawn and
Sweet. And a digital smoke effect.
Kristin:​ I love it. You don't like it? I love it. [Jenny cackles] Oh, wow. But I actually
really like the, um, wobbly, like, gasoline effect of—that they use in the Bronze. But
to each their own. [Jenny laughs] Something that I think we can both agree to love,
Jenny, is the fucking leather coat number two that Buffy—
Jenny:​ The shoulders! Oh my god.
Kristin:​ Oh! My god! Give me this coat! Give it to me.
Jenny:​ Here is something to sing about! The—
Kristin:​ That is something—you're right!
Jenny:​ Coat.
Kristin:​ We should point that out to her. She does have something to sing about.
Jenny:​ Hmm.
Kristin:​ [laughs] We'll get there. We're not even in that song yet, but she does. It's
those shoulders. Spike has an incredible cigarette flick. I said it once and I'll say it
again, I will—I just would really like for my life to include one moment where I can
flick a cigarette angrily like that. It's just real cool. [Jenny laughs] His line is so
great. "I'm free if that bitch dies. I better help her out." [both laugh] Summing up.
Sweet is in there, saying, "She's drawn to the fire." Giles, wondering if he is leaving
Dawn in danger. Sir, indeed—
Jenny:​ [yelling] Yes, you idiot!
Kristin:​ You—you are.
Jenny:​ Of course you are!
Kristin:​ I could answer this question for you. The Scoobies decide, like, a minute
after they're not going to go. So now they're all on their way.


Jenny:​ Oh my god.
Kristin:​ But Buffy doesn't know that yet. Tara, I think… [laughs] Tara has the
truest 2020-hyphen-2021 line of the musical when she sings, "Everything is turning
out so dark." [both laugh] Yikes, Tara! A little real. A little real for me, there.
Jenny:​ True. We get—we get Willow's excellent Alyson Hannigan nod. Alyson
Hannigan, who so desperately did not want to sing, gets, "I think this line's mostly
filler."
Kristin:​ It's really good. And you know, I mean, this song—like, we love to laugh.
There's a lot to laugh about. [laughs] Less and less as we're getting to the end of
this musical, but…
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ This song is really—it's really pivotal. This whole episode is pivotal and I'm
sure we've talked about it already. But like, they talk about how they are now at
the point of no return. They have seen all of the things that they were trying—well.
Not quite. They're almost to the point of seeing all the things that they had not
seen. And they can't turn their back on it anymore. They can't pretend like these
things aren't real and aren't part of their day to day, aren't part of their reality.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ This shit is fucking real. And they are at the point of no return. And so, you
know, we're not into the rest of the season yet, but I would imagine that probably,
some of Season 6 will be what the fuck they do now that they are at this point of no
return. So. Anyway. Right before—before we get to the Bronze where Buffy enters,
I just wanna say that Spike apparently gets lost in an alleyway. I don't understand
why. He, like— [laughs]
Jenny:​ He vaults himself into… an alley that is fenced off. There don't appear to be
doors in it. And then he, like, whips around and like, looks like, "Oh. I can't believe
I've done this."
Kristin:​ [laughs] Yeah. It's just weird. So anyway. Buffy enters.
[Clip from episode plays]
[crashing noise]


Sweet:​ Showtime! [chuckles]
Jenny:​ Oh, boy. "I love a good entrance." "How are you with death scenes?"
Kristin:​ She's still got her wordplay.
Jenny:​ Buffy makes her little deal. She's gonna fight Sweet and if she loses, she'll
go to the underworld with him. But if she kills him, then Dawn goes free.
Kristin:​ Ugh!
Jenny:​ And then he's like, "What if I kill you?" and she says, "Trust me. Won't
help." Buffy!
Kristin:​ And maybe in one of Hinton Battle's, like, best line deliveries of the
episode, [laughs] he goes, "That's gloomy." [both laugh] I love—like, and we'll get
more into this when we talk about the next song. But like, I love the way that
Sweet—really, the way the actor, Hinton Battle—looks at Sarah Michelle Gellar.
[laughs] Like, the way that Sweet, like, takes in Buffy, you know? It's just, like,
very apparent—
Jenny:​ Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin:​ That, like, he—he was here to make some people burn up, to like,
whatever. And now he's like, really witnessing that this is a whole big fucking
shitshow. He's like, well, fuck! You know? Like, I feel like his whole way of intaking
this and what's about to happen is just, like—he's really quite stunned by it. And
I—I don't know if that came from Joss, I don't know if that came from Hinton. But I
just think it's a really cool dynamic between the two of them.
Jenny:​ Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Buffy starts to sing a little song called Something to Sing
About, and it's about how she's very depressed.
Kristin:​ [sadly] Mm!
[Clip from episode plays]
Buffy:​ [singing] Life's a show and we all play our parts
And when the music starts, we open up our hearts


Kristin:​ Again, pulling on this musical concept of, like, a musical is supposed to
hide—like, not hide, but like, turn away from the bad and give us songs about the
good. It's kind of like Instagram. [laughs] You know? [Jenny laughs] Just
showin'—showin' us the best of everything and everybody's looking at other
people's Instagrams like, "man, I wish I had it together." But they don't know that
after that photo was taken, that like, I cried in the shower for two hours. You know?
Like, that—
Jenny:​ Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin:​ That the… what she's saying is like—no, what she's saying is literally,
"Life's a show and we're playing parts."
Jenny:​ If you want to fear for your life and the lives of those you love, check out
Buffy's terrifying eyes as she sings the line, "To be like other girls." [Kristin laughs]
It is… very scary. [laughs] I run for the hills.
Kristin:​ She breaks—she actually breaks the fourth wall here with us and says,
"We'll sing a happy song." She looks directly into our souls and says, "And you can
sing along." And we're like, goddamnit! I just signed up for a vampire show, what
the fuck is happening?! [laughs]
Jenny:​ Yeah. Yeah.
Kristin:​ I think maybe my favorite line in this first piece of this song is, "Don't give
me songs. Give me something to sing about." And I know, like, obviously the
depression is there. It's, like, the driving force of this song. But I also think that,
like, there's something so fucking powerful about that! Especially right now. Like,
don't paint over the reality of our existence. Don't paint over the reality of other
people's existences and lived experiences. Don't paint over—don't gloss it over. I
don't want the song. I want something to actually sing about. Like, I want to fix—I
want to fix the things. I want to help the things, I want to make the things better
and then I'll have something to sing about. And in Buffy's case, she is—
Jenny:​ Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin:​ You know, very specifically talking about her—her mental health and all
that she's lost and all the grief that she is still trying to figure out how to walk
through. And… ugh, god! Without getting, like, too deep into it, I just feel… you
know, this episode aired just a couple months after September 11th. Which was a
very particular time in public consciousness, you know? And like, everybody was
going through something.


Jenny:​ Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin:​ And that time can't really be compared to this time that we're in, at the
start of 2021. Except in the fact that it is a large societal moment, where a lot of us
are just, like, not okay. You know? A lot of us are not doing so hot. It is a very,
very heavy and hard time, and a time that I think we've been, like, pulling on
communities in ways that we maybe have not before. And so this song always hits,
but it… hits particularly right now.
You know, if you are listening to this podcast for the first time—many of you are
not. And you're like, first time? Who are ​those​ people? But if you are one of those
people and you're listening to us for the first time because you found us through
this musical episode, you should know that every episode of this podcast always
does come with one song. And Jenny, that song is sung usually by you and it's
written from the perspective of Buffy. So when we got to this place in the
musicals—the musical of Once More, With Feeling and our podcast musical—we
knew there needed to be, like, this place of communion between universes. So that
we could write a song in the "I," and that "I" could be both Buffy's "I" and Jenny
and my "I," and also, like, you as the listener. Like, the "I" is meant here to be all
of us.
["Once More, With Feeling" starts playing]
Jenny:​ [singing] Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I’m just tryna get some light back
Scared that it’s forever gone
Maybe we can find it in the feedback
Somewhere there’s a hidden song
I go the only way I’ve ever known
A step, and then, again, another one
I’m just tryna get some light back
Scared that it’s forever gone
Maybe we can find it in the feedback
Somewhere there’s a hidden song
I fight the only way I’ve ever done
A step, and then, again, another one


I’m just tryna get some light back
Scared that it’s forever gone
Maybe we can find it in the feedback
Somewhere there’s a hidden song
Kristin:​ Well. You know what they say about music. It'll kill ya. [both laugh] So. I
hate to break it to everyone, but we didn't even finish talking about what happens
in this song, in this scene. Because this song is kind of in a couple of parts, right?
There's the, like, "give me something to sing about" part. There's two segments in
that, with the, like, rock-y part where she's dancing and the sing-y part where she's
singing. [laughs] You can tell that I'm the musician between the two of us, right?
Jenny:​ Oh, that's really good.
Kristin:​ Thank you. But… she goes up on stage. And she's standing by Sweet. And
that's when he really gives her this look. And it's sort of like… if he's inspiring them
to sing and to reveal their truths, it's almost like he sees it before he makes her
sing it. You know what I mean? Like, he—like, that's why he's like, oh, fuck! You
know? And…
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ She says, "There was… [sighs] no pain, no fear, no doubt…"
[Clip from episode plays]
Buffy:​ [singing] There was no pain
No fear, no doubt, till they pulled me out
Of heaven
So that's my refrain
I live in hell, 'cause I've been expelled
From heaven
I think I was in heaven
Jenny:​ [groans]
Kristin:​ A light lyric. Just a bop. Jenny, the chord progression in this is very
specific. That, like, very much—sometimes when I say to you, "Can you make the
song so that it makes me sad?" Like, [laughs] this does that. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Mm! Mmhmm, mmhmm. Sad chords.


Kristin:​ Sad—​very​ sad. It's like, there's sad chords and then there's whatever the
fuck this is. And it's devastating. And to make… [Jenny laughs sadly] sad matters
even sadder, we have the response, the reaction shots, of Giles, of Xander. Of Tara
and worst of all, Willow, who is just—I mean, I don't know that I've ever seen
Willow's face move me as much as this. She is destroyed. I mean, of course she is.
Of course she is. She's completely destroyed and she's crying and Tara is
comforting Willow, which is also very hard, you know? It's just like this complicated
thing of you love somebody and they've totally fucked you over. They've fucked you
up, but you can't help it. They're hurting and you must—like, it's just—it's—there's
so much happening in this moment, that it's just—it's overwhelming. And it's
beautifully done. And I would be crying if I didn't have a responsibility to keep
talking to you on a microphone.
Jenny:​ [laughs] Yeah, this is, um… it's all pretty brutal. And, uh… the only
acceptable course of action in the face of all this devastation is [robotic voice]
initiate combust-o dance sequence!
Kristin:​ [laughs] Sarah Michelle fucking Gellar. They had a—like, a dance double.
You know, like a stunt double but a dance double for her. They barely fucking used
the dance double. She is doing nearly every single thing that you see in these
dance sequences. I mean, just a performance—like, truly, she's just—Emmy for
Sarah forever. And maybe a Tony, at this point.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm. Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ So, um…
Jenny:​ Mmhmm.
Kristin:​ But yeah, she jumps on stage.
Jenny:​ EGOT for Sarah.
Kristin:​ [laughs] She's dancing, she's dancing. The smoke is happening. And then
what happens, Jenny?
Jenny:​ [takes deep breath] [sings] Spike stops her! Spike grabs her and makes her
stop dancing! And he's all like, "Life is living!"
[Clip from episode plays]
Spike:​ [singing] Life's not a song


Life isn't bliss, life is just this
It's living
Kristin:​ "The pain that you feel, you can only heal by living." And every time he
says "living," he's singing it in the same fucking horrible, horrible chord progression
that she sang to use the—to sing the word "heaven!"
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ I gotta go! It is…
Jenny:​ Yeah, yeah.
Kristin:​ Oh my god. I mean, truly. Like, "life's not a song, life is just this, it's living.
You have to go on living. So one of us is living."
Jenny:​ Do you think there is something they could have done—there was a
different way they could have executed this—this callback?
Kristin:​ Yeah, yeah, I actually—
Jenny:​ "The hardest thing in this world is to live in it." Clank!
Kristin:​ I hate—I'm sorry if this is a thing that you like. But I actually—one of the
only things I dislike in this episode is Dawn saying this line again. I just feel like we
got the point. Like, I don't think we needed a line drawn in that moment. And I
think that, like, what Spike sang was so poignant that it is a bit undercut by this
line from Dawn where she says—where she, you know—
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Says the same—she says the same thing Buffy said to her at the end of
Season 5. And… ehh, but I didn't need it, I didn't need it. I don't want it. Give me
the cut with this taken out and I think that it will be a bit more powerful. But… a
number. A number. I think maybe one of the saddest songs I have ever, ever seen
in a musical. I have cried almost every time I watched it, in preparation for this
conversation. [laughs] So.
Jenny:​ Yep, yep, yep.
Kristin:​ Even Sweet is impressed. He is clapping, he is clapping. Willow—


Jenny:​ He's like, "What a show-stopping number!"
Kristin:​ Yeah. Willow is very much angry witch Willow. "Get out of here," she says
through her tears, in a fit of rage. And since Sweet—like, everyone else at this point
is like, "I smell power." Like, every—every—every kind of demon across the globe is
like, hmm. [laughs] I'm just sensing—hmm. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Getting a big whiff of power over here!
Kristin:​ [laughs] And then—you know, then there's this, like—I mean, who cares,
it's fine. But like, the twist on the end of this is a little weak, where like, Dawn is
like, "I didn't summon—" Like, Sweet's like, "She summoned me." Dawn's like, "I
didn't." And they're like, well then, who? And Xander raises his hand and is like, "It
was me." And I like the idea of Xander saying, "I just wanted to make sure we'd
work out, that we'd get a happy ending." Like, I think that's really fitting with his
character and it works.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm, mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin:​ But I don't think that he would have ever taken it this far. He would have
definitely told them what the fuck was up, like, at the beginning of the musical.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ So it's a little wiggly for me. But, um… anyway. It gives us a "ha-ha-ha!"
moment when Xander's like…
[Clip from episode plays]
Xander:​ Does this mean that I have to… be your queen?
Sweet:​ It's tempting. But I think we'll waive that clause just this once.
Jenny:​ [groans]
Kristin:​ Not our favorite. Not our favorite. Listen, Sweet doesn't have to take
Xander down to the hell dimension. But we don't love when the joke is Xander
being his queen. It's not a funny joke. As a matter of fact, Jenny, I don't know if
you are aware of a structure, a societal structure—
Jenny:​ Hmm.


Kristin:​ That exists that helps—
Jenny:​ Hmm.
Kristin:​ To really hold up things like homophobia.
Jenny:​ Hmmm… I'm trying to think of one. Oh yeah!
[Patriarchy Reimagined plays]
Ba-bum-bum!
The patriarchy! (The patriarchy!)
Thunder clap!
Scary laugh!
Kristin:​ Yes, that is. That is cor—that is the correct answer.
Jenny:​ [clears throat]
Kristin:​ Though boy, did it sound different than it typically does. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Yeah, weird. Weird!
Kristin:​ Cool.
Jenny:​ Also, like, just imagine being this demon and like, usually you, like, roll up
on a town and you do your little musical spell. And then you, like, take a child bride
back to the underworld, whatever. [Kristin laughs] But you roll up on Sunnydale.
And you get in the middle of all this. [Kristin laughs] This witch is erasing her
girlfriend's memory and this Slayer was resurrected and—
Kristin:​ [laughing] He—
Jenny:​ She was pulled out of heaven by her friends. And this goofball and this
former vengeance demon are having, like, premarital cold feet. And you know
what, you guys? [Kristin laughs] I'm actually just gonna go?
Kristin:​ [laughing] Yes—
Jenny:​ You have a lot going on here and, like, you probably don't need anything
else getting added to the equation. So I'm just gonna—I'm gonna—okay.


Kristin:​ Jenny, I think in a previous conversation, you compared this to the murder
hornets showing up on the scene in 2020. And, like, seeing like, okay, you know
what?
Jenny:​ They're like—yeah. The murder hornets were like, [buzzing noise] [Kristin
laughs] And they, like, roll into the middle of town and they're like, oh,
pan-pandemic?
Kristin:​ Oh. Hmm.
Jenny:​ Oh, uh, uh—ooh.
Kristin:​ Political uprising? Hm, huh.
Jenny:​ Oh, ahh, whew! Actually, whew, look at the time. [Kristin laughs] We
actually have a thing back at the hive, so we'll come back next year or possibly
never. Uh, bye!
Kristin:​ Gotta go! Yes. And that is Sweet's very, very brilliant choice. Sweet, good
choice, good choice. And he says—
Jenny:​ You stay away from these messy people, sir!
Kristin:​ Oh my god, what a fucking mess. He's like—and he gives us our titular line
here. He says, "All these secrets you've been concealing, say you're happy now,
once more, with feeling." What a fucking—this is the 2020-2021 musical of
musicals, isn't it now?
Jenny:​ Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin:​ Try me again.
Jenny:​ I—
Kristin:​ So now try me again with that happy—you're happy? Mmm, try it one
more time.
Jenny:​ Mmm.
Kristin:​ You wanna try that again? Okay.


Jenny:​ I will say, I am a person who can do without the title of a thing being
nested inside of the thing. Like, ta-da! [laughs]
Kristin:​ I can usually, but I like it here. I like it here. It's a musical—
Jenny:​ Yeah, I guess tonally, it makes sense.
Kristin:​ It calls for it, you know? I think it calls for it. And fucking Sweet just poofs
off back to the underworld. And he has this amazing exit.
[Clip from episode plays]
Sweet: ​[singing] Now I gotta run
See you all in… hell! Ha!
[Jenny laughs]
Kristin:​ And then, in what we can only guess is a little, like, leftover magic—a little
residue. A little residual magic dust, the Scoobies have one more song to sing.
Don't they, Jenny?
Jenny:​ The mind reels at why these people A. are still singing. And B… there's still
a freaking band go—like—
Kristin:​ Listen, it's—
Jenny:​ Residual magic, you would think would kind of wane. [Kristin laughs] Like,
oh, maybe there's just, like, one guitar or something—
Kristin:​ A couple notes? [laughs]
Jenny:​ But no, there's still a band. Still a band!
Kristin:​ Dawn's little voice is so sweet at the start of this song, though.
[Clip from episode plays]
Dawn:​ [singing] Where do we go from here?
Kristin:​ They're lost because they are essentially now living with all of the facts.
Like, they cannot hide anymore and they're, like—literally, the title of this song


could have been "So Now the Fuck What?" Like—[both laugh] what the—what the
fuck do we—
Jenny:​ And maybe next time, it will be.
Kristin:​ [laughs] They have this very, very fleeting moment where they all hold
hands. And then they sort of violently un-hold hands and talk about walking alone
in fear. I think—not that you need to know my favorite lyric of every song, but! I
really do love when they sing, "Why is the path unclear when we know home is
near?" It just is, like, really beautiful to me, to think about the fact that, like—
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ They are—they are in a recognizable place. And they now are even in a
more recognizable place, because the spell is wearing off. So now, it's almost worse
because they know where they are and they have to face all of this and they can't
figure out where they are. Like, it's scarier when you know you're supposed to
know where you are and you don't.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Which is where they all are and, um… yeah, I mean. One of the last lines
of this—I can't believe—I truly can't believe that we're coming to the end of this
episode. I'm gonna get choked up, but… one of the last lines that we hear from
them before we move forward is, "When does the end appear? When do the
trumpets cheer? The curtains close on a kiss." And so I think it's just important to
note that what they're longing for in there—
Jenny:​ Hmmm.
Kristin:​ Is their classical musical ending.
Jenny:​ Mmhmm, mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin:​ But yeah. I mean, god, if I talk about that then I have to talk—then I have
to stop talking. And it makes me sad, Jenny. We've been journeying to this moment
for years.
Jenny:​ Yeah. Well! You know what's a way to stop talking without stopping talking?
Kristin:​ Hmm?


["The End of the Episode" starts playing]

Jenny and Kristin:​ [singing] And so…
It’s the end, it’s the end of the episode
Guess we’ll figure out together where we’ll go

Kristin:​ [singing] Erotic novellas await, but for now
Jenny:​ [singing] It’s the end, it’s the end of the episode

It’s the end, it’s the end of the episode
Jenny:​ [singing] If you’ll excuse me, I have something in my eye…
[song ends]
Jenny:​ Yes. Well. You know. All good things sometimes must come to an end, but
then most good things [Kristin sighs] sometimes come back again for the next
episode.
Kristin:​ That's true. And technically, there is one more thing that happens, before
the end—


Jenny:​ You are not wrong.
Kristin:​ Of the episode.
Jenny:​ Buckle your fucking safety belt!
Kristin:​ Yeah, buckle 'em, buckle 'em tight. Buckle 'em hard. [laughs] Sorry. Didn't
mean—
Jenny:​ Sharpen your pencils. [Kristin laughs] Fire up that fanfic.
Kristin:​ Hey, um, so Buffy and Spike are outside. And she's like, "I touched the
fire" and he's like, "I died," and we're like, oh god, we've heard these songs before!
Oh, no!
Jenny:​ [stammers in panic]
Kristin:​ [laughs] She says, "This isn't real, but I just wanna feel" as he says, "You
can make me feel."
Jenny:​ [rolls tongue]
Kristin:​ And then the music swells and, um, um, um… [music starts] oh god! It's
happening! The guitar is playing, Jenny! But before… before. Before whatever is
going to happen, happens. I think we need to do something unprecedented.
Jenny:​ An envelope has materialized in my hands! [Kristin laughs] A sealed
envelope that clearly says, "Sexual Tension Awards." I'm slitting the seal. [sounds
of paper tearing] I'm taking the paper out. [sounds of paper being tapped] [music
stops] [clears throat] And the notice reads: you fools. [Kristin laughs] There is no
vote. There can be no vote. There can be no truth but the one true answer. [music
starts] This episode's Sexual Tension Award goes to Buffy and Spike. Signed, the
management.
Kristin:​ Fuck yeah.
Jenny:​ Hell yeah.
["Codawoooooooo" starts playing]
