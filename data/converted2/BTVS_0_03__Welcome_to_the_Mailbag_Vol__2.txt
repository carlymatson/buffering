Buffering the Vampire Slayer
Episode 0.03: Welcome to the Mailbag Vol. 2
Jenny:​ Hey everybody! Before we get started, just want to let you know
about a few exciting developments! [Kristin laughs] First of all, we have our
first-ever live taping of a Buffering the Vampire Slayer episode.
Kristin:​ Ohh, my word.
Jenny:​ We’re gonna be doing it in Los Angeles at the NerdMelt Showroom,
on February 2nd at 7 pm. You can get tickets at NerdMeltLA.com.
Kristin:​ And find out, once and for all, are we actually this great at talking
or are we really good at editing? [laughter]
Jenny:​ Just a little editing humor for ya. Ha-HA!
Kristin:​ Wow. Yeah, so come, join us. It’s gonna be great. Next week, we’ll
probably tell you about some guests that are gonna come.
Jenny:​ Mm-hmm!
Kristin:​ Uh-huh! Also, speaking of shows, to those of you who came out in
New York City in Brooklyn to Union Hall to see our first ever live show– we
didn’t do a live taping, per se. It wasn’t a proper episode, but we did play
through the songs. We had–
Jenny:​ It was a celebration of Season 1!
Kristin:​ A celebration of Season 1. We had some incredible guests come up
and talk to us. We had slayerettes who helped us with our music! And you
can listen to that entire event now, totally free of charge. You go over to,
drumroll please... our new Patreon page.
Jenny:​ Oh, I forgot to give you a drumroll.
Kristin:​ Try it again, Jenny.
Jenny:​ Okay.


Kristin:​ Drumroll, please!
Jenny:​ [makes drumroll sound]
Kristin:​ Our new Patreon page!
Jenny:​ Badum-tch!
Kristin:​ [laughs] We have set up a Patreon page,
patreon.com/bufferingcast. If you don’t know about Patreon, don’t be afraid.
There will be a lot of free content there. It’s a great place for artists and
podcasters and all sorts of human beings to put all of their materials. And
then there is bonus materials for those who donate at the dollar, $5, or $10
mark. You can find out all about that over there, or you can say, “Screw
that, you guys, I just wanna listen to the free episode!” You can go on over,
and you can just click the sound file right there and listen to it.
Jenny:​ Oh yeah!
Kristin:​ And you’ll notice, as you’re listening to the sound file, that there are
some visual cues. For example, I made four videos of slow-motion Cordelia.
Those are accessible– ​all ​of the visual elements are accessible for any
Patreon donor level, a dollar or more.
Jenny:​ Yes!
Kristin:​ So if you want the full 360 experience, you can also get that over at
patreon.com/bufferingcast.
Jenny:​ Yes indeed.
Kristin:​ Speaking of music–
Jenny:​ Holy smokes. Let me tell you something, since last we spoke, our
album, “Buffering the Vampire Slayer: Songs from Season 1,” has become
available on all digital platforms.
Kristin:​ Yeah!


Jenny:​ You can find it on iTunes, you can find it on Spotify, you can find it
all over the digital land.
Kristin:​ Google Play!
Jenny:​ Yeah, Google Play. It’s everywhere. You can locate it, wherever you
please. [Kristin laughs] And we encourage you to do that and we hope you
enjoy it. We also wanna let you know that we have a handful– we did a
second short run of CDs and we have a handful of those left, up on our
website at bufferingthevampireslayer.com. If you click on “Store,” or “Shop.”
And you can order that CD, I think... we have a few left and then there
won’t be anymore.
Kristin:​ Yep! Well said.
Jenny:​ [laughing] Good math, right?
Kristin:​ [laughing] Well said, Jenny. “There are some and then there will be
none.” That is exactly how that will work.
Jenny:​ Unless no one ever orders another one ever again.
Kristin:​ Yeah, they just stop. That’s true. And then we’ll just have some
CDs. Um... cool. Well, shall we get into it?
Jenny:​ Let’s.
[THEME MUSIC]
Jenny:​ Hello and welcome to Buffering the Vampire Slayer, a podcast where
we usually talk about one episode of ​Buffy​ at a time in chronological order.
But that’s not what we’re doing today. [Kristin laughs] I’m Jenny Owen
Youngs.
Kristin:​ And I’m Kristin Russo. And today we’re doing a mailbag episode.
Jenny:​ Hurray!


Kristin:​ So we ended Season 1 a few weeks ago.
Jenny:​ Sure did.
Kristin:​ And... we’ve been waking up every morning thinking, when are
they going to put up another episode of this podcast?
Jenny:​ Mmm.
Kristin:​ And here we are, finally. Answering our own query. But before–
Jenny:​ Righ right right right. I wrote a letter to Santa. It was like, “Dear
Santa, all I want for Christmas is more episodes of Buffering the Vampire
Slayer. Stat.”
Kristin:​ Well, Santa was a little delayed, but.
Jenny:​ He had a lot to take care of. Recently.
Kristin:​ He did. Yes, that’s true. So we’re back and we figured that the best
way at this was– next week, on the 11th, we’ll be back with the very first
episode of Season 2.
Jenny:​ Awooooo-ga.
Kristin:​ You’re not– wow. Good thing you clarified that with a “ga” at the
end, ‘cause I thought you were a wolf howling.
Jenny:​ No, I wasn’t ready to wolf-howl.
Kristin:​ But before we get there, we want to tackle some of the incredible
emails that we’ve gotten over the season. And in addition to talking about
some of the emails we’ve received from all of you, some of you sent us your
very favorite moments from Season 1. So we’re gonna kinda crawl through
all of that wonderful material and talk about it where talking is needed. And
listen where listening is needed. It’s gonna be... just lovely.
Jenny:​ It sounds pretty great.


Kristin:​ I really– I think I did a good job selling it. [laughs]
Jenny:​ I– yeah, I’m totally sold. I was not sold on this episode till right now.
Kristin:​ Perfect.
Jenny:​ Alright, let’s do this.
Kristin:​ Let’s do this. So our very first email is from Paloma. Paloma says,
“Dear Jenny and Kristin, just got off of the Buffering ‘Halloween’ hangout. It
was so cool! Thanks for answering my question and responding to some of
my comments. Along with being a fan of ​Buffy​ since I was a twelve-year-old
lesbian, at age 24, I’m now a large fan of you guys, too. ​Buffy ​was sort of
my intro into the TV geek world. What was ​your​ guys’ intros into whatever
geeky world you are in?” So I figured this would be a good place to start.
Jenny:​ Yes.
Kristin:​ ‘Cause like, how did you become the geek you are, Jenny? What
was your entry point?
Jenny:​ Well, I feel like, um... there was a lot of sci-fi movie viewing
happening in my house. Like, as we’ve discussed privately but not on the
podcast, I was exposed to movies like ​Alien ​and ​Aliens​ at a– probably too
young of an age. [Kristin laughs] But that kinda like, got into me and when I
was in elementary school, I read a lot of comic books. Which I think was
kind of a thing that was passed down from my older brother. I read a lot of
like, ​Spider-Man​ and ​She-Hawk​ and ​X-Men​.​ X-Men​ in particular really has a
lot of meaning for me.
Kristin:​ Do you think that you would have had access to the comics if you
didn’t have an older brother?
Jenny:​ No. Well, I had a lot of like, guy friends who also were into comics.
But I– but it started, you know, at home.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ And also, my brother was really into D&D, so I read a lot of his


Forgotten Realms novels. And was just generally sort of pro-dragon, pro...
monster, pro alien at a young age.
Kristin:​ I did not have any of that. I mean, I had like– I read, like, ​The
Chronicles of Narnia​ as a kid, and was super into that. But I didn’t have
anything around me that intrigued– sort of like, tempted me to enter further
into those worlds. You know, I watched like, ​The NeverEnding Story​. So
there were like, some elements but I didn’t really recognize them as
anything. It just like– cool stories. And then ​way ​later, like, in my 20s, I
watched ​Iron Man​. And I was like, hmm, I really enjoy this. This was a very
enjoyable thing for me, and then from ​Iron Man,​ I was like, oh, I guess I
liked ​Iron Man​, I should watch ​X-Men.​ Maybe I would like that too. And then
it was over. Like, that was it for me.
Jenny:​ [sings triumphant notes]
Kristin:​ ‘Cause it really– I didn’t understand, before watching ​X-Men​, I
didn’t understand why everyone was– like, I didn’t understand geek culture.
I didn’t understand nerd culture. I didn’t understand why people loved
comics so much. I just thought it was like, well, it’s cartoons and like, fun
and whatever. You know? None of the larger underpinning messages and the
importance of those messages was apparent to me at all. And then of
course, ​X-Men​, as it did for you, I guess, also, earlier, just sort of threw
open the doors to like, holy shit. We’re talking about all this stuff right now
in the context of this fantasy, this... other world, allows us to access things
that we couldn’t otherwise. And then I– and then we started dating. And you
were like, “You have to watch ​Buffy the Vampire Slayer.​”
Jenny:​ Oh, yeah.
Kristin:​ And I was like, ugh!
Jenny:​ You’re welcome.
Kristin:​ And now here I am. [laughter] So yeah. Thanks, Paloma! Thanks
for the question.
Jenny:​ Yeah!


Kristin:​ Okay so next is an email from Daniel, who is commenting on,
earlier in the season [Jenny laughs] we discussed... we discussed Giles’ car,
right? You had a few choice words about Giles’ car, Jenny.
Jenny:​ I mean, it’s a shit heap.
Kristin:​ Well. Daniel begs to differ.
Jenny:​ Okay.
Kristin:​ Daniel says: “I listened to the mailbag episode.” That must have
been where you first trashed Giles’ car. “And I did want to chime in on the
lack of love and appreciation for Giles’ lovely Citroen– ” oh– and thank, you
Daniel– gave me the way to pronounce it. Cit-troy-in. “– car. Personally, I
think it’s the perfect vehicle for Giles. It fits him like the funky old Volvo fits
the 1970s detective Columbo, or Lorelai Gilmore’s Jeep suits her, the perfect
vehicular reflection of the person. Giles drives a Model DS, which in French is
pronounced day-ess.” Thank you again, Daniel. “The same as ‘Déesse,’
which means ‘goddess,’ from Wikipedia.”
Jenny:​ Wow.
Kristin:​ I mean, goddess. Sourced from Wikipedia. “Cool, no? Citroen’s
styling and engineering were known for their innovation and uniqueness.
That racy, aerodynamic profile anticipates cars that came along much later.
Of course, French cars were never very successful in this country and were
kind of a joke from a practical perspective. But if you had ever ridden in a
Citroen and experienced its legendary suspension, I think you would have
more love for Giles’ choice of vehicle. I would assert that Whedon totally
nailed it when he gave Giles a Citroen and I suggest, in the future, more
admiration of the Gilesmobile is in order. Sincerely, Daniel.” [laughs]
Jenny:​ Okay, listen, Daniel. So, Citroen, eh?
Kristin:​ Citroen, I said it wrong the whole time. But I did a good job with
my reading, I think.
Jenny:​ You did a tremendous job.


Kristin:​ Thank you.
Jenny:​ Much emotion. So, here’s the thing. Um... any thing of beauty can
be left to, uh, deterioration. And that’s my... that’s what bums me out about
Giles’ car. I love the shape of it.
Kristin:​ Oooh!
Jenny:​ And I am a huge fan of smooth suspension. Kristin can attest.
Kristin:​ [laughs] For some reason, I feel like that could go in so many
directions.
Jenny:​ I– no, no, no, no, no. Just for cars. So...
Kristin:​ But– oh, I have to interject now, Jenny. Because you’re saying that
you are appreciative of what Daniel has given to us here, but you think Giles
has held onto this car for too long.
Jenny:​ Or he’s not taking care of it.
Kristin:​ Oh, well, what if he’s taking– what if he, first of all. There’s just so
much in there. Because Giles is–
Jenny:​ I know he’s busy.
Kristin:​ He’s so stressed out about taking good care of– well, no. I mean, I
just think he’s–
Jenny:​ Oh, of Buffy.
Kristin:​ Right. And what if he’s just had this car for so long, he loves this
car even though it’s falling apart. He wants to use this car, it means so much
to him.
Jenny:​ Okay.
Kristin:​ That’s a Giles character trait.


Jenny:​ [sighs] Yes, yes, yes.
Kristin:​ Admit defeat! [laughs]
Jenny:​ I don’t have to admit anything.
Kristin:​ I love this email. Daniel–
Jenny:​ Yeah, this is a great email, Daniel, thank you.
Kristin:​ Incredible. And we’re gonna have, like– so, we’re gonna go back
and forth, you know, doing some emails and some recordings from you all.
But I wanna say that we have three or four emails like this one, where you
have written in to tell us the most incredible information.
Jenny:​ Minutely detailed.
Kristin:​ Minutely detailed, organized in a beautiful fashion.
Jenny:​ Thoughtfully crafted.
Kristin:​ Yes. So thank you, thank you, thank you. I think this is an
appropriate time to hop to this email, from– well, you’ll say who it’s from,
Jenny, ‘cause it’s kind of the point.
Jenny:​ Well, it’s from... Cordelia. Not Cordelia Chase, but a whole other
Cordelia, if you can believe it.
Kristin:​ If you can believe it!
Jenny: ​Cordelia writes, “Hey there. Love the show. As a Cordelia, I just
wanted to thank you so much for the amazing Cordelia love theme, which
I’m using for my alarm and is giving me goddamn life in these dark times.
As both a Cordelia and a queer, I very much appreciate any situation where
I can hear cute girls talk about how much they love Cordelia. So thanks for
that too.” Wow.
Kristin:​ Wow.


Jenny:​ What an email.
Kristin:​ An email from a real life Cordelia.
Jenny:​ In the flesh, flesh and blood, ones and zeroes.
Kristin:​ [laughing] My day has been made. Also, we get to– we get called
“cute girls” in an– it’s just a winner of an email all–
Jenny:​ We assume that that’s– that they meant us.
Kristin:​ Well, yeah, right?
Jenny:​ I hope so.
Kristin:​ I mean, two cute girls talk about how much they love Cordelia. I
think that’s us.
Jenny:​ Oh my gosh.
Kristin:​ I know. It’s pretty great. So to you, Cordelia, and to any other
Cordelias–
Jenny:​ All the Cordelias out there.
Kristin:​ Yes. We love you.
Jenny:​ In Cordelia Land.
Kristin:​ You’re perfect.
[Jenny singing the “Cordelia” jingle]
Cordelia (ah-ahh)
I love you, Cordelia (ah-ahh)
You’re perfect, Cordelia (ah-ahh)
Jenny:​ So as we mentioned earlier, we put out a call to you all to send us
voice memos where you talk about your favorite moment of Season 1. And
we’re gonna listen to one now from a person who wished to remain


anonymous. But urged us to call them Angiles, which is of course the
contraction of Angel and Giles.
Kristin:​ Which they actually called a “portmanteau.”
Jenny:​ Ah, some people are grown-ups with grown-up words.
Kristin:​ A portmanteau of the two characters. I–
Jenny:​ Is that how you pronounce that word?
Kristin: ​I don’t know if that’s how– I hear it in my head. And like, haven’t
you heard that said before? Port-man-too?
Jenny:​ I’ve definitely seen the word but I don’t know if I’ve ever heard it
said it– I would– my guess would be, por-mon-tow or something. I’m sorry,
but I just didn’t–
Kristin:​ [laughs] Give that to us one more time? [Jenny laughs] Our friend
Mey Rude is gonna like that. Can you give us your pronunciation again?
Jenny:​ I gotta go. I actually have to get going.
Kristin:​ Let’s see. [recorded voice says: “port-man-toe.”] So... geez.
Jenny:​ Port​man​teau. Port​man​teau. Port​man​teau.
Kristin:​ Portman​teau​.
Jenny: ​No, she emphasized the “man.”
Kristin:​ Port​man​teau.
Jenny:​ Port​man​teau. Port​man​teau.
Kristin:​ Either way, we love the–
Jenny:​ Anyway, we love that new word. And we love this voice memo.


Kristin:​ Yes, let’s listen to, um–
Jenny:​ Angiles.
Kristin:​ Angiles.
[Voice memo] My favorite scene so far has to be when Angel and Buffy first
kiss. And then Angel’s face changes and reveals that he’s a vampire. The
first time I watched it, I was seeing it from Buffy’s perspective and
experiencing her shock when this beautiful, intimate moment is suddenly
shattered and she sees that this person who she has trusted and opened up
to is what she assumes to be a vicious killer.
Re-watching the episode after having watched all of ​Buffy​ and ​Angel​, I saw it
through Angel’s eyes instead. And I realized how scared ​he​ must be in this
scene. He has all these feelings for Buffy but has tried not to act on them,
thinking that he could never be with her. And knowing that if she ever found
out what he was, she would hate him and be disgusted by him. All of these
fears come true as his face changes and she screams in horror.
This scene really spoke to me because my sexuality has always been mixed
up with complicated and scary feelings about BDSM and gender identity. For
a long time, I was afraid of being intimate with partners because I thought
that they’d be horrified or disgusted if they saw who I really was.
Jenny:​ Angiles, you are so articulate.
Kristin:​ So articulate and like, what– I mean, this is kind of what we were
touching on, and we have touched on many times. But like, what we were
touching on a little bit before with ​X-Men​ and you know, how that was our
gateway in. And the things that these characters let us know about each
other and ourselves, you know? That like, we can see ourselves reflected in,
I think, the most important ways. And holy shit. There’s so much shame
around this, right? There’s so much shame around gender identity when it
doesn’t line up with what the world says that it’s supposed to line up with.
There’s so much shame around, you know, sex that is not vanilla.
Jenny:​ Right, right.


Kristin:​ For many of us. You know, I think maybe there’s some of us that
escape that net of shame. But I do think that the majority of us are told, you
know, this is right and this is wrong, this is good and this is bad. And so,
Angiles here, I think this is– I just think it’s so powerful.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Like, seeing yourself reflected in a character in a way that lets you
feel seen. And also, like, makes you dig deeper. Right?
Jenny: ​Yeah. Speaking of digging deeper.
Kristin:​ [laughs] So, we’re recording in a different location than usual.
We’re in Brooklyn still, recording this, and so we’re just recording it– you’ll
probably notice an audio difference as well because we’re just recording it,
um, on either an iPhone or a Zoom, we’ll see which one comes out better.
But we are also in an apartment with a wonderful cat named Vega.
Jenny:​ But he is mouthy!
Kristin:​ He’s ​very ​mouthy. Can we hear a little bit from Vega?
Jenny:​ Yeah, let’s play back Vega from before.
[loud cat meowing]
Kristin:​ [to Vega] What’s that, Vega? [cat meows] Really? [to Jenny] Great.
But also, on the flipside, we’re in an apartment that is equipped with a
recording studio. So Vega is now behind two panes of glass, meowing at the
top of his lungs. But you can’t– we can’t hear him. [laughs] He’s very mad.
Jenny:​ He’s like, “I have a lot to say about being seen in fantasy and
horror!”
Kristin:​ And it’s really funny to see a cat meow their hardest, when you
can’t hear anything coming out of their tiny cat mouth.
Jenny:​ It’s kind of sad.


Kristin:​ He’ll be fine. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Anyway!
Kristin:​ Anyway, back to you, Angiles. Sorry, Jenny, were you saying
something that–
Jenny:​ Who can tell?
Kristin:​ Do you have anything else you’d like to say?
Jenny:​ I mean, I just thought it was so great. And also, I can’t– Angiles, if
you just said that without writing it down and then reading it out loud, I am
floored​. That was just so beautiful.
Kristin:​ Yeah. It’s really beautiful. And thank you for sharing it with us and
with all of our listeners.
Jenny:​ Yeah, hell yeah.
Kristin:​ I’m sure there’s a lot of people listening who have similar feelings
about this. Or who didn’t even make the connection and just made the
connection for themselves now. Which is why art is cool.
Jenny:​ Yes. [Kristin laughs] Well said.
Kristin:​ Essay by Kristin Russo, who does not know how to pronounce
“portmanteau.”
Jenny:​ I think you just did it.
Kristin:​ I did. Oh! Speaking of things that we are made to feel shameful of,
um, you know, being a woman is one of them.
Jenny:​ Yes.
Kristin:​ And the reason I bring this up is to bring us to a very important
piece of information, which is over the holiday, we received some gifts.
Actually, I think there are more gifts that are waiting for us at home that we


have not gotten to yet. The gifts that we received before we left for the
holidays were incredible. And one of them, we posted online– well, actually
we posted several of them online. But one of the ones that we posted online
was a collection of chocolate. [Jenny groans] From a place– how do you
pronounce it, Jenny?
Jenny:​ Lagusta’s! Lagusta’s Luscious.
Kristin: ​Lagusta’s, Lagusta’s Luscious in New Paltz, New York.
Jenny:​ Woo!
Kristin:​ They sent us a custom made set of chocolates. If you haven’t seen
it yet, you can go on our Facebook or to our Twitter, both are just
@bufferingcast. And you can see a picture of these chocolates.
Jenny:​ Oh my god.
Kristin:​ Along with those chocolates–
Jenny:​ Beautiful and delicious.
Kristin:​ Delicious. By the way, the collected set was a chocolate vampire, a
chocolate aorta– I mean, a chocolate heart with–
Jenny:​ Anatomical heart.
Kristin:​ Anatomical heart. A chocolate skull... and a chocolate vulva.
Jenny:​ Yes, for good measure. Because of the patriarchy.
Kristin:​ Because of... the patriarchy, right. And so, along with these
chocolates came a mug. And the mug says, “Kill Your Local Misogynist.”
[Jenny laughs] It’s just a white mug with black text, you can see it also on
our socials. It is my favorite thing in the world. I don’t let Jenny use it. So
this is from one of the chocolatiers.
Jenny:​ Wooo!


Kristin:​ Whose name is Kate. Kate has made this mug. It is for sale and it’s
incredible because the mug is amazing, obviously. Kill your local misogynist.
[laughter] That’s pretty great. In her initial note to us, Kate said, “The only
people who didn’t like the mug were misogynists and moms.” [laughter]
Which I really liked. Moms are like, “But why would you say to kill
somebody?” You know? [Jenny laughs] That’s my universal mom voice.
Jenny:​ And misogynists are like, “Um…”
Kristin:​ [laughs] Misogynists are like, “You don’t deserve to speak. You’re a
woman.” So anyhow, everyone else who will be just as delighted with this
mug, I believe, as we are, um, can get one by just going to
TeamKate.storeenvy.com. And what’s fucking awesome about this is that
not only do you get an awesome mug, but all of the proceeds from the sale
of this mug go to the Sylvia Rivera Law Project and the Southern Poverty
Law Center.
Jenny:​ Yes!
Kristin:​ Just, come on! You know? Just the best!
Jenny:​ Yes.
Kristin:​ So I’m gonna be buying these “Kill Your Local Misogynist” mugs for
everyone I know. I suggest you do the same. Thank you, Kate, for gifting us
our first one.
Jenny:​ Oh, yes.
Kristin:​ Thank you, Kate and Adrienne, at Lagusta’s for that incredible
chocolate.
Jenny:​ Seriously.
Kristin:​ So thought out. So incredible and totally gone, because–
Jenny:​ [laughs] So eaten.
Kristin:​ [laughs] We ate it all. Cool. Okay.


Jenny:​ So next we’ve got another voice memo, coming in from Anna in
Green Bay, about “I, Robot... You, Jane.”
Kristin: ​Yes.
Jenny:​ And I mean, she really speaks well for herself, so I should just let
her talk.
[Voice memo] Hi, this is Anna from Green Bay, Wisconsin. My favorite
moment is in Episode 8, “I, Robot... You, Jane.” I love the part where Giles
tries to explain the demon in the internet to Jenny Calendar, only to have
her say “I know” and explain how she is a techno-pagan. Giles gets adorably
flustered while Jenny gives off some awesome 90s-style hacker vibes.
I was totally a teenage techno-pagan back in the late 90s, and this scene
brings back so many great memories of hanging around in online Wicca
message boards, my early attempts at computer programming, and even a
small crush on my computer science teacher. I just wish I’d watched this
show when it aired. It would have meant so much to me back then.
Kristin:​ Ugh!
Jenny: ​“I was a teenage techno-pagan!”
Kristin:​ [laughs] That’s– please, Anna, if you write a memoir–
Jenny:​ Let that be the title.
Kristin:​ Please let that be the title. How great is everyone?
Jenny:​ Everyone is so great. Everyone did such a great job with their
e-mails and their voice memos.
Kristin: ​And their favorite moments from season 1, and their
techno-paganry.
Jenny: ​Being a teenage techno-pagan! So good!


Kristin: ​[laughing] Were you big on, like, message boards and stuff?
Jenny:​ I was very active in the alternative music chat room, I don’t know
what, like I don’t know if it was under an umbrella.
Kristin:​ What was your username?
Jenny:​ I think my username was JennX, like J-e-n-n-X.
Kristin:​ Wow!
Jenny:​ Yeah…
Kristin: ​That’s so good!
Jenny:​ Thank you… thanks for your support.
Kristin:​ Jenn. X.
Jenny:​ Like, the last person I told this to was like, ‘that’s the worst thing
I’ve ever heard.’
Kristin:​ Who was that person?
Jenny: ​Ooh, I think it was Matt Mira.
Kristin:​ Nice, Matt Mira. [laughs] It’s the ​best​ thing I’ve ever heard, so.
Jenny:​ Well, that’s the only way you guys are different.
Kristin:​ If we ever get Matt on our show...
Jenny:​ We’ll have to grill him about it.
Kristin:​ We’ll argue, Matt and I will have a head-to-head.
Jenny:​ Oh, but then he said what his first username was and, it was really
good, but I can’t remember what it was.


Kristin:​ Well. In a future episode to come. We’ll have to remember to ask
Matt those questions. Um, so yeah and I- my first user name was very
boring. It doesn’t have anyJenny: ​Was it like, “Kristin”?
Kristin:​ It was Kris3918, because my best friends had gone away to college,
and the last four digits of my best friend’s SUNY Oswego phone number was
3918, [interrupts herself] and like, to give me a little credit, in the 1990s
when you were creating a username, you didn’t realize that you would have
it forever. You know what I mean? That Kris3918 would become my
moniker. Moniker?
Jenny:​ Sure.
Kristin:​ For nearly a lifetime, so I was just like “Kris, and these numbers I
call all the time, 3918!” I don’t know.
Jenny:​ Yeah, wow.
Kristin: ​ But I wasn’t very active. I mean, I would go on AOL chat rooms,
but I didn’t have like, you know, pages and stuff until Myspace came along.
Jenny: ​ Mmm!
Kristin: ​Um, but I was still very confused about Myspace. Whatever that
guy’s name was that was everybody’s friend?
Jenny: ​ Tom?
Kristin: ​Tom.
Jenny: ​[slightly mocking]​ ​“Everybody’s friend.”
Kristin: ​Well I didn’t know!​ ​See and I don’t even remember who told me to
go on it, but I went on it and I was like “You see? I’ve been on this thing for
one second and I already have some weirdo that I don’t know who’s...
Jenny:​ Oh my god, you didn’t realize that he ​was​ Myspace? -


Kristin: ​...friended me. No, no! I didn’t know.
Jenny:​ Wow.
Kristin:​ Anyway. But I did get heavy into illegal music down- well, ​legal​,
but illegal, music downloads.
Jenny: ​[pauses]​ ​Legal but illegal?
Kristin:​ I mean, I think that Napster was probably always kind of illegal but
it wasn’t like, there were no regulations on it when Napster first came on the
scene. Like, as a kid, you must have gone through this too, I didn’t know
that what I was doing was wrong, I was just likeJenny: ​I never downloaded music illegally.
Kristin:​ Really?
Jenny:​ I have never. To this day.
Kristin:​ Because you’re a musician and you were aware from the start?
Jenny:​ Um, no, because I was like, why would… I was really into collecting.
Albums.
Kristin: ​Oh, so like physical copies of stuff.
Jenny: ​I just wasn’t exposed, I was just more interested in getting the
records and listening to them and not… I was like “why would you ever just
want to have, like, a digital file of music when you could have a CD?”
Kristin:​ ​Ohh, my.
Jenny: ​Yeah, that’s me.
Kristin:​ Good old JennX strikes again. [laughs] Well, I did, I thought it was
the coolest thing in the world.


Jenny:​ Gross. I still think it’s gross.
Kristin:​ Well I mean now, we have more- I think you need to take a deep
fuckin’ breath...
Jenny:​ I’m entitled to my opinions and I’ll breathe when I want!
Kristin:​ But your opinion is very judgy of Kristin Russo 1998 right now.
Jenny:​ Noooo, no no no no no, no.
Kristin:​ You’re like ‘I never did that and I would never do it and I find it
disgusting’ and then you spit on the floor.
Jenny: ​I did spit on the floor.
Kristin: ​ I’m just saying that before I had awareness of music and the craft
of music, it was just like ‘Holy shit! I can download all this stuff and I can
listen to all this new stuff’ it was so awesome and I learned about so much
music through it, and then it was like ‘Napster is actually illegal!’ and we
were all like [skrrrrk!]
Jenny:​ Yeah and Metallica was like [whiny] “Where’s our money? Waaah!”
I mean...
Kristin: ​Wow. So much judgement from all angles coming from JennX over
in the corner.
Jenny:​ I gotta be me.
Kristin:​ Well, thank you Anna, thank you for your wonderful voicemail. We
actually, speaking of e-mails that have a lot of fantastic information in them
relatedly to this “I Robot, You Jane” episode...
Jenny:​ Oh my god, this is a really...
Kristin:​ Do you want to set this, set this up? Set the stage for why this
e-mail got sent to us?


Jenny:​ So, you may recall in the cold open of “I Robot, You Jane”, we see
Thelonius Monk- we see a monk named Thelonius, speaking Italian and we
also see Moloch speaking Italian and we see his acolyte speaking Italian, and
we were talking about ‘Is this really Italian, is this time-era appropriate
Italian, or like what’s the deal?’ So we got this ​incredibly​ informative and
exhaustively detailed e-mail from McKayla... that is just really something.
Kristin: ​Yeah. I mean, I’m gonna read a little chunk of it, I think. But the
full- where I’m gonna stop, it stops right before we get a line-by-line
translation and conversation about that translation. It’s incredible. It’s a
miracle. So, we’re gonna put this up on our facebook page today, which is
just facebook.com/bufferingcast with the full translation because it is really
special.
Jenny: ​Oh my god, it’s so good.
Kristin:​ But let me give you just a little bit.
Jenny:​ Just a taste.
Kristin:​ From McKayla here. Okay, so McKayla says “...as an Italian major
at university I thought I’d tell you guys my useless rant about the Italian
used in this scene since no one else in my life is going to give a shit. First
off, in 1418, ​no one​ would be speaking modern Italian. Modern Italian
wasn’t even a concept until much, much more recently, and even today, not
everyone in Italy speaks the same Italian. What Moloch and the others in
that scene were using was modern Northern Italian, and even then they
weren’t always using it right. If this show were being historically accurate,
they would more than likely have been using the ​volgare,​ the common,
latinate language used by the common and merchant classes at the time. It
would have also had strong regional influences, as the city of Cortona is in
Tuscany. Also, for anything religious, they probably still would have been
using Latin.
Jenny:​ Wow.
Kristin: ​[continues reading] “Secondly, when the minion whose neck is
broken is speaking to Moloch, he is using the ​tu​ form. Anyone who has
studied Romance language knows that there are two ways of addressing


people, formally and informally. This minion absolutely ​would not ​have been
addressing someone he reveres so informally as to use the ​tu​; he would
have used the​ Lei​, which would have been the formal form at the time.
Moloch may have used the informal when speaking back, but the minion
absolutely should not have been using it. That would be extremely
disrespectful, and from the scene, he did not seem to want to cause
disrespect.”
Jenny:​ Mm-hmm!! This is amazing.
Kristin:​ It’s amaz- so, McKayla, thank you, and for those of you who are as
super fucking into this as we are, McKayla goes on to do a line-by-line, you
know…
Jenny and Kristin:​ dissection!
Kristin: ​of Moloch’s words and the minions’ words and like, just, oh, it’s just
great. So, go over to our facebook page today. It’ll be one of the most
recent posts if not the most recent post, will have this full analysis from
McKayla!
Jenny:​ God, it’s so amazing.
Kristin:​ Ah! [reading] “Disclaimer: I am but a humble fourth-semester
Italian student” Like, you’re doing great, McKayla.
Jenny:​ Much better than anybody in this room, for sure. Holy smokes.
Kristin:​ Oh, yes. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Jenny:​ Thank you McKayla! So next we have the shortest e-mail ever, from
Jeff.
Kristin:​ Yes, we went from the longest e-mail to the shortest e-mail.
Jenny:​ Indeed. Sharp relief. And, Jeff says: “I literally just thought of this
and decided to send it your way. Buffy’s high school is the same one they
used for ​Beverly Hills, 90210​. No idea if you guys knew that or not.” Thank
you, Jeff!


Kristin:​ Thank you, Jeff!
Jenny:​ That’s Torrance High School, right?
Kristin:​ Yes, it is Torrance High School in California. A place where Jenny
and I will... indubitably be. [quietly] What does indubitably mean?
Jenny:​ Uh, I think that’s- I think you’re using it the way you mean to use
it. I think!
Kristin:​ My brain is so weird, you guys. Like, it has words in it that it’ll just
throw out, it’s like ‘I think this goes here.’ But if you said ‘What does
indubitably mean?’, I’m like ‘No idea.’ I just think contextually it would fit in
that sentence.
Jenny:​ Yeah, I think it means like ‘def.’
Kristin:​ Undoubtedly? Is how I have it.
Jenny:​ That’s… yeah, that seems right. Let’s not look it up. Let’s just let
this lie.
Kristin:​ Yeah, it’s just Kristin’s- in a new segment called ​Kristin Makes Up
Definitions​ ​To Words.​ Um cool, so yeah we will for sure be going to
Torrance High School at some point to do something fun.
Jenny:​ And there will be photographic evidence.
Kristin:​ Also, if for any reason you are listening to this podcast and you
went to Torrance High School, back in the heyday…
Jenny:​ Please e-mail us!
Kristin:​ … please e-mail us at bufferingthevampireslayer at gmail dot com
because we would love to talk to you about your experiences at Torrance
High School.
Jenny:​ Please!


Kristin:​ Home of Brenda and Brandon. Angel and Buffy.
Jenny:​ I don’t know if Angel ever… well I guess he hangs out at the library.
Kristin:​ Well, he hangs out. Yeah, he’s there.
Jenny:​ Perfect. Perfect!
Kristin:​ Anyway, thank you Jeff for this, I’m sure many of you knew this
already, but I did not know this and so I’m sure that the Kristins of the
world, who are looking up ‘indubitably’, [​Jenny:​ Ha ha!] did not know this
either so y’all just learned a little somethin’. We have an email from
Kenneth, who says- now this is sent to us, to give you some context, the
morning of November 9th. Um, that was actuallyJenny:​ 2016.
Kristin:​ Yes! That’s right, it’s true. When this sound file is in space.
Jenny:​ Yeah! In the voidKristin:​ They’ll all be like ‘If only they had let us know!’ Okay, so I just got
so distracted thinking about them saying, like, hearing us call them out on
being excited about the year and then laughing at us. [Jenny laughs] So,
it’s fine! Kenneth e-mails us the morning after the 2016 election. And the
morning of our “I Robot, You Jane” episode where we put a little pre-roll in.
Jenny:​ [solemnly] Yeah, we just put a little message up front, because we
felt very… sad? And very scared, and we felt like a lot of you might be
feeling that way, and we wanted to share something with you that might feel
a little hopeful. So we shared a quote from a later episode of ​Buffy​, and
that’s what we did.
Kristin:​ Right. Yeah, and so then Kenneth wrote in and said that “waking
up this morning was unreal... I got one hour and thirteen minutes of peace
today while I was listening to today’s episode of ​Buffering​, thank you for
giving me something funny and positive. Thank you for giving me
something awesome about something I love. I’m so thankful for your


podcast, the work that you do with the LGBT community, and that you are
strong, proud women. I hope, if I have a daughter, she has the same
strength and pride.” And this last bit is why I wanna read this e-mail the
most: “I’m going to use this as inspiration and go to my local city council
meeting tonight. Hopefully I can start the changes I want to see in the
world. All the best, Kenneth.”
Jenny:​ Oh, no!
Kristin: ​ Jenny, are you crying?!
Jenny:​ Not quite!
Kristin:​ Is it ‘cause I did such a good reading of something you had already
read, that it hit you in a whole new way?
Jenny​: Yes.
Kristin: ​ This is just like, everything. Right? You know, where this show
exists and it forms this space where we all get to say ‘We like this thing, let’s
get together and sit in this space together and talk about this thing together
and love this thing together’ and then bad shit happens and we’re in this
space together and we get to kind of like turn over shit in our hands and say
‘Well I can use this piece from this space to help me or I can use this piece’
or ‘Listen to what that person is doing with this space that helps me navigate
this thing’ and I don’t- I could not dream up a more powerful end result, not
that it’s the end, but you know what I mean. In this arc, than you standing
up and saying ‘I need to do more, I’m gonna go to this local government
meeting and participate.’ Because that is, that’s everything.
And so often I think, not to get all politicky, but I think so often in politics
we think about the biggest votes, like ‘I’m gonna vote for the president, I’m
gonna vote for the vice-president, I’m gonna vote for senators’. Those are
all important votes, certainly, but a lot of us neglect to participate at the
local level, and what we set down at the local level often is the current that
pushes the larger stream. So, all the thanks to you, Kenneth, for
participating, and all the love to the rest of you out there who are searching
out ways to get involved. This is a great way to get involved, with your local
government. Super powerful stuff. I also think that there’s a ton of ways


that you can give back right now, whether it is going to that local city council
meeting, volunteering, or like, creating a piece of music that you share with
the world. You know, there’s so many different avenues.
Jenny:​ Oh! I can do that one.
Kristin: ​ You can do that one?
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Okay! So let’s go to another recording now, from Scott, in
Philadelphia, who has some stuff to say about... Cordelia! You know you’re
gonna get played on this show when you got Cordelia commentary.
Jenny:​ Mm-HM!
[Voice memo] Hi, this is Scott, from Philadelphia. I happened upon​ Buffy​ as
the show began, so all of my first impressions were my own, and I
remember loving the show for its cleverness and its wit, but I do recall when
I first saw the “Nightmares” episode, really being hit by Cordelia’s speech.
When she talked about being alone even when she was surrounded by
people, it reminded me how deep the show could be and how it was always
going to flip expectations and show you a different side. Cordelia wasn’t just
the “Queen Bitch”, she was a person and she had depth and a point of view,
and that’s why I loved that moment and it remains my favorite moment
from Season 1.
Jenny:​ Yeeeessss!
Kristin: ​Yes! Yes, Scott from Philly!
Jenny:​ Whooo, you are right on.
Kristin:​ You got it! You got it, you really got it.
Jenny:​ Nailed it. Nail, meet hammer.
Kristin:​ And you know who else really got it? Cordelia.


Jenny:​ Uh, accurate.
Kristin:​ Yes, totally agree. Totally why I love Cordelia, totally why I love
Joss Whedon.
Jenny:​ Love to see this vulnerability shining through the cracks…
Kristin:​ Yes!
Jenny:​ … In her carefully constructed facade.
Kristin:​ Because it exists in all- I mean, nobody’s just…
Jenny:​ One thing.
Kristin:​ Right. Nobody’s just one thing. Certainly none of the characters in
Buffy the Vampire Slayer​.
Jenny:​ Are just one thing.
Kristin:​ Right. I was gonna say ‘Except for maybe The Master’ but like,
you know what, damn it, even The Master is certainly not just one thing.
Jenny:​ He’s evil but he’s also kind of a like tap-dancer. [Kristin laughs]
You know, da-da-da, da-da-da, psh!
Kristin:​ Right. Yes, so thank you so much for that.
Jenny:​ Okay so next we have my favorite e-mail of all-time.
Kristin:​ Wow.
Jenny:​ Is that too much? Can I read this?
Kristin​: Yeah.
Jenny:​ This e-mail comes from Herkie, the subject is “Daddy Long Legs!”
(Exclamation point). And Herkie says “Hey, friends. Knowing how nerds are
on the internet, I figure you’ve already received possibly hundreds of notes


regarding this, since I’m a little late on listening. But just in case you
haven’t, I thought this was something worth pointing out. In “Nightmares,”
you discuss spiders and how one should never be okay with one crawling on
you except for possibly daddy long legs.”
First of all, I feel confident that I never said that was okay. [Kristin laughs]
“Once the conversation started focusing on them, I immediately thought
‘Please don’t say they are the most poisonous spider. Please don’t say they
are the most poisonous spider.’ And then, ​Jenny​, it happened.”
Me?
Kristin:​ You.
Jenny:​ [reading] “It’s okay! It’s not your fault! This is a widely-spread myth
that somehow has reached so many over the years that most just accept it
as fact. However, this is very far from the truth. Daddy long legs are
harmless. Not because they don’t have fangs that can pierce your skin but
because they don’t have fangs, or venom, at all. In fact, they’re not even in
the same species as regular spiders which is why they don’t have eight eyes
and they have just a single body rather than a separated abdomen and
cephalothorax, like spiders generally do.” Of course. “Much like scorpions
or mites, they’re arachnids but not spiders.” Then a link to an in-depth
rundown - but I feel like this was already an in-depth rundown? “Sorry for
science nerding-out on you all, though I’m sure Jenny can appreciate some
good science nerding-out every once in awhile. Stay groovy. Herkie.”
Thank you, Herkie, for the greatest e-mail of all-time!
Kristin:​ Okay! So, rounding the bend here to our last voice memo…
Jenny:​ Wow.
Kristin:​ I know, I know, it’s gone so quickly.
Jenny:​ It went so by so fast.
Kristin:​ It did! We got a recording from Vanessa, who actually is also from
Philly. Two-


Jenny:​ Yeah what’s up with Philly? Y’all holdin’ it down. Should we go to
Philly?
Kristin:​ Yeah, two Philadelphia entries, maybe we should go to Philly?
Jenny:​ Alright.
Kristin:​ [quietly] Everybody in Philly just got very excited. Future plans, TK.
TK. Okay, so Vanessa from Philly talks about “Prophecy Girl” so let’s just
shut up and listen to Vanessa, shall we? [Jenny laughs]
[Voice memo] Hello, my name is Vanessa, I’m calling in from Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania and my thoughts on the first season of ​Buffy...​ Not really a
fan of it, it’s always a little hard for me to get through, but it’s totally worth
it when I get to “Prophecy Girl”. ‘Cause one of my favorite moments in the
entire series is when Buffy’s having her confrontation with Giles and Angel,
and she has her line “I’m sixteen. I don’t want to die.” I find it’s the first
moment in the series so far that has this real, emotional weight and this
rawness, and that’s a big reason why I love ​Buffy​ so much and I keep on
coming back and rewatching it. And it’s also the first time you get to see
Sarah Michelle Gellar really act and you get to see her do what she does
best. And that is rip your heart out and it’s only the beginning, but… thank
you Kristin, thank you Jenny for an awesome podcast and I can’t wait for
Season 2.”
Kristin:​ You know why I love this? And like, obviously we chose to round
the bend to the ending with this one ‘cause it is from “Prophecy Girl” but it’s
also, I think, pretty great because of how, Vanessa, you talk about, [laughs]
I think you don’t even really like Season 1, ‘cause I think a lot of people feel
like thatJenny:​ Yeah, way I feel about it.
Kristin:​ Right, I mean I.. turns out...
Jenny:​ It’s fine. It’s great.
Kristin:​ I’m into it, but also my relationship to it is so different, I think, than


most people’s. But I think that everybody understands what you’re saying
here, and I had that moment watching “Prophecy Girl” where I was all of a
sudden like: [gasps] I remember.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ I forgot, and I remember now what this series can do and what
Buffy can do and what my emotions will soon do. I just want to stop for
one second and give everybody a cat update. The cat is now standing on
two back legs, tapping his paws on the glass, becauseJenny:​ “Pardon me, you seem to have forgotten…”
Kristin:​ He’s concerned. We’ll try to get a picture of Vega for you so you
can see Vega. Anyhow! I really so identify with everything that you’re
saying, Vanessa, and ohmygosh, because the next episode we will be talking
about is our entry point into Season 2, where I think we start to get more,
many more moments like this one that are so real, and so gutting. I’m so
excited.
Jenny​: Yeah, oh my god. It’s really… just like, the door has been cracked.
Kristin:​ Is there a thing, Jenny, about Season 2, that is not a spoiler but
perhaps a character or whatever that you’re most excitedJenny:​ There are just ​so​ many peaks and valleys. It is a big, sexy roller
coaster and it’s gonna fuck you up if you haven’t seen it before!
Kristin:​ Ahh, if you haven’t seen it before, holy shit, buckle up! Buckle up!
Jenny:​ Please buckle up, for safety.
Kristin:​ Yes, for safety. Um, great!
Jenny:​ Wow.
Kristin:​ Well, I think we did it.
Jenny:​ We really did.
