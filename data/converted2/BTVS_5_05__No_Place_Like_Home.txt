Buffering the Vampire Slayer
Episode 5.05: No Place Like Home
Jenny:​ Today's episode is supported by Mack Weldon. One of the great truths of
human existence as we know it is that, at least some of the time, you have to
ensconce your torso in something. And if you're gonna ensconce your torso in
something, why not make sure it's the softest something available? Wearing a Mack
Weldon t-shirt is like wrapping yourself in a dream. I can't recommend them
enough. For 20% off your first order, visit MackWeldon.com and enter promo code

Kristin:​ Today's episode is brought to you by Buffy. The comforter, that is. Buffy
makes bedding that is earth-friendly and cruelty free. Their latest product, The
Breeze, is a comforter made entirely from 100% eucalyptus fiber to regulate
temperature and keep you cool and comfortable all night long. Also, Buffy offers a
free trial, so if you don't love it, you return it at no cost. For $20 off your Buffy
comforter, visit buffy.co and enter code "buffering." That's Buffy.co and enter code

[CHIME]
Jenny:​ Well, hello!
Kristin:​ Oh, hi!
Jenny:​ Hey!
Kristin:​ How's it going? Here we are, in yet another intro, Jenny. It's a big one.
Jenny:​ It truly is. And we can't be stopped. We will introduce every single freaking
episode, whether you like it or not. [Kristin laughs] If you missed it, we are having
our third annual prom in Brooklyn, New York, and we are making it a two-night
affair this time around.
Kristin:​ Yeah!
Jenny:​ On Friday, April 17th, we'll be doing a live taping of I Was Made to Love
You. And on Saturday, April 18th, we will be dancing the night away, decked out in
our prom and cosplay best, to our favorite hits from the late 90s and live music by
yours truly, plus special guests.
Kristin:​ Yes. We sold out of all of our VIP level tickets to our patrons. We also sold
through the entire first round of the bundled tickets on Patreon in less than two


hours, all those tickets went. So we added some more bundles for our patrons that
are now no more. So the tickets that have been released today are for you, the
public, everyone. You can head on over to bufferingthevampireslayer.com/prom for
all of your ticketing needs. Those tickets are now being sold individually, so you can
get one ticket for the taping, you can get one ticket for prom. Or if they are still
there, you can get one ticket for each. But the bundles are no more, those all went
to our very, very hungry for prom patrons. [laughs] Lastly, for prom, we're gonna
be hosting both events at the Bell House, which is a gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous
space in Brooklyn and we are so excited. Speaking of gorgeous things, Jenny.
Jenny:​ Mmm, yes?
Kristin:​ We have—
Jenny:​ Anya.
Kristin:​ Uh, yes, Anya is gorgeous, that is correct. But in addition to Anya, we have
so many gorgeous new items in our store, in our US store, in anticipation of the
holidays.
Jenny:​ Yes, yes, yes.
Kristin:​ We have two new shirts out today. They're both designed by John-Allison
Weiss. One is a Sleepaway Witch Camp t-shirt. Honestly, I think it might be my
favorite t-shirt of all—like, I think it might be my favorite t-shirt we've ever made.
And we—
Jenny:​ It's beautiful.
Kristin:​ It's so beautiful and we're just really excited, so we put this Sleepaway
Witch Camp t-shirt—that, by the way, says in quotes underneath the Sleepaway
Witch Camp logo: "move a vending machine." It's pretty great.
Jenny:​ Every camp needs a motto.
Kristin:​ Oh my god. And we put it up in two color combinations for you, there's a
gray with black ink, there's a maroon with sort of orangey ink. Really cool stuff. We
also have a freaking new sweatshirt. It's a crewneck sweatshirt by popular demand.
It says "Tis the season, whatever that means."
Jenny:​ "Whatever that means!"


Kristin:​ [laughs] It has a stake and Faith's knife and snowflakes. It's gorgeous, it's
so exciting. It really is the season. Whatever that means.
Jenny:​ Faith will try to tell you it's crappy, but it's the opposite of crappy. [Kristin
laughs] It's… magnificent. We also have some really fun Smash the Demon Lizard
Patriarchy stuff, including a new limited edition Demon Lizard tee that is black with
gold foil print. So festive! Also, for the Jennys of the world, Jennys unite, a beautiful
green speckled diner mug. Ahhh! And also. Are you ready? A holiday ornament. A
beautiful, shiny, green ball… [Kristin laughs] featuring the Smash the Demon Lizard
Patriarchy logo. It is so lovely to look upon, lovely to hold. If you break it, consider
it sold. Hang it on the tree and party with me.
Kristin:​ [laughing] Wow.
Jenny:​ This is a poem from your friend, Jenny.
Kristin:​ I really, really, really hope that somebody out there sends us a photo
[Jenny laughs] where they're wearing their Smash the Demon Lizard Patriarchy
shirt, sipping their coffee out of a Smash the Demon Lizard Patriarchy mug, while
sitting by their tree decorated with their Smash the Demon Lizard Patriarchy
bauble.
Jenny:​ To really nail that image, I think they're gonna have to buy, like, a hundred
of the ornament—
Kristin:​ That's true, decorate the whole tree—
Jenny:​ And it needs to be the only thing on the tree. [laughs]
Kristin:​ Oh my god. Oh my god, yes. Wow.
Jenny:​ That'll be me, actually. I'll be doing that, so.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Listen, one other new thing is coming your way in this episode.
Because—I'm not gonna tell you what it's for, but Jenny, you made a new jingle for
us this week, didn't you?
Jenny:​ It's my finest work.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ It's my greatest accomplishment.


Kristin:​ It truly is, I think.
Jenny:​ I put all of my heart and all of my soul and all of my brain and all of my
many, many dollar bills into it.
Kristin:​ Ha-ha-ha!
Jenny:​ All my resources.
Kristin:​ Yes!
Jenny:​ For something I truly believe in.
Kristin:​ So...just like, get on into the episode in a few minutes and enjoy that. And
this is a reminder that all of our jingles are available the moment that they release
for our patrons that are at the $5 level or higher. They also get all the music that
comes at the end of the episode when it releases. A lot of the jingles, you can
also—if you're not a patron of ours—a lot of them, you can go to the Jingles page
and some of them are available for purchase. Some of 'em—one of 'em—is available
for free. The Patriarchy jingle.
Jenny:​ Yeah, as you so aptly put it on the page, hasn't it cost us all enough
already?
Kristin:​ [laughs] I got jokes.
Jenny:​ [laughs] Okay, so. Hard shift from economy to sex—okay. [both laugh]
Hard shift from that discussion to everyone's favorite four-category polling activity
on a bi-weekly basis, the Sexual Tension Awards! Here. Are. Some. Results! From
the last episode, Out of my Mind. With a pathetic 4% of the vote— [both laugh] in
last place, we have Spike and the doctor. Apparently—apparently Time Winter and
James Marsters don't have the kind of chemistry [Kristin laughs] that you need to
seriously get in the running for this competition.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ Then, in a turn no one saw coming, in third place for probably the only time
that this has happened—
Kristin:​ It's true.
Jenny:​ That they've been in a nomination slot. Willow and Tara have just 13% of
the vote. New era.


Kristin:​ Yeah, I mean, you know. Tara needs to up her palm-reading game. Maybe
she could get some more percentage points.
Jenny:​ Oh, true. True. [both laugh] Then in second place, we have a pairing that I
thought might do a little bit better than this. With 17% of the vote, we've got
Spike… and the blood of the Slayer.
Kristin:​ Mm-hmm. I thought it would do good, but I knew that this one was gonna
take the cake.
Jenny:​ Well, yes. How could this not take the cake? The entree, the wine, and
everything else. The tablecloth. [Kristin laughs] The cat who, like, hangs out in the
kitchen and chases mice. In first place, with a tidal wave of 66% of the vote, we
have Spike and Dream Buffy.
Kristin:​ Only 3% away from 69%. What a sad, sad story.
Jenny:​ [laughing] Oh! Opportunity missed.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Well, those are your results for Episode 4 of Season 5 Sexual
Tension Awards. Just a couple more quick things before we get into today's
episode. I wanna let you know that in addition to those jingles I was talking about
that you get on Patreon, there's a lot of other stuff that goes on. You all voted and
on December 21, we will be doing a Buffy Watch of Fool For Love. Which is gonna
be a lot of fun, I think, because it'll be after we do our live taping in San Francisco,
so we're gonna have a lot to discuss and unpack.
Jenny:​ Oh, yes.
Kristin:​ However, I put Scream 2 on the list because I desperately wanted to
watch it with all of you. And it almost won, so I've convinced Jenny to do another
[Jenny laughs] Buffy Watch on January 11—
Jenny:​ This is like…
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ The most Kristin move of all time. [laughs]
Kristin:​ I was like, "but I wanna—!" [laughs] And Jenny was like—


Jenny:​ But what about the thing I wanna watch? And you're like, "it's not enough
for me to just watch it by myself or with friends or with my cats."
Kristin:​ No.
Jenny:​ Everyone must watch it, we must enjoy it together, we must commune—
Kristin:​ Yes, it was important.
Jenny:​ Around the sacred altar of Scream 2.
Kristin:​ [laughs] So January 11, we'll be watching Scream 2. And then, Jenny,
you're gonna be doing something fun on the 22nd of February, aren't ya?
Jenny:​ That's right, it's time for another Jenny Owen-Youngs sings the Buffering
the Vampire Slayer songbook in usually the key of beautiful C-major but
occasionally some other not-too-far-away from the key of C-major keys… live. A
very special even— [laughs] I'm trying—try and run out of concert-related lingo.
[Kristin laughs] And I don't even know if I finished the thought, but basically, I'm
playing a streaming concert for our beautiful patrons. I'll be playing some Buffering
the Vampire Slayer songs. It's gonna be a hoot, it's gonna be a holler. Please join
me, February 22. Yes! That's 2/22/20.
Kristin:​ Yeah, actually, the dates for all those things are kind of weird. 12/21, 1/11
and 2/22. It's like, almost a bunch of 1s and 0s. Are we resurrecting Adam with
these three livestreaming events? That's my question.
Jenny:​ Mommy…
Kristin:​ [laughs] And if you're wondering how you can join in on all of this, plus the
holiday gift exchange, that is happening right now!
Jenny:​ Oh my god!
Kristin:​ That's right. Jenny and I get in on it too, somebody gets matched with
Jenny, somebody gets matched with me. And all of our Scoobies who are in that
Facebook group and want to join and we all exchange gifts. It's so much fricking
fun! So you can find out about all of this by going to
bufferingthevampireslayer.com, just click on Patreon. All of the things we just
talked about, except for the jingles, go to every level. So you can give at any level
for those things. The jingles and the music go to $5 and higher. Also, $10 level, you
get 20% off merch and also a mailbag coming your way in literally two days. Ha!
Okay.


Jenny:​ That's 20% off Christmas balls. [Kristin starts laughing] That's 20% off
speckled diner mugs. That's 20% off gold foil t-shirts. That's 20—
Kristin:​ If I had a cane—like, if I had one of those loopy canes, I would literally
drag you off the stage right now.
Jenny:​ That would be a long-ass—that would be a 3,000-mile long cane. [both
laugh] From New York to LA.
Kristin:​ Before I drag you off the stage, Jenny, I wanna say—I wanna say two
things. One, we'll get to in a second. But the first is that Paste Magazine, just a few
days ago, released a list of the top 30 podcasts—not of 2019, but of the decade!
And they named Buffering the Vampire Slayer as one of those 30 podcasts, the top
of the decade. And I just wanted to, like, give a special thanks to Paste. And maybe
even more so than that, a special thanks to all of you, because quite literally this is
the reason why we're here and doing the work and we love our community. And it's
just amazing, right? Jenny and I were like, whaaat?! [laughs]
Jenny:​ Yeah, it's totally bananas. It is mind-boggling. The brain reels upon the rod,
as I always say.
Kristin:​ You're really going for it today in this intro, Jenny. [Jenny laughs] I'll tell
you what. Alright, I'm gonna take Jenny's voice from her like Ursula took from
Ariel.
Jenny:​ O… kay!
Kristin:​ Because it's time! [laughs] For Spooky News.
[SPOOKY NEWS jingle plays]
Spooky news!
Kristin:​ Jenny, guess what I got for you today?
Jenny:​ Is it a story about some skeletons?
Kristin:​ It's not. It's about a bat, though a bat does have a skeleton.
Jenny:​ [gasps and starts coughing] [Kristin laughs] Wow, I got so excited I almost
breathed my coffee into my lungs. A bat?!
Kristin:​ A bat!


Jenny:​ What kind of bat?!
Kristin:​ So this is a story from May of this year. An 86-year-old man… picked up
his iPad—
Jenny:​ I thought you were gonna say an 86-year-old bat.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Sorry, yeah, that was an unfortunate lead-in. No, I don't think
bats can live that long, unless they're Dracula. But an 86-year-old man picked up
his iPad. Jenny, he used his iPad for an hour, an entire hour. At about the hour
mark, a fucking bat popped its fucking head out of the iPad case and bit him!
[laughs]
Jenny:​ [laughing] Oh my god!
Kristin:​ So! This happened in New Hampshire. And actually, the guy got rabies.
But he got treated for it, he's okay—
Jenny:​ Holy shit!
Kristin:​ I know! The bat's not okay, but the guy is okay. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Okay, he's gonna be okay—I didn't even know you could still get rabies. I
thought… that was done.
Kristin:​ Yeah. So like, watch out!
Jenny:​ Damn!
Kristin:​ Apparently, bat—they have no idea how the bat got in the iPad, so.
[laughs]
Jenny:​ Yeah, always check your iPad ca—I'm also just trying to envision what the
hell kind of iPad ca—how big is this bat? We need more details.
Kristin:​ Okay, I'll try. I'll try to dig some more up for you, Jenny.
Jenny:​ Thank you.
Kristin:​ That, in the meantime, has been your Spooky News.
[SPOOKY NEWS jingle plays]


Spooky news!
Jenny:​ Also, okay. There's still a handful of tickets available for our San Francisco
show on December 6. The tickets are on our website. No bats allowed,
unfortunately.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Yeah.
Jenny:​ But if you're not a bat, please grab a ticket and come.
Kristin:​ It's true. I just have a really tiny thing that I wanna say. I have a
sweatshirt up in my personal store. It says Everyone is Gay on it and the reason
I'm telling you this is because it's not a sweatshirt that I sell anymore. I just
released it for the holidays, and today, November 13, is the very last day that you
can grab this sweatshirt, until at least next year but who knows when I'll bring it
back? So if you want that, you can go to my store, kristinnoeline.com, just click on
Shop. I'm in Hello Merch so if you wanna pick up all your holiday goods and throw
the Everyone is Gay sweatshirt in the bin too, you can do that. But literally, today.
After today, no more.
Jenny:​ Also, holy shit. It's a really big week for me, if you don't mind. My EP, Night
Shift, is coming out on Friday! That's in two days, if you're listening to this on the
day it comes out.
Kristin:​ Holy shit.
Jenny:​ And you can still snag it via preorder on my website at
jennyowenyoungs.com. I ship out the preorders directly. They'll be up until… that
page will be up until the 15th, and then after that, you'll be able to get the EP and
all of the associated goods, merch, illustrated lyric book, et cetera, over in my Hello
Merch store. And if you order an EIG sweatshirt and a copy of my EP, you can
combine the shipping, and isn't that nice?
Kristin:​ Wow. It'll be like a Russo-Youngs-Buffering family affair.
Jenny:​ Correct.
Kristin: ​In your shopping cart. Jenny—
Jenny:​ Yes!
Kristin:​ Jenny, also, I just had this thought. I would imagine if people preorder
your EP in the next couple days before you are not shipping the orders anymore,


the odds of them randomly getting a package that also contains a small business
card with you dressed as a unicorn— [Jenny starts laughing] is higher. Is that
correct?
Jenny:​ Yes. Any and all preorders received and shipped by me… between now,
November 13, and Friday November 15, will include a tiny business card of my
unicorn photograph. You're welcome.
Kristin: ​It's not a big deal, I just surprised Jenny by sending her 100 business
cards that no of her personal information on them whatsoever. It's just her—
Jenny:​ Yeah, zero purpose of any kind, other than just to spread the word about
my unicorn onesie. [laughs]
Kristin:​ So get on over there. We've given you a lot to do! 'Tis the season! And we
know what that means, don't we?
[Buffering the Vampire Slayer theme plays]
Jenny:​ Hello and welcome to Buffering the Vampire Slayer, a podcast where we are
watching and discussing every episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, one by one,
spoiler free. I'm Jenny Owen-Youngs.
Kristin:​ And I'm Kristin Russo and this week, we are talking about Season 5,
Episode 5, there's no place like home, there's no place like home, there's no place
like home. Except the title's just, No Place Like Home. Stay tuned at the end of this
podcast every week for an original song written by Jenny, recapping the Buffy
episode we are discussing. And if you haven't yet started listening to our Angel
podcast, Angel On Top, it's hosted by Brittany Ashley and Laura Zak. And you really
should be listening to it, in my opinion.
Jenny:​ And in my opinion. No Place Like Home was written by Doug Petrie, directed
by David Solomon and originally aired on October 24, 2000.
Kristin:​ This is the one where Buffy learns more about Dawn after she discovers a
mysterious orb linked to a group of monks being pursued by an incredibly powerful
force. [laughs] That's…
Jenny:​ Whoa…
Kristin:​ The IMDB description. This is the one where we learn that Dawn is the
motherfucking Key.


Jenny:​ Yes. We. Do.
Kristin:​ So right out of the gates, Jenny, I wanna know why this one monk of the
three does his hair by putting an actual bowl over his head and cutting it. You know
what I mean? You know what I'm talking about, the blond monk?
Jenny:​ I mean, it's traditional monk styling. [Kristin laughs] Gotta keep the hair
out of your eyes so you can, you know, genuflect and intone.
Kristin:​ Sure. Sure, sure, sure.
Jenny:​ In an unencumbered fashion. I wanna know if the monks are subletting this
place from Angel. Because there are candles ​everywhere.​
Kristin:​ [laughs] Well, candles make a lot more sense for monks than they do for
ensouled or not-souled vampires.
Jenny:​ Yeah, but like, how many people in Sunnydale you think have a candle
collection that big? That extensive?
Kristin:​ [laughs] Yeah. Only one.
Jenny:​ I think Angel left them behind when he relocated.
Kristin:​ [laughs] So the monks are like—what is this, two months ago? And they're
forming the Key. Right, you know, they're—everybody on the set of Buffy the
Vampire Slayer is getting ready for a new season two months ago. And two months
ago, these monks were sitting in this room, trying to protect their Key—
Jenny:​ Yes. Chanting intensifies, while something bangs away at a barred door
during this little ceremony that they're doing.
Kristin:​ And then we cut, to Buffy fighting a vampire, as she does. We learn—
Jenny:​ Yeah, it's—it was just Halloween in real life, and it's about to be Halloween
in the timeline of the—just when this episode was airing. Buffy is definitely fighting
a vampire who's trick-or-treating as Stone Cold Steve Austin. [Kristin laughs] And
she's wearing a fluffy, fluffy fur coat.
Kristin:​ She is, it's so fluffy. It's so unlike every other leather coat we've ever seen
her in. So maybe she's a little festive for the season as well.
Jenny:​ Ooh!


Kristin:​ We also learn that she always wanted piano lessons. One of her quips is,
you know, "well, I always wanted piano lessons." And I just thought, well, that
would be nice. You know? If Joyce and—and husband—ex-husband of Joyce had
given Buffy some piano lessons, like, that would have been—
Jenny:​ Well, she was so busy with ice skating.
Kristin:​ That's true, she did love those Ice Capades. And the movies. Wow, she
really does love ice skating, doesn't she?
Jenny:​ Yeah, it's a whole thing. And those lessons aren't cheap either, I imagine.
Kristin:​ It's true. And this is—like, I know this is just a quip and I know I'm just
having a good time with it. [Jenny laughs] But it also kind of ties into one of the
bigger themes of the episode, which is that Dawn is getting—and the season, really,
to date. That Dawn is getting all of these fun bonding things with Joyce. She's
getting to be a little kid, she's getting to enjoy stuff. Meanwhile, Buffy is—instead of
playing her piano solo at the recital, she is killing vampires in an alleyway. She did
not get the full childhood that she wished that she could have gotten.
Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ If she had, perhaps she would have gone to the rave last night that was at
this factory. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Yes, but alas, the rave is no longer here. That was a rave of yesterday. And
this is an abandoned building of now. And—
Kristin:​ Yeah, so—
Jenny:​ [laughs] This security guard, uh, doesn't understand this generation of
Buffys and tells her "don't forget your glowing orb" as she leaves.
Kristin:​ Did you ever go to a rave, Jenny?
Jenny:​ Oh my god, no!
Kristin:​ [laughs] I mean, I did.
Jenny:​ No, I know, but if you had asked me as a teenager if I had ever gone to a
rave, I would have answered like, [dejectedly] "no… "


Kristin:​ [laughs] "No one ever invited me to a rave."
Jenny:​ "What's a rave like?"
Kristin:​ I went to a rave but it was just once. And I'm not sure—like, it was
called—it was a rave, but it doesn't seem as rave-y as some of the raves I've heard
about now. You know, people who also went to raves regularly. I'm like, I don't—I
wasn't out until 8 in the morning at my rave, so it feels like maybe I didn't really,
fully—
Jenny:​ You weren't doing it right!
Kristin:​ Right, exactly. It was one rave, it was my first one. I went, there were
glow sticks. And some other stuff, and I left at a reasonable, you know, 2, 3, 4 AM
hour.
Jenny:​ They at least made the bare minimum for qualification.
Kristin:​ I did, I got to check it off on my list, you know? [Jenny chuckles] So after
she gets handed this glow ball, which we learn later in the episode is the Dagon
Sphere.
Jenny:​ Hell yeah.
Kristin:​ Not to be confused with the—I'm sorry, Jenny, but the Orb of fucking
Thesulah and the fucking Dagon Sphere, like—
Jenny:​ First cousins.
Kristin:​ You put those two orbs next to each other—
Jenny:​ They are first cousin glowing orbs.
Kristin:​ [laughs] So we cut to the credits. So Jenny, something I know about you is
that you are a big fan of breakfast food. You love to make pancakes, you love to
make all manor of wonderful breakfasts. So I just—
Jenny:​ Oh, yeah.
Kristin:​ I thought that this was a great-looking French toast, but I feel like you're
the one to really assess it.
Jenny:​ So. I was so full of rage, watching this scene—


Kristin:​ [laughing] Oh no!
Jenny:​ That I completely failed to take appropriate notice of the French toast. And
for that, I am sorry.
Kristin:​ No, I mean, while we've opened another door, why were you so full of
rage?
Jenny:​ Just Dawn. Dawn's making me ​crazy i​ n this scene. [audibly shudders]
Kristin:​ God. Do you think—
Jenny:​ Fiddling with the flowers, knocking over the vase.
Kristin:​ Write me a script—or whatever you wanna call it. Write me something
where Dawn is actually not Dawn, she's Bella. And the little sister of Buffy is
actually Bella Swan.
Jenny:​ [laughing] [ditsy voice] Oh my god, she's so clumsy. Oh my god, and she
just ​loves v
​ ampires.
Kristin:​ [simultaneously, ditsy voice] She's so clumsy! She's just always dropping
vases.
Jenny:​ Yo, I… let's see if I can do this without spoiling. On Halloween, I went to see
a live performance of an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
Kristin:​ Uh-huh?
Jenny:​ And there were, as you would expect, a bunch of human beings playing the
various characters.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Uh-huh.
Jenny:​ But then when Dawn entered the stage, it was revealed that Dawn was just
played by a plush hand puppet of a little girl. [Kristin laughs] Which felt… very
satisfying and appropriate and I wanted to let everybody know.
Kristin:​ Yeah. So you're angry at Dawn, so angry! All she did was knock over a
damn vase.


Jenny:​ Ugh. Yeah, well, it's all she does all episode is knock shit over! Watch your
elbows. Although, you know, I'm very clumsy so maybe I'm just projecting my own
disappointment in myself onto Dawn. It's possible.
Kristin:​ Ohh. Well, Joyce comes in and Dawn does take credit for everything
basically that Buffy has—
Jenny:​ Oh my god, and it makes me so mad!
Kristin:​ [laughing] Just done. But she's—we learn that Joyce is having more
headaches. And also that she calls Dawn "pumpkin belly." So.
Jenny:​ Oh god!
Kristin:​ I don't really like that as a nickname—
Jenny:​ Yeah, I ​hate t​ hat.
Kristin:​ But that's fine, it's not my nickname.
Jenny:​ Get it outta here! Yeah, okay.
Kristin:​ [laughs] And this is—you know, again, not to—we don't have to hit every
one of these moments, but Buffy is like, "did I have any nicknames when I was a
kid?" And Joyce is like, "no, you were just Buffy." And then we learn that in the
absence of Pat, Dawn has been going to book club.
Jenny:​ [laughs] I think Dawn and Joyce have a private book club.
Kristin:​ Yeah, no, I do too. I just couldn't say "book club" without saying Pat.
Jenny:​ [simultaneously] Like, what are they reading, Sweet Valley High? Is Joyce
reading Sweet Valley High with Dawn?
Kristin:​ Oh my god, or maybe Sweet Valley Twins. I think—
Jenny:​ Oh my god. Are they the younger ones?
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ What happens in Sweet Valley?


Kristin:​ Yeah. Sweet Valley High was the main one, and then Sweet Valley Twins,
they were a little bit younger. And I actually read a lot of Sweet Valley Twins. But I
think that Dawn would be reading the Twins and not the High. There was one where
one of the twins got her period and I was fascinated with it. I was fascinated with
any book that anyone got their period in, 'cause apparently, nobody was telling me
anything that I needed to know.
Jenny:​ [laughs] Just gathering information wherever you could find it.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Yeah, I was like, Are You There God, It's Me Margaret, that Sweet
Valley Twins book. There's probably a Babysitters Club that has a period in it, but I
actually don't remember that as much as the other two.
Jenny:​ Oh my word.
Kristin:​ Anyway!
Jenny:​ Speaking of new beginnings.
Kristin:​ Oh my god, okay, so. This next scene is… [Jenny laughs] I mean… it's one
of the most epic scenes in the whole series, if you ask me, personally. Do you agree
with this, Jenny?
Jenny:​ It's quite special.
Kristin:​ So if you don't know what we're talking about, it's the scene where Buffy
enters the magic shop, it's grand opening day. And Giles is standing there, in his
wizard hat and his wizard cape. But I counted—okay, so. The scene—the scene
actually starts before this 6 minute and 41 second mark. But at 6 minutes and 41
seconds is when Buffy first sees Giles, okay.
Jenny:​ Ha!
Kristin:​ It is silent from 6:41 to 6:55. It's 14 ​complete s
​ econds of silence—
Jenny:​ Oh my god.
Kristin:​ And six cuts back and forth. Buffy's face, then we see Giles for the first
time, then we see Buffy's face.
Jenny:​ Oh my god.
Kristin:​ And it does that six times. It is ​fucking h
​ ilarious and incre—


Jenny:​ Incredible.
Kristin:​ Whoever edited this shit deserves a standing ovation.
Jenny:​ Yeah. Yeah, it's really… really something.
Kristin:​ [laughing] It's so special! And I mean, we can't go any further, I don't
think, without playing Giles' jingle.
Jenny:​ Sure, sure, sure.
[GILES jingle plays]
Giles! Hot dad!
When you were younger you were real bad
But now you're older, you got glasses
That help you watch over us!
Thank you, Giles!
Kristin:​ I don't know if he's quite a hot dad in his, um, wizard costume. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Not what I would say, but then he takes it off. So—reverting back to regular
hot dad form. And, you know, he's kinda, I think, stressing out a little bit but trying
to be cool on top—on the surface?
Kristin:​ Mm-hmm, of course.
Jenny:​ About the fact that there are no customers. Yet. And—
Kristin:​ Yeah, do you think he did enough signage outside? 'Cause I feel like Giles
is the kind of guy who probably focused so much on the detailia [sic] of like, the
store itself being perfect that perhaps he forgot to put up grand opening balloons.
Jenny:​ Yeah. You know what I'm concerned about? He's the sole proprietor of this
business and has no employees. [Kristin laughs] He's just like, "hey teens that I
hang out with, come do free labor for me all day."
Kristin:​ Yeah, it is curious that he decided to hire no one. [laughs] Zero people.
Jenny:​ [laughs] Yeah. Yeah, oh yeah. I like when Buffy says, "You'll be making
money hand over fist" and then kinda puts her hand over her fist and tries to figure
out, like, what is the origin of this colloquialism?


Kristin:​ Do you know? Do you know what the origin is?
Jenny:​ No, did you look it up? I should have looked it up.
Kristin:​ I did. So I would like for you to guess first what the origin is of "hand over
fist."
Jenny:​ I always just pictured it as, like, oh, you're making so much money that
you're reaching and grabbing some and then as you're pulling that money back with
your fist, you're reaching your open hand towards more money that you're then
grabbing. And it just is a cycle of grabbing money and your hand—your open hand
reaching for the money passing over your fist, clutching the money you've already
obtained. And then there's a little girl, selling matches. [both laugh] And then she
dies!
Kristin:​ [simultaneously] And she has a penny.
Jenny:​ [laughing] Yeah, she has two pennies, actually.
Kristin:​ Two.
Jenny:​ And then there's three bears.
Kristin:​ [laughs] And Little Red Riding Rood is there.
Jenny:​ Uh-huh.
Kristin:​ So… you're actually—I mean, your imagery is pretty spot-on. But it has
nautical origins, Jenny.
Jenny:​ Ooh!
Kristin:​ It originated from the speed at which you would pull the rope on a boat.
Jenny:​ Hell yeah. Woo!
Kristin:​ So same gesture, right? That same thing that you were saying—
Jenny:​ Yep.
Kristin:​ But instead of money, it was a rope. And it actually originated in the
1800s, meaning a steady pace. Like, you would steadily kind of like, hand over
fist—


Jenny:​ Ahh. Right, right, right.
Kristin:​ Or hand over hand, but then by the 1900s, that meaning sort of changed
to be fast. Quickly, hand over fist.
Jenny:​ Right, right, right, right.
Kristin:​ So yeah. So you were not far off. It's just that instead of money—
Jenny:​ Oh, yes.
Kristin:​ It was a rope.
Jenny:​ Isn't all money kind of a rope? At the end of the day.
Kristin:​ Great… transition. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Anyway. Don't think too hard about that. I love—so Buffy—just like, quick
aside, Buffy's worried about Joyce and she tells Giles, whatever. I'm concerned, but
I'm way more concerned about the fact that Willow dragged Riley down to the
magic shop so that he could also see Giles in his wizard cloak.
Kristin:​ Yes! [both laugh] It's really cute. It's really cute. It's also, like, so
amazing, the opposite personalities we have in Willow and Buffy, that we just had
this whole scene where Buffy was literally staring death daggers at his costume.
[laughing] Meanwhile, Willow is like, more excited than she's been about anything
else in her life.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Also, why is she not bringing Tara? You know what I mean? Tara's the one
who would love this fucking hat.
Jenny:​ I… don't know. I think Riley's got space in his heart for Giles looking goofy.
Kristin:​ That's true. One quick thing before we move forward with this scene. I
know it's not the pivotal in the episode, but Dawn—so when Buffy comes in, Dawn
runs in after her and is like, "You thought you could lose me but you were wrong!"
And I'm just like, okay, hold up, back up for a second—
Jenny:​ [laughs] There's like one street in Sunnydale.


Kristin:​ Yeah, and what did Buffy do? Did Buffy leave with Dawn and just run as
fast as she could, hoping Dawn wouldn't catch up?
Jenny:​ I mean… yeah, it's—
Kristin:​ Anyway, it was just a thing that I noted that I wanted to ask you about.
Also, Dawn has a really hilarious moment where she's like, "oh, there's all these
talismen. Talis-dudes? Talis-guys?" She's like, trying to be—
Jenny:​ Talis-fellas. Yeah, what's the plural of talisman?
Kristin:​ Talis—I think talis-dudes is what I would vote for.
Jenny:​ Yeah, I'm feeling that.
Kristin:​ Then Buffy's like, "yo, there's this fucking orb." And Giles is like, "it's gotta
be paranormal because it's so shiny." Which I think is pretty accurate. [both laugh]
Jenny:​ Yeah, I mean, some of the more reasonable reasoning we've heard on this
show up to this point.
Kristin:​ Right, and then Dawn opens her big mouth.
Jenny:​ Oh, no!
Kristin:​ And she really blows it for Buffy when she's like, "yo, Buffy doesn't even
want you to go on patrol. She says you can't do anything, basically. You're really
cute and kitteny."
Jenny:​ Ugh.
Kristin:​ And Riley goes from being embarrassed to like, so embarassed, and has to
leave the room because this is the worst. And Dawn's clueless, she has no idea that
she's upset him.
Jenny:​ Yeah, I mean—and this is tough. But I feel like it's gotta be extra irritating
to get dealt a blow like this via Dawn.
Kristin:​ Yes.
Jenny:​ Ugh!


Kristin:​ Because also it's like, not only do you know that your girlfriend is talking
about your weakness, but she's talking to her little sister who she doesn't even like
about your weakness.
Jenny:​ Or at least in front of your little sister.
Kristin:​ So Riley's like, "yo, I gotta get outta here. Is the danger room open?"
What? [laughs]
Jenny:​ Danger room, it's like a… you know. Let's actually look up the origin of that,
because I think it's just a—oh! You know what it is, it's the X-Men.
Kristin:​ Ohh!
Jenny:​ So… the X-Men in Charles Xavier's compound, where he's educating young
mutants and also running the X-Men. They have something called the danger room,
which is like, sort of a combat training simulator that can kind of come up with
anything. Sentinels, Magneto, whatever, so you can train.
Kristin:​ Oh. So he's talking about the training room, but he's being cool about it.
Jenny:​ Yes, I would say that by talking about the X-Men, he is being cool about it.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Well, some might say nerdy but here—
Jenny:​ I genuinely believe that, but I wanna make it open to other people to not
feel like that. [Kristin laughs] The X-Men rock.
Kristin:​ Really quickly, I just wanna pull out some terminology here that I assume
a lot of you already know is pretty ableist and inappropriate that's said in this
scene. But just in case you don't, Willow says—so Willow is basically saying to
Buffy, 'cause Buffy is as furious as Jenny is at Dawn. [laughs] Buffy is that mad.
And Willow says, "go easy on her, she's a spaz just like me."
Jenny:​ Ahh…
Kristin:​ Yeah, no, Willow—Willow is talking about how, like, quirky and clumsy and
what have you. But spaz is a word rooted in spastic. It's, you know, a word that's
rooted in disability and so it's not a great word. But in the 90s, guess what? We all
said it and a lot of people still say it now. So just in case you didn't know, that word
is not cool.
Jenny:​ Yeah, that's a word you could stop saying, if you are saying it.


Kristin:​ Yeah. Buffy wants to know why she can't be a lil' pumpkin belly.
Jenny:​ Ugh, who wants to be… I don't even wanna say that phrase. But who wants
to be that?
Kristin:​ Say it, Jenny, say it! Say it!
Jenny:​ Who wants to be a lil' pumpkin belly? [gags]
Kristin:​ Nice. [laughs]
Jenny:​ It's so gross. [laughing] Then Buffy's like, "Why can I ever be a lil' pumpkin
belly?" and Willow's like, "Well, I don't feel qualified to address that part of your
question."
Kristin:​ [simultaneously, laughing] Right, I can't speak to that. [both laugh]
Jenny:​ And then Dawn breaks some more shit in the magic shop. Ahh!
Kristin:​ Wow. Your—I'm surprised actually, Jenny. I didn't think your Dawn
disdain… your Dawn'sdain would pick up so quickly.
Jenny:​ This episode is particularly egregious. Or the beginning of this episode is
very frustrating. Okay. Then. Joyce is laid up with a headache, she's not feeling so
great. Buffy's like, "let me go get your scrip' at the hospital pharmacy." Then it's
like, "hi, Ben," and now I have to tell you something.
Kristin:​ Oh boy.
Jenny:​ You and everyone who's listening.
Kristin:​ Oh boy.
Jenny:​ Are you prepared?
Kristin:​ I'm ready.
Jenny:​ I was recently watching the music video for the Puddle of Mudd song, She
Hates Me. It doesn't matter why!
Kristin:​ [laughing] I'm sorry—


Jenny:​ It's none of your goddamn business!
Kristin:​ I just—sorry. I'm gonna let you jump off this launch pad in a second, but I
just wanna let you know that as somebody who doesn't know what you've been
watching lately, that my updates have been— [Jenny laughs] in chronological
order: Eyes Wide Shut—
Jenny:​ Hell yeah.
Kristin:​ A live taping of—a live performance of a Buffy episode and this music
video. So I just wanna say—
Jenny:​ That's right.
Kristin:​ Your taste is incredibly eclectic.
Jenny:​ Well, I'm a—I have many facets. I am—I contain multitudes.
Kristin:​ [laughing] Okay, so you're watching puddles of mud, whatever.
Jenny:​ Puddle of Mudd, with two D's. And the song is She Hates Me, do you know
that song?
Kristin:​ Um, sing a little bit of it?
Jenny:​ It's like—you're gonna know it as soon as I sing it. It's like, [singing] "She
fucking hates me. [Kristin laughs] La la la la! She fucking hates me."
Kristin:​ Yes, I do, I do.
Jenny:​ [singing] Hmm-hmm-hmm!
Kristin:​ Suddenly, I can see both of those D's at the end of Mudd very clearly.
Jenny:​ Exactly. Exactly! Exactly. And the band kinda looks like four dudes from
American Gladiators borrowed the wardrobe of, like… Hinder. And—they just have
long, flowing hair and they make really strong eye contact with the camera and
they're like, "La la la la!" [Kristin laughs] Okay, so. First of all, I was first shocked
to learn that the girl—the one girl who fucking hates you in this music video is
played by none other than Lyla fucking Garrity.
Kristin:​ Ooh!


Jenny:​ Minka Kelly is just there on the bed with her stuffed animals, singing into
her corded phone.
Kristin:​ Wow.
Jenny:​ Okay, but that's not why we're here today, talking about Puddle of Mudd.
Kristin:​ I'm always here for Lyla Garrity.
Jenny:​ The premise of this video… is that there's a bunch of people in high school
and also working in a food service—a variety of food service jobs, like, a counter
guy and then there's a gentleman washing dishes, running the dish zone in the
back of a restaurant. And I'm pretty fucking sure that that young gentleman—I
would recognize those soft pouty lips and that feathered hair just about anywhere.
I'm pretty sure it's fucking Charlie Weber who plays Ben. And—however. However.
If this is accurate… if this is accurate, the credit has been scrubbed from the
internet.
Kristin:​ Oh!
Jenny:​ So if anyone can confirm or deny for me that that's Charlie Weber in the
music video of She Hates Me by Puddle of Mudd—
Kristin:​ Wow.
Jenny:​ Please write in and let us know, thank you.
Kristin:​ Incredible. I was—before you said you couldn't find it, I was like, I cannot
believe you are telling us this entire story and you didn't look up to confirm
[laughs] if it was Charlie—if it was him. So now it all makes sense. Please let us
know. Wow, Jenny.
Jenny:​ Thank you.
Kristin:​ Wow.
Jenny:​ What else? What's next?
Kristin:​ What a ride. What a ride. Love—
Jenny:​ That's all I have to say about this episode. [both laugh]


Kristin:​ So, okay. Well, I have a jingle to play for Ben right out of the gates here.
He calls himself—he says, "you can refer to me as Man Nurse." Which could get this
jingle, but I'm actually gonna give the jingle for the next thing he says, which is
when Buffy sort of pins this, you know, patient—which we will learn is the security
guard from before—down to the bed. He says something like, "I don't mean to…
[laughs] sexually harrass you in the workplace—"
Jenny:​ "Not to be rampantly sexist in the workplace, but… "
Kristin:​ In the workplace, right. "But you've got some serious muscles for a girl."
[THE PATRIARCHY jingle plays]
The patriarchy! [thunder clap, evil laughter]
Jenny:​ Here's the thing. I think that what— [laughs] am I just always gonna be the
devil's advocate of this podcast? I feel like—
Kristin:​ You're gonna devil's advocate The Patriarchy jingle on "you've got serious
muscles for a girl"?
Jenny:​ Uh, he is very self aware that what he's saying could be interpreted as
rampantly sexist. But he has just witnessed a feat of great strength—there are
multiple people trying to hold this guy down. And Buffy one-arms it.
Kristin:​ Yeah. And he could say, "you've got some serious muscles."
Jenny:​ [simultaneously] That's like—that's not just about her being a girl, that's
just like, "goddamn."
Kristin:​ Right. Well, that's what I'm saying.
Jenny:​ Okay, sure.
Kristin:​ The thing that gave it the jingle was the "for a girl," not that he recognized
that she had super stre—I mean, that, yes, of course.
Jenny:​ Okay.
Kristin:​ Goodness gracious! Sometimes I wonder, what are we even doing here?
So… [both laugh] So she's like—he's like, "oh, it's a radioactive spider bite?" And
she's like, "something like that," which is cute.
Jenny:​ Yeah, I like that. Just a little more comics stuff, little more Marvel.


Kristin:​ Right. And then we get this moment with the security guard, where she's
like, "I know this guy. Like, I just saw him and he was not talking the way that he's
talking right now." And he looks at her and looks at the meds that she's holding and
is like, "Those don't help." And then he's like, "they come through the family,
they're gonna come after your family, they're blah blah blah." And she's like, fuck! I
think she drops the pills, right?
Jenny:​ Yes.
Kristin:​ Okay, so, Buffy's like, "yo, I know what this is about, I've done five
seasons of this television show, and my mom isn't sick. She's being fucked with by
a demon of some kind." She runs off. And then… we get to a very important scene.
Jenny:​ There's a big metal door.
Kristin:​ There sure is.
Jenny:​ Three monks have become one. [Kristin laughs] Just like in the Spice Girls
song.
Kristin:​ Exactly what I thought of, the minute you said it. Uh, yes—
Jenny:​ And something scary is bang, bang, banging away at that big metal door.
Kristin:​ It's true. As a matter of fact—
Jenny:​ What do you think happened between two months ago and right now? How
many doors has that thing kicked down?
Kristin:​ I don't know, and that's what I was wondering, because the door of the
front of the place is intact. So I'm just curious, did the Beast fall from the sky like
Angel fell from hell that one time?
Jenny:​ Ohh.
Kristin:​ And was she wearing the red dress already? Did she put it on the back
room?
Jenny:​ Hmm.
Kristin:​ Because she's obviously not come through the whole building like that. So
I'm not sure, but alas. The door busts down. And it's a pretty epic—I mean, this is a


pretty fucking rad thing, because—obviously played for her size. The door's
monstrous and made of metal, and when it falls down it's this huge cloud of dust.
And the silhouette that we see is miniature, right? It's like, literally the size of
Buffy. This Beast and Buffy are matched, they're exactly the same size. They're not
matched in strength, which we'll find out in a few scenes.
Jenny:​ Yeah, yeah.
Kristin:​ But she then—the camera focuses in, and she has on a beautiful red dress,
lipstick that matches. Faith would be stoked on this choice of fucking lipstick. If you
have thoughts on what the shade is called, please write in to us at
bufferingthevampireslayer@gmail.com. And her hair. Is just. Glorious! I think,
wouldn't you say?
Jenny:​ Yes, I would agree, mm-hmm.
Kristin:​ And she says, "I've been looking all over for you" and we cut. And we cut
to the Magic Box, where Giles is making his first sale.
Jenny:​ What!
Kristin:​ He's so excited. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Yeah, he's positively giddy. Until Anya trounces in. Loudly proclaiming that
the conjuring powder is grotesquely overpriced.
Kristin:​ Uh, yeah. And not only does Anya have some complaints about the
conjuring powder prices—because I'm sure that all of you listening thought, we're
gonna hear from Kate Leth, and we're gonna hear from Kate Leth as soon as this
red dress and red lipstick appear. And I thought so too, listener. However, I had to
give it another beat, because then Anya showed up wearing this leopard dress.
Jenny: ​Ha!
Kristin:​ And I texted—Jenny, I texted Kate about this leopard dress. And she
immediately texted me back the name of this dress. I had no idea what she was
talking about—
Jenny:​ Ha!
Kristin:​ And I was like, alright, alright, alright, save it for the podcast. So can we,
may we, please, go to Kate Leth.


[Jenny singing Fashion Watch intro theme]
It's time for our friend Kate
To give you the Buffy fashion update!
Kate:​ [sound of cat purring throughout clip] Well, hello, hello indeed, and welcome
back to Buffy Fashion Watch. I usually have to watch out for the planes going by in
the background when I'm recording, but today, you might hear some kitty purrs.
Because Ray, one of my adorable little cats, has decided to curl up right next to the
microphone and absolutely refuses to leave. So um, she's a part of this as much as
you or I.
Alright, so with that covered and as Ray tries to devour my hand, let's talk about
the incredible fashion in an episode where Giles wearing a wizard costume and hat
is actually maybe not the standout look from the episode. I don't know, there's
definitely some competition. Because not only did we have the Beast, the unnamed
figure of great power and fashion, who shows up in an incredible form-fitting red
dress and heels that, well, don't actually work out for her. [laughs] We've also got
Anya in a leopard-print cheongsam.
It was very funny because Kristin texted me a screencap of Anya's dress in the
Magic Box and I immediately wrote back, "oh my god, is that a leopard-print
cheongsam?" And Kristin was like, "what?" [laughs] It's a very particular kind of
dress. It's Chinese, it's a traditional look. It's also called a qipao and they were very
big in the 90s before, uh, mainstream folks, I think, had any concept of cultural
appropriation. They were everywhere, and you might feel a little strange if you saw
them now. But at the time, real big. And honestly, the leopard print… it's really
working for Anya.
Now I might be biased because I'm literally wearing two leopard-print items right
now, [laughing] both a turtleneck with puffy sleeves—sorry that I keep laughing,
this cat is licking my hand the entire time that I'm talking. But also, some
leopard-print sandals that would not be out of place in this episode. But we've also
got some really great looks from Buffy. You know, I'm a big fan of the t-shirt with
the sparkly devil on it, it does remind me of that cat sticker I talked about many,
many episodes ago now. [laughing] God, she is still licking my hand. This is many
takes later, by the way, so I'm just rolling with it at this point. But I also really,
really love her look from the beginning of the episode, where she has that necklace
that's kind of almost designed like a tie, where it's got that clip in the middle and
bits hanging down and then she also has that sort of gold tassely belt thing
happening. There's a lot of midriff, lot of hint of midriff happening.
Also, another rare shout out to Xander. That, you know, kind of slightly V-necked
red sweater is really working for him. Like, he looks good in this episode. He walked


into the Magic Box and I thought, damn. Is that Xander? Alright, cool, whatever,
let's look at Anya again so I don't feel weird about it. And then we did, and
everything was fine. Now, I'm not ignoring Willow's adorable daisy sweater, it's
very cute. I also really like that lavender denim jacket with the matchy dangly
earrings that she's got going on. I'm currently rocking kind of a short bob myself
and that thing where the earrings sort of hang below the line of the bob is just—it's
so classy. I feel like Ms. Fisher every time, even if I sort of just look like hot trash,
but you know. It's a good inspiration and Willow is definitely pulling it off.
And, you know, Dawn kind of doesn't get a lot of fashion highlights in this show
because she's 15 and they're dressing her like she's 15. And being 15 in the early
2000s was a nightmare where fashion was concerned. But I will say that that
patchwork denim jacket that she has? My friend Ellen wore to a
dress-as-your-high-school-self party once when I was, I think, 22, and I wanted it
so much that she gave it to me. And I'm pretty sure I still have it, so you know.
Dawn's getting one thing right.
And with that said, I will leave you to the rest of your episode. And until next time,
I'll see you at the mall.
[Jenny singing Fashion Watch outro theme]
That was our friend Kate
She gave you the Buffy fashion update!
Kristin:​ Oh my goodness. So…
Jenny:​ Incred… bless. Praise.
Kristin:​ Can you even—just a casual—it was just a casual day over here. I sent
Kate a text message and she comes back with some hot terminology. She literally
was like, "Did I come out too hot with my fashion nerd?" And I'm like, no, never,
Kate. Never.
Jenny:​ [laughs] No such thing.
Kristin:​ No. So… thank you, Kate.
Jenny:​ Okay, so. Anya, in this dress, is feeling bitter because she's never had to
afford things before. Which further continues to raise this question for me: what is
the economy of vengeance demons like? Does D'Hoffryn pay them a stipend? Do
they just—it's not like they can create money, for example. Or can they? Can they
just—


Kristin:​ I'm sure they can.
Jenny:​ Hmm, okay, so individual vengeance demons are just—
Kristin:​ [simultaneously] Probably the crash of 2008 is because the demons made
too much money, you know?
Jenny:​ [amused] Okay, okay.
Kristin:​ But no, I was fully—I thought we were running with the severance package
being the canon of what has happened here. 'Cause I—literally my note—
Jenny:​ No, yes, yes, yes. Yes, that, but for the thousand years that she was a
vengeance demon, why didn't she have to afford things? Was it because she could
create her own money or what?
Kristin:​ I wonder if demons—so we've talked a lot already on the podcast about,
you know, they have their own salon, they have their own bar at Willy's. They've
got their own heating and cooling systems. They've got the whole underground
thing. So I wonder—'cause you bring up, I think, a good point, Jenny, which is—you
know, we use the dollar. I was recently in France and was using euros. You travel
to other place—there's internet money now. So do demons—
Jenny:​ Sure, sure. I recently bought some bitcoin.
Kristin:​ You bought s—okay. Listen. You can't just throw that on me. [both laugh]
Jenny:​ Sorry!
Kristin:​ You can't just fucking throw "I bought some bitcoin"—
Jenny:​ [simultaneously] There I was, watching the Puddle of Mudd music video for
She Hates Me—
Kristin:​ What is happening to you!?
Jenny:​ While buying some bitcoin. [both laugh]
Kristin:​ Somebody save Jenny. [both laugh] She's sitting in her room watching
Puddles of Mudd videos, buying bitcoin.
Jenny:​ Oh my god, ​Puddle.​ Singular puddle. [Kristin laughs] Singular puddle, two
D's on the Mudd.


Kristin:​ Okay, I'm so sorry. Wow. I'm—the whole episode is thrown because I'm
only gonna be thinking about the fact that you own bitcoin for the rest of today.
[Jenny laughs] But I wonder if demons have their own currency. Right?
Jenny:​ Yeah—oh, that's a really interesting question.
Kristin:​ And you know what I think—
Jenny:​ Or like, barter—do they rely more heavily on barter, I wonder.
Kristin:​ Right. But I do think that we know one thing, Jenny, and that's that you
and I just did some serious…
[HELLMATH jingle plays]
Hellmath!
Kristin:​ Okay, so, Buffy's like "yo, remember that fucking orb? I think my mom is
sick because of it." And there's this really great little comedy moment where Anya,
Giles and Willow all take one giant step back from the orb. [both laugh] Buffy's like,
"no, no, it's not gonna hurt us. But it's making her sick." And they're like, "what are
you gonna do about it?" And she's like, "I'm gonna find them, I'm gonna hunt
them, and I'm gonna kill them." Which reminded me, Jenny, a bit, of "want, take
have." I feel like she's taking a page out of that book.
Jenny:​ Oh my god.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ Yeah, I think that Faith is one of the great early pioneers of saying things in
threes.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Yeah, with all that "five by five" she should—
Jenny:​ Stating her triplicate intentions.
Kristin:​ Her phrase should have been "three by three," you know what I mean?
Jenny:​ [laughs] Yes.
Kristin:​ So the Beast—we cut to the Beast in the warehouse, who is monologuing
about how much she hates the mortal coil. [laughing] She could crap a better
existence than this one.


Jenny:​ Gross. Uncalled for.
Kristin:​ She says, Jenny, that she's been told she has boundary issues. Which
made me laugh so hard, because I was like, does she go to therapy? Like, where—
who has told her that she has boundary issues? Is it a previous relationship of hers?
Jenny:​ Ooh! Good question.
Kristin:​ You know, I just wanna—right?
Jenny:​ I wanna know too, yeah.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ Who's she even interacting with besides… these guys?
Kristin:​ I know. I mean, I guess we don't—I guess we don't know. But I guess also
we find out that she does have actual physical boundary issues, just moments later
when she puts both of her hands inside of the head of the other security guard.
Jenny:​ Gross, gross. Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross.
Kristin:​ So perhaps it was just one of these other people that she's brain-sucked
who said, "excuse me, ma'am?"
Jenny:​ "Excuse me, ma'am."
Kristin:​ "Uh, you seem to have some boundary issues." So she's pissed because
this monk won't tell her where the Key is.
Jenny:​ She wants that Key! She wants that Key and she's all sweaty about it!
[both laugh] Ooh!
Kristin:​ [laughs] I think you might have just become eligible for one of our Sexual
Tension Award nominations, without knowing it.
Jenny:​ Yeah, it's definitely the most anybody gets sweaty about anything in this
episode. There's not a lot of sexual tension to be found, so I'll take it where we find
it.
Kristin:​ Right. There's also a moment—a very… commentary about the worst parts
about America, I think? Where she's like—the monk says something in his language


and she says—she replies half back in his language and then she's like, "This is the
new world, speak American!" Which is obviously a dig on—
Jenny:​ Gross!
Kristin:​ Yeah. On all of the people that still exist today, unfortunately, in the same
and even more dangerous ways. [sarcastically] Cool! Moving along.
Jenny:​ Okay. So. In go the fingers, and then—
Kristin:​ [laughs] Gross, Jenny!
Jenny:​ [laughs] And then we cut over—
Kristin:​ So that is what she said.
Jenny:​ [laughs] She said that, she is me. Let me live. The Magic Box is overrun!
Giles is in a pa—
Kristin:​ Wait. Wait.
Jenny:​ What?
Kristin:​ Wait, wait.
Jenny:​ What?
Kristin:​ Wait. Two really big things happen in the scene before this. Before we go
to the Magic Box. One is—well, first of all, the Beast delivers a monologue in her
meltdown state that is incredible, which I personally would love to play, if that's
alright with you, Jenny.
Jenny:​ Go for it.
[Clip from episode plays]
The Beast:​ I bet this is fun for you, isn't it? Say it. You like to torture me.
Why? You don't even own the damn thing and I want it, I need it, and I've
gotta have it now and you keep refusing to tell me where the Key is! And it's
typical! It's typical, it's typical, the whole mortal meatsack comes complete
with stink and bile, sweat and protein. Yes, I said humans! Not now,
Mommy's talking! Wriggling, piling, prowling, crawling, clowning, cavorting,


doing it over and over and over and over until someone's gonna sit down on
their tuffet and make this birthing stop! [man screams]
Kristin:​ Okay, so two things about this monologue. One, there's a really key thing
that she says, which is, "sit down… " Like, she says something about sitting down
on your tuffet. And this is the third time that we have heard reference to Little Miss
Muffet. Right?
Jenny:​ Yes. Yes!
Kristin:​ So, you know, it's just fun.
Jenny:​ Yes. [makes Psycho stab sound effect]
Kristin:​ It's like the polar bear in Lost, you know? We gotta keep track of it.
Jenny:​ Birds of a lipstick flock together, as I've always said.
Kristin:​ [laughs] And then the other thing is that the moment that I heard her say
"wriggling, piling, prowling, crawling" I asked Jenny if she might make a little
something for us. And she did.
Jenny:​ [whispers] And here it is.
[Jingle starts]
Wriggling, piling, prowling, crawling
And let's not forget cavorting
Kristin:​ So you're all welcome. For that gift.
Jenny:​ Yeah, the theme song we all just want to find other way—like, any excuse I
have to listen to that song in any form, I'm just like, please.
Kristin:​ Please, please, please.

aligners: Invisalign, SmileDirectClub, Candid. What better way to keep your fangs

aligner cleaner. They've sold over a million bottles. It kills bacteria, it freshens
breath, it whitens your fangs. It's the trifecta. You just pump the foam into your
trays, put them back into your mouth, and off you go. Because Eversmile
WhiteFoam is the first and only wearable aligner cleaner. There's no soaking or
rinsing required.

you put them into your mouth, and you wear them all day. Eversmile WhiteFoam
kills 99.999% of decay- and odor-causing bacteria within 60 seconds. The patented
hydrogen peroxide based formula also breaks up stain molecules, preventing
staining and lightly whitening your teeth over time. In short, Eversmile WhiteFoam

Jenny:​ Support for today's show comes from Native. Native is all about creating
safe, simple, effective products that people use every day. Native deodorant is
formulated without aluminium, parabens or talc, and with ingredients found in


nature like coconut oil, shea butter, tapioca starch. Their formula contains simple
ingredients you understand and comes in a wide variety of enticing scents. Plus
they release limited addition seasonal scents throughout the year. I personally am a
sucker for the general concept of limited addition seasonal scents, so this is very
exciting to me, and it will be exciting to you.
Making the switch to a natural deodorant does not mean having to sacrifice on odor
and wetness protection. Native is proof. There's a reason it has over 9,000 five-star
reviews. There's also no risk to try it. Native offers free shipping and free returns
and exchanges in the USA. I'll tell you what, I've been using Native deodorant for a
while and it's true. They have a wide variety of scents that all smell really good. But
as much as I love enticing scents, what's really important to me about deodorant is
that it is effective. And Native deodorant is. I also love that it's not chock-full of
aluminium and parabens and all of that stuff, that is a massive plus. And recently
I've switched over to the wild mint and spruce seasonal scent, and I cannot
recommend it enough. It rocks. It smells so good! If you wanna try it, you can get
20% off your first purchase. Just visit nativedeodorant.com and use promo code

[Ad music fades out]
Kristin:​ Alright, now we can get to your busy, busy Magic Box, Jenny.
Jenny:​ Okay! The Magic Box is ​full​. There are people everywhere. People want
things from Giles and he's all stressed out about it. Then in comes Xander in a red
sweater, looking… muscular?
Kristin:​ Mm!
Jenny:​ And tall. And like he's been hitting the gym. He looks great. His hair is at a
really good length.
Kristin:​ Wow, we're really going for a Xander detour, aren't we?
Jenny:​ Xander looks great in this episode and who knows how long it'll last? So
why not call it out while it's there to enjoy. [Kristin laughs] Meanwhile, Anya
finishes a transaction with a customer and says, "Please go."
Kristin:​ [laughing] "Please go!"
Jenny:​ And then Xander says, "hey, you know, why don't you try saying 'have a
nice day'?" And she says, "I have their money, who cares what kind of day they
have?" [Kristin laughs] Ah, the sweet days before we all felt the great weight of the


leaden boot of late-stage capitalism upon our necks and we could enjoy jokes like
this one.
Kristin:​ Ugh. Well and Xander is like, "it's a long cultural tradition of raging… "
um…
Jenny:​ Insincerity.
Kristin:​ [laughing] Insincerity! So then she tries—she tries to say have a nice day!
She's like, "hey, you! Have a nice day!" [laughs] And Jenny, something really
important I think is about to happen. It could have happened really at any point,
but this is the point in which, I think we should give Anya something that you made
for her.
Jenny:​ [gasps]
Kristin:​ Don't you?
Jenny:​ Anya, I made something for you. I hope you like it. Here it is. [Kristin
laughs]
[ANYA jingle plays]
[cash register rings]
She spent one millennium, demonically vengeancin'
Speaks her mind and then some, you know
She's partial to the finer things and down with double boyfriends, oh yeah
Exchanging cash for goods and also services
She'd love to hold the money for ya (she'll hold that cash)
Just keep the bunnies far from… Anya!
Jenny:​ I need to call out Willow for not knowing how the fuck to gift wrap
something.
Kristin:​ Yo, Willow is the worst—
Jenny:​ What's wrong with this girl?!
Kristin:​ This is bad. I'm not good at wrapping things, but this is real bad.
Jenny:​ Yeah, it looks like… it just looks like something she pulled out of the trash
when she's done.


Kristin:​ [laughs] Her hands are like, stuck inside of it when she's done. [both
laugh] And Anya, ever Anya, is like, "yeah, it looks good if you wrapped it with your
feet." Which like, accurate. Accurate. Also, fucking Giles is losing his mind. He's
like, [frantically] "There's—so many—people! And I don't know what to do." And
before Xander talks to Anya, he's like, "Listen, man. Stay British. You'll be okay."
[both laugh] Which is cute. Okay! So then we get to the part in the episode where
Anya basically is like, "hey, I've got an idea. There was this sorcerer named
Cloutier. And he was so cute in his little knickers.
Jenny:​ Aw!
Kristin:​ And he had this—yeah, I mean, I would love more backstory on that. But
he had this trance spell—or trance that you could put yourself in to see spells. You
could see—we learn that every spell leaves sort of like a signature mark that
humans can't see. But with this spell, you can see it. So Buffy's like, "cool, I'll do it
because then I can figure out what's hurting my mom." And you know, they're a
little worried. They're like, "really? Are you sure?" and she's like, "I've been training
for this moment, I've got it, guys."
Jenny:​ Yeah. So she goes home to do the spell. And she asks Riley to help her out,
but there's really nothing for him to do, as he is quick to notice and inquire about.
And she says, "no, there's like, magic incense and spooky sand. I really—"
Kristin:​ Spooky sand is—
Jenny:​ —"could use some help wrangling the spooky sand."
Kristin:​ [laughs] Yeah.
Jenny:​ And Riley's like, "is this to make up for me, you know, being all weak and
kitteny?"
Kristin:​ He says "kittenish," she corrects him to say—
Jenny:​ No, no, he says kitteny, and she corrects him to kittenish.
Kristin:​ Oh, it's kittenish. I thought it was kitteny. I think you're wrong, actually.
Jenny:​ You wanna put $5 down, make it interesting?
Kristin:​ Five bucks. Five bucks down. Five bucks says Buffy says "kitteny" and
Riley says "ah, kitteny, much manlier than kittenish." Getting nervous over there,
aren't you, Jenny?


Jenny:​ No.
Kristin:​ Quaking in your boots, aren't you, Jenny?
Jenny:​ I'm done quaking because I've discovered that you're right.
Kristin:​ [laughs smugly] $5 for me!
Jenny:​ Okay, yeah, I'll Venmo you.
Kristin:​ [laughs] You better. I'm gonna take a screencap and prove it to everybody
that you did it.
Jenny:​ Ha!
Kristin:​ Okay. So Riley makes a good point and you know I say that very rarely on
this podcast. But he is like, "listen, how about instead of you taking care of me, we
agree to take care of each other." And—
Jenny:​ [sarcastically] Wow, what an asshole! What a terrible boyfriend! Who would
say such a thing?
Kristin:​ You don't have to be—you know, the more time goes by, the more and
more you become just like Riley, Jenny. [laughs]
Jenny:​ [laughs] Tall and broad-shouldered and butterscotchy and hunky? Thank
you.
Kristin: ​[laughs] Listen, I'm just trying to say that I think that this is a good point.
And I think Buffy thinks it's a good point too. She really is like, "oh, yeah, solid
point, man."
Jenny:​ Yeah. I mean, yeah, so much of her life is—even though she's got her
squad, so much of her life is about being the leader and the weight of the literal
world being on her shoulders. So it's really hard, I think, for her to get out of that
mode, which makes it—you know, I think that's a big challenge for her and for her
partners in her partnering.
Kristin:​ Totally. Yeah. So I think that this was a good moment for them, on sort of
the heels of a rough episode so far for them. But then, I'm sorry to just like, give
everybody whiplash, because then we just come to a screeching halt when she's
like, "can you kiss me a little bit better?" And then he tries to? Or does—and it's—


Jenny:​ I wish that they didn't kiss all the time on camera. [laughs]
Kristin:​ It's rough. It's real rough. It's—
Jenny:​ Well, you know, do you think it's extra hard because they're, I think, more
than a foot different in height? I think she's 5'2" and he's like, 6'3" or something.
Kristin:​ Listen, I'm sure it's a little more difficult, but I'm just saying that they
should have figured it out by now.
Jenny:​ Oh sorry, he's 6'2", they're exactly one foot apart in height.
Kristin:​ I think—I really think that there are people in this world who are one foot
difference who can kiss more passionately than this hunk of cardboard kisses her.
I'm sorry.
Jenny:​ Okay. Okay.
Kristin:​ Okay, so. Buffy makes a really horrible circle out of red sand. It's almost a
square, it's so bad.
Jenny:​ [laughs] She really did need help wrangling the spooky sand!
Kristin:​ [laughing] She did, yeah! And Dawn wants to watch and Buffy's a jerk
about it. She's like, "fuck off, Dawn."
Jenny:​ Then we get a little Santa Barbara B-roll, hey!
Kristin:​ You love Santa Barbara B-roll.
Jenny:​ [simultaneously] And hours go by, the sun goes down, the sun sets over
Santa Barbara, I mean, Sunnydale. And then Buffy is tripping.
Kristin:​ Yeah, she's tripping hard. There's like, wind chimes in the background—
Jenny:​ Not that I know anything about tripping. I just assume this is kinda what
it's like.
Kristin:​ Sure, sure, sure. Jenny, have you—I know that you and I both have done
mushrooms. But have you ever done LS—
Jenny:​ [shouts] Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is a family podcast. [laughs]


Kristin:​ Well, like, everybody has mushrooms, like with their chicken and, you
know, in their soup—
Jenny:​ Oh, right, yes. Yes, I like shitake mushrooms and baby portabellos—
Kristin:​ Yeah. But I was just wondering if you'd ever, like, used any stamps on
your mail.
Jenny:​ No, no, I've never done acid. Have you?
Kristin:​ No, I have not. I have not. I've done a lot of mushrooms and never acid.
'Cause I think at heart, you and I are both hippies. Which is why I chose to do
mushrooms and not acid. I was like, "these come from the earth. They have to be
safer."
Jenny:​ Ha! I was just like, "these are available."
Kristin:​ [laughs] Okay! So where are we? She's tripping. She's tripping, and I have
a question. And it actually is related to tripping, which is, if you send your friend off
with a bag of mushrooms or a bag of magical mushroom trippy sand supplies,
wouldn't you at least go with her? Like, somebody should have been in the house
with her. Like, Willow is in the basement or somebody is somewhere.
Jenny:​ Yeah, well, I think the deal is that the Magic Box is so bananas that they
couldn't.
Kristin: ​They can't?
Jenny:​ Nobody could get away. Where's Tara?
Kristin:​ Where ​is T
​ ara? But yeah, I just—I find it—I was nervous for Buffy because
it's very apparent that she really is tripping pretty hard. And then she's just alone,
like, walking around in her house, tripping. Which cannot be good, cannot be fun.
But anyhow.
Jenny:​ Yeah, I can say from someone else's experience that this is not your ideal
scenario.
Kristin:​ [laughs] Right. So she runs into Joyce down at the foot of the stairs. And
there's nothing. And that's what Buffy says. Joyce is like, "what the fuck is wrong
with you?" But…


Jenny:​ [laughs] Yeah.
Kristin:​ What we're learning is, of course, that there is no spell around Joyce. Now,
this is really fucking cool. I don't know how you feel about this reveal, but like,
when she—
Jenny:​ I think it's awesome.
Kristin:​ It's amazing, right? She looks up at the picture of Dawn, Joyce and herself,
and the image of Dawn is just fading in and fading out of the picture.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ It's like, bone-chillingly fucking cool. And if you watch this—
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ In real time, and this is the moment when you're putting it all together. I
just felt my stomach flip and this is, like, the eighth time I've watched this episode
at this point.
Jenny:​ Yeah, it's definitely… unsettling.
Kristin:​ Yeah. And we've talked so much about how well they do dream sequences
and I think that this goes in that bucket of, like, this isn't technically a dream but
it's dream-adjacent. And we see it in the pictures that she picks up. She goes into
Dawn's room—
Jenny:​ Dude! Dude! She goes into Dawn's room and you see all of Dawn's pre-teen
or early-teen girl ​accoutrement e
​ verywhere. And then it's like fading in between
that and sort of like a storage—it just looks like they have a room in the house
where they put everything that they don't know what to do with. And, you know,
paintings that aren't on the wall and just stuff that's being stored. Clearly
illustrating that Faith could have totally lived in that room. [Kristin laughs] It's not
like the monks created that room. Faith could have lived there and been okay.
Kristin:​ Wow.
Jenny:​ Another reason I'm mad at Dawn!
Kristin:​ Yeah, you thought—wait! Dawn had nothing to do with that! [laughs]
Jenny:​ Ah, well!


Kristin:​ You should be mad at Joyce and Buffy and everyone else.
Jenny:​ She made me certain. She made me certain.
Kristin:​ Right, so, okay. Good point, solid point. Because I think in the beginning,
even you and I, Jenny, thought maybe when the monks created Dawn, that they
also created the extra room in the Summers house. But you're right, this proves
that they did not. That room was always there.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ And Dawn is like, "who said you could come into my room?" And Buffy's
like, "you're not my sister." And so—
Jenny:​ And we see Dawn, actual Dawn, fading in and out of existence also.
Kristin:​ Yeah. And she's like, "you stay away from my mother." She slams her into
the door. And at this—
Jenny:​ Ahh!
Kristin:​ It's really rough, but I think it's especially rough because they—if you
watch this episode in real time, they put a couple of breadcrumbs down to make
you think that Dawn knows that she is something else, right?
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ We saw her writing that diary entry a couple episodes ago. And then they
designed her lines and her actions to kind of allow you as the viewer to believe that
she's in on this. But when you watch it again and you know she's not, it's like,
mega fucked up to know that she has no idea what's happening and her older sister
has just gotten violent with her and is saying really horrible things to her.
Jenny:​ Yeah, it's bad. Then the phone rings and it's Giles and he's like, "The glow
orb is a Dagon Sphere and it's used to ward off ancient primordial evil, that which
cannot be named." And she's about—Buffy's about to tell Giles what happened. But
then Dawn is over her shoulder like a frickin' horror movie. And a problem that I
have—
Kristin:​ Yeah.


Jenny:​ Is that Dawn acts like a total fucking twin out of The Shining for the rest of
the episode. And there's no reason for it.
Kristin:​ I agree.
Jenny:​ Like the way that she talks to Joyce in a little while? Blegh-legh-legh.
Kristin:​ I agree. I think that they could have—because obviously, this is what I was
just saying, right. That this is done intentionally, but I think that they could have
had the viewer believe it without being so heavy handed about it. Because it isn't
believable. Once you know that she didn't know, it's like—when she walks in with
the fucking tea cup? It's like—
Jenny:​ Come on!
Kristin:​ Right, it's very—I think it's a little over the top. So I get what they were
trying to do, but I agree with you. I think it's—there's not really a rhyme or reason
of how she acts for the balance of this episode. Until we get to the end.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ So Spike! So this a fucking… one of the biggest fucking moments in Buffy
history. Spike is—so the last time we saw Spike, he was having a sex dream about
Buffy the vampire Slayer. And I'm sure that you, if you were watching this in real
time, are like, "where the fuck—?" Like, 'cause that's how you ended it. And so
we've gone all this way in this episode, we haven't seen Spike, and it's like, come
on! And then there he is.
Jenny:​ Where. Is. Spike. Oh my god.
Kristin:​ Oh my god, and he fucking—so Buffy is like "Spike?" And he says—he
turns around and he has a cigarette in his mouth. And we've seen Spike a million
times, fucking puffing on his cigarette, talking Spike talk. He takes his cigarette out
of his mouth, he puts it out, and he's like, "Hi Buffy." [both laugh]
Jenny:​ Sir. Get a hold of yourself.
Kristin:​ Which is… incredible. He has lost all of his cool, lost all of it.
Jenny:​ Gone. Gone.
Kristin:​ It has just drained out of his body. She's like, "yo, tell me why you're
fucking here in my fucking yard. You've got five words or less."


Jenny:​ And he uses those words… he fills his quota in the following manner.
[Clip from episode plays]
Spike:​ Out. For. A. Walk. Bitch.
Jenny:​ Do you remember when we were are the vampire ball last year? In London.
Kristin:​ I do.
Jenny:​ And we were—during the parts of the day where we would hang out at a
table and people would bring stuff over for us to sign—how many people who had
just been to James Marsters table, who had James write "Out. For. A. Walk. Bitch"
on their James Marsters photo. [Kristin laughs] Like. So many.
Kristin:​ So many. He's a man who truly knows his audience. That scene where
Spike is in his crypt, sort of posing for the camera, in the black and white.
Jenny:​ Ha!
Kristin:​ James really also embodies that. He knows how to work a room, you know
what I'm saying? [Jenny laughs] So Buffy is very frustrated. And—so we're not up
to the Sexual Tension Awards yet, but Jenny and I had a bit of a debate about
some of our contenders for the nominations. And I said, don't worry, Jenny, I will
prove to you that there's sexual tension in this scene. And it isn't even—'cause I
think it's already there by the fact that he put his cigarette out and said "hi Buffy"
like a tiny little puppy dog. But I also think that it's there because after he says
"Out. For. A. Walk. Bitch," she says, "No one has time for this, ​William.​ " William!
Jenny:​ Ooh! Okay, okay, okay! Okay!
Kristin:​ She calls him fucking William, Jenny. So.
Jenny:​ I missed it and you're right.
Kristin:​ I rest my case.
Jenny:​ Okay.
Kristin:​ Thank you. We'll get to the full awards ceremony in a little bit, but that's
my case for this part. He's like—also, she's like, "why are you in my yard though?"


And he's like, "your house is between parts and other parts of this town!" [both
laugh] And then—
Jenny:​ Meanwhile, you know Spike woke up from that dream and he was like,
"okay. I need a plan of action. Now, previous suitors of Buffy… what have they
done? Ah, yes! They've stood outside of her house looking up at her window."
Kristin:​ [laughs] "Yeah, let me do that. Instead of charcoal, I'll make cigarette
ash."
Jenny:​ Exactly. He's just got the Angel playbook in his back pocket.
Kristin:​ Oh god. And then, you know, right before he leaves, he's like, "you need
some satisfaction, besides shagging Captain Cardboard"—there with you,
Spike—and then he just totally comes—he becomes completely discombobulated.
Jenny:​ Yeah, he unravels.
Kristin:​ He's like, "and I never really liked you anyway. And you have stupid hair!"
[laughs]
Jenny:​ When we know from last episode—
Kristin:​ Uh-huh.
Jenny:​ That he thinks she has shampoo commercial hair.
Kristin:​ That's true. Getting your stories mixed, buddy! You're getting your stories
mixed. And then Buffy sees that of course, he was not just smoking that one
cigarette. There's a whole pile of butts.
Jenny:​ There are like 7,000 cigarette butts on the ground.
Kristin:​ Yeah, he's just been like, staring—watching Buffy trip fucking face from
outside. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Ha!
Kristin:​ Also, something that I never noticed before—which I'm sure all of you did.
I just somehow didn't—is that as she leaves, Dawn's creepy fucking head is up in
the screen window upstairs.
Jenny:​ Oh my god, I missed that. [visibly shakes self]


Kristin:​ Oh, it's really funny actually. Okay, so Buffy goes to the warehouse. She
sees the hole in the wall. Joyce comes home, we talked about how Dawn is being
fucking weird with her cup of tea. She's like, [sinister] "I made this for you,
Mother."
Jenny:​ Why so creepy?
Kristin:​ But then, we go to the warehouse for real. Buffy's in. And she sees the
monk, who's tied to the chair, and she's like, "you planted the Dagon Sphere. I
know you did that for me." And the Beast is behind Buffy, doing a dance. And if you
are familiar with GIFs of Buffy—
Jenny:​ Ha!
Kristin:​ This is an infamous GIF of her in her little red dress with her perfect hair,
bouncing back and forth from one foot to the other. But Buffy knows she's there!
Jenny:​ Yes! But it's not good enough. It doesn't really do her a whole lot of good to
know that the Beast is there, because the Beast just kinda tosses her across the
room. Right? Or no. The Beast punches her across the room.
Kristin:​ Yeah. Well, she—well, I mean, she does all of those things. But the first
thing that she does is she fucking punches her and she flies across the room.
Jenny:​ It's bad.
Kristin:​ She cracks the wall.
Jenny:​ It's very bad.
Kristin:​ And we know immediately, like, this is—we've never seen—ahh, maybe we
have? But very rarely do we see Buffy sort of fly through the air like she does after
she's hit.
Jenny:​ Yeah. It's bad.
Kristin:​ So this is serious. Anya, back at the Magic Box, gets offered a job.
Jenny:​ She's got loads of input about how Giles needs to move forward with his
business. And he says—
Kristin:​ And it's all good input.


Jenny:​ "Dear Lord, if I offer you a job, will you please stop talking to me right
now?"
Kristin:​ [laughs] And she's so proud! "Okay, boss!"
Jenny:​ She's like, "Okay! Boss!" I love it!
Kristin:​ So meanwhile, the fight between Buffy and this unnameable Beast is
continuing. And it's really quite a cool to fight to watch, because they are exactly
the same size and they also have, it seems, the exact same capacity for quipping.
Which we also don't get very often. We'll get that with a Spike and Buffy fight, like,
we get that.
Jenny:​ Right.
Kristin:​ They're fighting, they're kind of equally matched. They're not the same
size, but almost. [laughs] And they both quip, you know, they're both being funny.
And we get that here. She's like, "you hit me!" Then she, like, punches just a full
piece of cement off of the wall with one tiny blond fist. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Oh my god.
Kristin:​ Throws Buffy across the room. And then Buffy takes the monk and jumps
through the window, reminiscent of when Faith and Buffy flew through the window
together.
Jenny:​ Ahh, happier times.
Kristin:​ Yes. And the Beast would have probably easily caught them and captured
them, but she broke a heel.
Jenny:​ Yo. Those heels… are tough… to watch. There's a closeup earlier in the
episode when she's pacing in front of the camera, and it's like, at floor level. And
watching her feet kind of shake a little bit—
Kristin:​ Wobble. Yeah.
Jenny:​ On those heels is very stressful.
Kristin:​ Yeah.


Jenny:​ But she breaks her heel, she stops. She stomps. And basically her stomp
brings the whole building down.
Kristin:​ Yeah, she breaks her heel and then her heel breaks the house. You know
what I mean?
Jenny:​ Heh-heh-heh.
Kristin:​ Ha-ha-ha! So then we get probably the most important information that
we've gotten this season, outside, between the monk and Buffy.
Jenny:​ Yes! The monk is like, "you must protect the Key. Many will die if you don't
keep it safe. The Key is energy, it's a portal, it opens the door." Buffy's like, "The
Dagon Sphere?" And he's like, "no, no, no, it's a whole other thing. We kept it safe
but then the Abomination found us. We turned it into a human and sent it to you."
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ And Buffy's like, "Dawn."
Kristin:​ Yeah. And she's like, "what about my memories?" And he's like, "we built
them." And she's like—this is like… this is really mass—
Jenny:​ This is traumatic.
Kristin:​ It's like, massive trauma. And it's also like, a massive reflection of Buffy
and what we often, I think, forget about Buffy's power and strength. Because it's…
this monk is telling her that he has—he and his other monks have entirely violated,
not only her home, but her body. They've put this human that—and we learn, and
that's important too, that Dawn is human and helpless and has no idea. She's been
also, I guess you could say—she's also been violated in the sense that she's been
created and also has been given fake memories. Joyce's memories have been
forced. Giles, every—literally everyone anyhow tied to this family has had their
memories altered to accept Dawn.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ And she—on the—sorry to use "heels" again since we just got real heely in
the last conversation. But on the heels of this conversation, where she has quite
literally just learned about this violation, this trauma, this—who—there's not even a
word for it, that's how big it is.
Jenny:​ Yeah.


Kristin:​ She goes home and she accepts Dawn at—like, she gives the love to Dawn
that—basically the monk has told her, like, "she's innocent." And Buffy holds onto
that, that's what she closes in her palm and holds onto when she goes back for this
final scene. Which is chilling. It really—when I was watching it—and I think—I'm
sure it's chilling for all of us to see some of the ways that Buffy shows her strength.
And we all, I think, you know, use Buffy's strength as a metaphor for a lot of things
and to reflect on our own abilities.
Jenny:​ Mm-hmm.
Kristin:​ But we're so deep, you and I, Jenny, in this experience. You know, you're
writing a fucking song from her perspective every other week. We talk about this
show constantly, we're watching the episodes many, many times. And so I think
being that deep and really watching her do this in this last scene just shook me in a
very powerful way, of like, really thinking about what she's doing in this moment.
Jenny:​ [exhales] Yeah, it is such a massive metabolization…
Kristin:​ Yeah!
Jenny:​ That she is able to execute. But I think probably some of it has to do with
her, you know, just being ready to have the weight of the world on her shoulders.
And some of it has to do with… she still has 13 years of memories—
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ 14 years of memories. Even if they're not real, they're still there. You
know?
Kristin:​ Yeah. That's true, and they give a nod to that in this final scene. So after
the monk—the monk dies, we should say. RIP monk.
Jenny:​ RIP monk.
Kristin:​ Yeah, and Buffy goes home and goes up to Dawn, who's like, "you hurt my
arm, butthole." [laughs] "I have this theory. The theory is that I'm Mom's real
daughter"—which is quite ironic—"and you were adopted from a bunch of baby
howler monkeys." And Buffy says she's sorry and Dawn's not accepting it. And she's
like, "you can't even accept an apology. You always do that, ever since—" and it's
the first time that she accesses a memory and realizes it's a fake memory, which is
really powerful. And Sarah Michelle Gellar, I mean, do we even need to say how
incredible she is?


Jenny:​ Nah.
Kristin:​ Like, it's—
Jenny:​ So good!
Kristin:​ What a thing to play, right? It's so nuanced and small and it's so
believable. You see it flash across her fucking eyes, and it's just really incredible.
And… you know, they have this cute sisterly banter where—
Jenny:​ About the Bad Day Club and Dawn's the president and Buffy's like, "can I
be the vice president?" and Dawn's like, "no, you're the janitor."
Kristin:​ Yeah, and then she—
Jenny:​ I actually don't know if Buffy says "can I be the vice president?" or some
other office, but is relegated to the janitor position.
Kristin:​ Yeah. She's sort of playing with Dawn's hair, which is just a really big
gesture of love. Like, whether it's sisterly love or not, it's just like, this is a very
tender, caring action. And Dawn looks at her, as the last thing that we see in this
scene, and she says, "What's wrong with Mom?" And Buffy says, "I don't know."
Jenny:​ Ugh!
Kristin:​ Which is also, like… right? We spend the episode sort of like, oh god,
what's—they're gonna—we're gonna see the spell and oh my god, Dawn's the key,
and da-da-da-da-da, that you could almost forget that the reason that they did this
spell was to see what was harming Joyce. But now that it's revealed that nothing is
harming Joyce, what does that mean? What is going on with Joyce? Are the
headaches a result of the memories that are being forced on her? Like, they don't
know and that's also super scary. So Buffy's come home with all of this and is
holding it. I feel like the image of the end of this episode is Buffy sort of wrapping
up the whole Summers home in her arms and just holding it, you know?
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Which is really moving and powerful. Bah!
Jenny:​ Oof, you're telling me.


Kristin:​ You know what can lift the mood, Jenny, from this tender, loving, sad
strength moment is… sex. What else.
[SEXUAL TENSION AWARD jingle plays]
Sexual tension award!
Jenny:​ Well, it's that magical time in the episode where we… nominate some
people for Sexual Tension… and an award that goes along with it.
Kristin:​ [starts humming tune to Final Countdown] [Jenny laughs] Just kidding,
just kidding, just kidding! Just kidding, that was last week's joke. [both laugh]
Okay, Jenny, we got four. We got four sets for—and this was a hard one, I just
wanna say that Jenny and I both really struggled with getting you good nominees.
There was not a lot of overt sexual tension.
Jenny:​ No, that's not what this episode is about. But we found it where we could
and here are your nominees! In the first slot, one pairing that you could vote for if
you want to, is Spike and Buffy.
Kristin:​ Yeah—
Jenny:​ 'Cause Buffy's calling him William, and he's smoking a lot of cigarettes
outside her house.
Kristin:​ I think I'm gonna put "Buffy and William" as the actual contender.
Jenny:​ Ha! Okay, beautiful. Okay. Next up, while we're talking about Buffy, why
don't we talk about Buffy and Ben? Because… he's all in his scrubs, and she's all
like, "I'm very, very, very strong" and he's all like, "I'm alarmed by that." But
perhaps there's something more there—
Kristin:​ I'm alarmed and a little aroused.
Jenny:​ Exactly, exactly. Sometimes alarm can develop into something else over
time. [Kristin laughs] So Ben and Buffy is in slot two. In slot three, we've got—are
you ready? The most that anybody sweat in this or perhaps any episode of Buffy
the Vampire Slayer, it's the Beast and the Key. The Beast wants the Key!
Kristin:​ Yes, and I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to correct you. Angel sweat more
than anyone will ever sweat—
Jenny:​ Ha!


Kristin:​ In this entire series, combined. During the—
Jenny:​ You're right.
Kristin:​ Yes, you know what I'm—you all know what I'm talking about.
Jenny:​ When he fell naked from the sky?
Kristin:​ When he—oh! Yeah, but also, when he was so sick because Faith shot him
with an arrow.
Jenny:​ Oh, yeah—okay. Never mind, Angel has—
Kristin:​ Collective amounts of sweat are massive from Angel, so.
Jenny:​ The Sweat-ual Tension Award— [Kristin laughs] definitely was awarded to
Angel. And then—[laughs] in the fourth slot, wow! Uh, I just want her here, there
and everywhere. It's Anya and money. Because we're starting to see—
Kristin:​ Oh. Probably—no spoilers, but probably not the last time that Anya and
money will be a contender. [laughs]
Jenny:​ Yeah, seems likely we might see more of that pairing. So if you'd like to be
part of our beautiful democracy, please find the Sexual Tension Award for this
episode on our Twitter, @BufferingCast. And cast your vote. Oh god.
Kristin:​ Ooh, cast and cast, you say!
Jenny:​ That's right, I said it.
Kristin:​ Yeah, the poll stays up for seven days and we recommend that you vote
today, if this is the day that it goes live, because sometimes some of you email me
and you're like, "I can't find the poll!" and I'm like, "well, you just have to dig back.
You have to scroll back through all of the GIFs and all of the tweets and you have to
find it." [both laugh] So if today is Wednesday, go now and cast your vote,
@BufferingCast.
[SEXUAL TENSION AWARD jingle plays]
Sexual tension award!
Kristin:​ Great, great, great, great, great. Jenny, I believe that we have done yet
another glorious episode of Buffering the Vampire Slayer.


Jenny:​ Truly, we have. It's over, there's just one thing left for us to do, which is to
say who we are and where to find us.
Kristin:​ Who are you?
Jenny:​ Therefore! [gasps] Thank you for asking. I am Jenny Owen-Youngs and
when I'm not watching Buffy and making this podcast, I am usually making another
podcast, a newer podcast, called Veronica Mars Investigations with my buddy Helen
Zaltzman. So you can listen to us talk about a different, petite protagonist who is
fair of hair and keen of mind over on that pod. [Kristin laughs] And! The thing I do
the most, the thing I do more than anything else is make hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
jams. And I will tell you what, I have five of them in a body known as an EP coming
out this very Friday. Friday, November 15, my EP, Night Shift, will be out on all
digital platforms and available on vinyl and CD. And you can find it via my website,
jennyowenyoungs.com. And you can find it by searching my name on your digital
platform of choice. Please listen to some jams if you want to. Cool, that's me, okay.
Oh, also, you can give me a shout on Twitter @JennyOwenYoungs, any time. Any
old time, I'm there!
Kristin:​ So exciting. It's like, the monks took the Key energy and turned it into a
human named Dawn and you took all your music energy and you turned it into an
EP named Night Shift.
Jenny:​ Called Night Shift! That's right!
Kristin:​ Yeah! I—
Jenny:​ Who are you?
Kristin:​ [laughs] When I'm not using Buffy to make metaphors for Jenny's music, I
am doing a lot of different things. Namely, I have a podcast that is short—a short
run. It's a My So-Called Life podcast called The Boiler Room. I'm doing it with
Joanna Robinson and we are 10 episodes into our 19-episode run, so we have
passed the halfway mark. We're having so much fun. Joanna got the chance to talk
to Devon Odessa, who plays Sharon. We have a couple of other really fun
interviews coming up. It has been a great time. It's one of my favorite shows and if
you've never seen it, you should.
And also, as you probably know already, I do a lot of work with the LGBTQ
community. I've been setting up Skype sessions with middle school and high school
GSAs as a new initiative where I'm raising funds to offset the costs for them, so I
get to offer them for free. It's been really fun and you can find out all about that
and more on my website, kristinnoeline.com. That's K-R-I-S-T-I-N N-O-E-L-I-N-E.


Jenny:​ You did not say your name at the top of that. And it—while you were
talking, I was like, thinking about that and how I might let you know at the end of
it. And then all I could think of was, what if every time you said your name at the
end of the episode, you were like, "my! Name! Is! Kriiiiiiiiiiistin!" [Kristin laughs]
Just a thought. Just something to think about for the future. Cool. Buffinering the
Vampire Slayer [laughs] is on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, @BufferingCast.

Laura:​ Hey, you beautiful Scoobs. This is Laura Zak from Angel On Top.
Brittany:​ And I'm Brittany Ashley, also from Angel On Top.
Laura:​ For the last year or so, it has been our great honor to host a sister podcast
to Buffering the Vampire Slayer in which we rewatch every episode of the Buffy
spinoff, Angel, in tandem with the equivalent Buffy episodes.
Brittany:​ If you've not yet taken the journey from Sunnydale to Los Angeles to
brood with us, and even if you've never watched an episode of Angel in your life,
we're here to tell you that Season 2 is a magnificent time to join our family.
Laura:​ The second season of Angel is jam-packed with objectively good television.
And you can expect more of your favorites like Cordelia coming into her own
powers, Wesley battling inner and outer demons, Angel walking his cluttered path
to redemption, cameos from Buffy regulars like Faith, Spike and Willow. And-Brittany:​ More Darla, Darla, Darla! Plus, you'll get to know new characters who are
some of the best in the entire Whedonverse, like Charles Gunn, defender of
downtown LA's most vulnerable, and Lorn, the emotionally intelligent demon who
runs a karaoke bar.
Laura:​ Our Angel On Top community is growing every day, and we'd love for you
to join us for queer, feminist analysis, new jingles and every episode, a new poem
from Angel's point of view.
Brittany:​ You can find Angel On Top on iTunes, Spotify and Google Play.
Laura:​ Until then, see you at the next crossover.
Brittany:​ Ooh!
