Buffering the Vampire Slayer
Episode 7.09: Never Leave Me
[CHIME]
Kristin: Hey there, Scoobies. It’s just Kristin and my voice is at a high pitch,
because I’m really excited. It is March 9th, if you’re listening to this when it’s airing,
wh—ich means that we are two days away from the biggest event that we’ve ever
had. This Friday, March 11th, we will be celebrating the 25th anniversary of the
premiere of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There might be a couple of in-person tickets
left for that event, but I know for sure that there are virtual tickets to attend. They
are available to anyone, all you need is an internet connection. We are broadcasting
through Moment House, and the live stream will start live with us inside of
Sunnydale High School. Literally, we will be broadcasting from Torrance High
School, where Buffy was filmed. It all begins at 7 PM Pacific time, 10 PM Eastern,
and that live stream on Moment House will be available for Video on Demand for
seven days following the event. So if you can’t make it in real time, you can still
grab a virtual ticket and watch it after the effect.
It’s also the only way you can access our exclusive Prom merchandise. We have
some really cool t-shirts and pins and tank tops and hoodies. It’s also the only way
that you can access our exclusive Prom merchandise unless you are at the event
physically. So you can get all of that and find out all of the information at
momenthouse.com/bufferingthevampireslayer. That’s moment
house—M-O-M-E-N-T-H-O-U-S-E—dot com slash Buffering the Vampire Slayer. This
Friday, March 11th, 7 PM Pacific, 10 PM Eastern.
We will be joined by special guest Evan Ross Katz who is about to release a
phenomenal book on the show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer. We’ll be joined by Joanna
Robinson, who’s gonna have a lot to say from inside of Sunnydale High School. And
our arch nemeses-es-is, Morgan and LaToya from Angel On Top. It’s gonna be an
epic evening. Jenny’s gonna play some music. We’re going to have the best freaking
time. Also, I’m so excited that I forgot to tell you that Jenny isn’t even here in the
introduction. [laughs] She is, um, you know, preparing for the event and also a
huge tour that she’s going on with Hrishi Hirway. So I’m here—I’m up here by
myself, but don’t worry, we’ll be united in an epic way very, very soon. Again, if
you’re in the Los Angeles area and you wanna try to scoop one of those last
remaining tickets for Friday night, you can. All of that information can be found on
our website.
Alright. Normally when I do Sexual Tension Awards and Jenny isn’t here, I, like, do
an impression of her or whatever. But you know what, it’s two days from Prom and


I am feeling sexy myself. So I am going to tell you—and this is also—like, this really
is about me, these winners. So these are the results from Sleeper, two weeks ago.
In fourth place—well, it’s nice, ‘cause fourth place gets foursomes. It’s Charlotte,
the vampire at The Bronze, and foursomes, 1.7% of the vote. Coming in third, we
have the very British pair of Robson and Giles. Did they kiss before Robson got
killed? Who knows? We think so. 12.3% of the vote. Second place, a lot of tension
here. I’m surprised they only clocked 21% of the vote. Sunnydale and the thing
beneath it. And winning, because I know what’s good and so do you, Anya and
butts, 65% of the vote. If Jenny were here, she would say, I feel a little
disappointed in the 4% of you who didn’t bring that to a clean 69%. Emily Brackets
McLongstreet has already created for us a GIF of Anya chomping through many,
many, many peach emojis. And now that Anya and butts have won, we will get to
see what she creates for the final bracket of Season 7, so. [laughs]
Alright. Two more things for you. I hope—who knows? I don’t know what I’m doing
anymore. I’m just simply so excited. First of all, for the first time in history, this
episode is airing without a song at the end. And that is because I told Jenny that
she was allowed to wait until she got back from tour to conquer this song. It was
very hard for her, so I would love for you to give her all the love that she deserves.
She really wanted to make it happen, but I said, it’s okay, Jenny. They’ll be okay
without a song. When you come back, you can make the song, and then we’ll put it
in the episode later. So there won’t be a song, but don’t worry, of course there will
be a song for Never Leave Me. You’re just gonna have to give Jenny Owen Youngs a
few more weeks to make that happen for us.
Last but not least, this made me cry earlier today [laughs] when I learned that so
many of you all are planning meet-ups and tours and all sorts of things while you’re
out in Los Angeles to join us for Prom. So if that’s you, if you’re a person who is
coming to join us on Friday or Saturday night, or both, please know that I have put
up a landing page for these Scooby-led meet-ups. You can find it at
bufferingthevampireslayer.com/promups. That’s P-R-O-M-U-P-S. Get it? Like
meet-ups but for prom, prom-ups? Cool. It’ll take you to a landing page, it’s
basically a google folder that Scoobies have created. They’re doing a tour of Sony
studios. They’re meeting up before the live taping. They’re doing a tour of Torrance
starting at the Marriott hotel. They’re meeting up after the prom at a local gay bar,
of course they are! There’s a whole bunch of things. It’s all listed for you.
It truly—I mean, you’ll hear—if you’re gonna be at the event, you’re gonna hear me
say this a lot. But Jenny and I are so emotional and overwhelmed about how
wonderful you all are and how excited we are together with you. So, alright. To
many of you, I will see you this Friday, either in person or virtually. I cannot wait.
Again, if you wanna join us virtually, those tickets are at


momenthouse.com/bufferingthevampireslayer. Hell yes, happy 25th anniversary,
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
[Buffering theme plays]
Jenny: Hello and welcome to Buffering the Vampire Slayer, a podcast where we are
watching and discussing every episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, one by one,
spoiler free, in tandem with those gals I’d never jam both my arms clear through a
bunch of drywall, [Kristin laughs] to then grab and rip through said drywall—
Kristin: I would.
Jenny: [simultaneously] And then bite!
Kristin: I would.
Jenny: Not ever, not one time. Angel On Top. I’m Jenny Owen Youngs. [laughs]
Kristin: I would do it, but I would hug them on the other side of the wall.
Jenny: Aww! It is a nice hug.
Kristin: You know? It is. It’s a nice little embrace before the biting happens.
Jenny: Mmhmm!
Kristin: I am Kristin Russo and this week, we are talking about Buffy Season 7,
Episode 9, Never Leave Me. Stay tuned at the end of this podcast every other week
for an original song, written by Jenny—sometimes with friends—
Jenny: Mmhmm!
Kristin: [simultaneously] Recapping the Buffy episode we are discussing.
Jenny: Never Leave Me was written by Drew Goddard, directed by David Solomon
and originally aired on the face of a new world—
Kristin: Wow.
Jenny: On November 26th, 2002.


Kristin: Oh, so it was the face of a new world for you, Jenny Owen Youngs, who
had turned 21.
Jenny: Yes.
Kristin: But not us—I thought we—I thought you were rolling us into 2003. I was
like, wow, did we do it? Or—
Jenny: Nope. [laughs]
Kristin: We didn’t, we’re still in 2002.
Jenny: That would have been quite a jump. [both laugh] For some reason, there
was a one-year gap between Season 7, Episode 8, and Season 7, Episode 9. [both
laugh]
Kristin: No. It’s—we’re in November—what year are we in? We’re in November
2002.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: So it wouldn’t be a one-year gap, it’d would be a two-month gap. Not
even.
Jenny: But I said November—27—and you—[laughs]
Kristin: [simultaneously] Well, but I—before you started November, is when I
thought—okay?
Jenny: Oh, you thought this was just gonna be a January episode.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: I see, I see, I see, okay.
Kristin: You guys thought that this was gonna be a—we were gonna make it to the
end of the seventh season, but this is it. Jenny and I—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Just got into a fight and we’re ending the podcast.


Jenny: [simultaneously] No, I mean, clearly we are professionals who have been
honing our craft [Kristin laughs] for the last six years. And, uh…
Kristin: Hey, it’s a noble art to both hone your craft and also remain the stupid
dummies that you were at the beginning. You know? It’s important.
Jenny: The proof is in…the podding!
Kristin: [laughs] This is the one, according to IMDB…[laughs] Jenny’s making her
labrador face, wanting a treat. You want a little bone? You want a little…
Jenny: [uncertain] Mmm!
Kristin: A little…
Jenny: No, I’m okay.
Kristin: What would be your dog treat? A little cup of coffee? You want a little cup
of coffee?
Jenny: Yes, I do, thank you. [both laugh] Don’t give your dogs coffee, people.
Kristin: My mom’s dog drinks her coffee. Like, not—like, every time my mom
leaves the room. It’s because my mom drinks coffee—I know this is what the intro
is supposed to contain. But like, my mom drinks coffee that is, like, 50% coffee and
50% the, like, creamer that you buy that, like, you could leave on the shelf for 412
years and it would still be good, the, like—
Jenny: It’s like—it’s basically liquid pumpkin pie that your dog—your mom’s dog is
eating.
Kristin: [simultaneously] Right. It’s like, mocha-peppermint blast! And you’re like,
what even is this? So I think the dog is more into whatever that is than the actual
coffee.
Jenny: Eugh!
Kristin: Anyway, don’t worry, my mom knows that her dog isn’t supposed to have
coffee. According to IMDB, this is not the one about my mom’s dog drinking coffee.
It is the one where “Buffy hopes to learn more about what she’s up against with the
First! [Jenny gasps] By taking Spike prisoner. Xander and Anya interrogate Andrew.”


They sure the fuck do, don’t they? [both laugh] Alright, thank you for bearing with
all of my tangents, Jenny.
Jenny: Well, speaking of tangents, Kristin, I’ve assessed, I’ve done the research,
I’ve checked the logs. And I’m gonna guess that this episode came in short because
the Previously Ons are two minutes and twelve seconds long. [Kristin laughs] And
there’s also one really weird ADR hold situation that I will highlight [laughing] when
we get there that makes me think they were just, like, trying to milk every second
they could cram into this episode.
Kristin: Yeah, it did feel—like, I mean, I enjoy this episode. But it
definitely—especially as someone who diligently takes notes though every
episode—I, like, got to the end of taking notes and was like, oh. Well, that
wasn’t—you know. [both laugh] Like, there was some—there was some meaty stuff
in here, but all in all, it felt like a lighter episode. Not lighter in, like, a ha-ha way
but lighter in terms of how much content we in-took.
Jenny: Yeah, they’re just—they’re definitely just trying to get to the end point of
the episode.
Kristin: Yeah, ‘cause this is, like, the—this is like, we are establishing now. Like,
we—a lot of shit—
Jenny: [simultaneously] [singsong] Things are happening.
Kristin: Yeah, now we’re in. We’ve had the girls back in the Previously Ons getting
murdered, for a couple episodes. And now, I mean, forget it. The fucking Council
goes ka-blooey. We get the First named. We got a lot of shit—
Jenny: Yep, yep, yep.
Kristin: [simultaneously] We’re laying down the bricks, people!
Jenny: Let me take you on a tour—a whirlwind tour—
Kristin: Okay.
Jenny: A rollercoaster ride through the Previouslys. Previously on Buffy the
Vampire Slayer, Andrew and Warren and Jonathan, oh my. There was a bloody seal.
Dawn saw Joyce and Joyce said some scary stuff and Willow said, nah, that was a
fake mom. And Willow also said the thing about chomping! And then some girls
were stabbed, you remember them, and then Spike’s been feeding on human blood.


And something was talking to him and making him do things. And also, Spike can
feel all his kill—I can feel the kill—does he real—you know what I mean? Does
that—do we necessarily need that in the Previously Ons to—
Kristin: No. I mean, we don’t need a lot of this. Because like, why do we have
Joyce saying that to Dawn in the Previously On, for example?
Jenny: And! Buffy’s gonna help him and keep him close. And Robson and Giles!
[laughs] It’s just like—
Kristin: [simultaneously] Dude! Also, how dare you end an episode—
Jenny: [simultaneously] It’s the whole episode. [laughs]
Kristin: With a fucking knife about to behead Giles and not give us an update? How
actually dare you.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Well, we do—we do get an update of sorts. We’ll get there.
[both laugh] I have some data for you to consider.
Kristin: Okay, alright. ‘Cause I’m pissed. But yeah, it was a very—[laughs] a very
long and winding Previously On. It’s kind of fitting, since our intro was longer and
windy-er than it ever has been before.
Jenny: Art imitates life—
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: Life imitates art, la-la-la.
Kristin: Oh.
Jenny: At the top of the episode, the question—[laughs]
Kristin: [simultaneously] Xander’s measuring twice.
Jenny: And cutting once, which we love.
Kristin: Uh-huh.
Jenny: And also, Dawn’s asking the question that many people watching this show
[Kristin laughs] who don’t have a crush on Spike are also always asking. Why is


Spike still alive? Anya—[laughs] very reasonably—shores up this inquiry by saying,
“Hey, shouldn’t we stab him through the chest? Isn’t that what we do when these
things happen?”
Kristin: Yeah, I mean—
Jenny: [simultaneously] As she tenderly fingers her now fully healed former chest
knife wound.
Kristin: [laughs] I mean, yeah, Dawn and Spike asking very similar questions
about Spike in this question. Why…am I alive?
Jenny: And check out Anya trying to recruit Xander—
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: To Team Kill Spike. But he’s refusing to get involved, for once.
Kristin: [simultaneously] Why? Like, I don’t—’cause we talked a little bit last
episode—
Jenny: [simultaneously] He’s busy measuring twice.
Kristin: About how, you know, I really—
Jenny: [simultaneously] [gasps] It’s because they were roommates.
Kristin: Do you think that is—like, do you think that’s what it was? Is like, when
they were roommates the first time, it was mostly just, like, a lust-based thing.
And then, [Jenny snorts] like, this time, they’re like—
Jenny: It’s become more tender?
Kristin: Yeah. Like, maybe it was a little more tender, they caught some feelings.
Because I don’t—I mean, I don’t know what other evidence we have here for
Xander being as sort of, like, balanced and—he’s sort of, like, in line with Willow,
which we haven’t seen, with Spike.
Jenny: I think—I think that he is displaying that he trusts Buffy?
Kristin: Yeah.


Jenny: You know, they’ve been having some pretty direct conversations about
Spike lately. And I think he’s just—you know—she’s the leader of the squad.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: And he’s getting behind her. Which, you know, is not always what he gets
up to.
Kristin: Yeah, well, I mean, I’m happy for it. Whether it happened because of
tender—tender roommates or just because of Xander growth, I am here for it. So.
[laughs] Anya ends this scene by saying, “I just think we should prepare for William
the Bloody to be back.” And then it cuts immediately to—
Jenny: Oh. [laughs]
Kristin: A swooping leather duster just walking confidently down the sidewalk—
Jenny: Yep.
Kristin: And the camera pans up and it’s fucking Andrew.
Jenny: It really is, and he doesn’t wanna do Incorporeal Warren’s bidding right
now. He just wants to walk around in his coat, okay? [both laugh]
Kristin: Andrew—not to, like—’cause this is—this is a hilarious episode. And Tom
Lenk is truly one of the fucking funniest motherfuckers out there. He is so good at
doing this. But I’ve just been reflecting a little bit on, like, my own feelings about
this kind of comedy being used to make us feel more endeared toward a character
[laughs] that ostensibly is pretty bad. Because, like, Warren is just awful. Like, he’s
never been anything but awful. And Jonathan—we talked about, of course—like,
was sort of always the—as much of a conscience as the Trio could have—was, like,
the conscience of the Trio. And like, was definitely grappling and made some good
choices and tried to make some other good choices. And like, Andrew just clearly is
a pissy little coward who wants what he wants for himself, and is fucking hysterical
in the pursuit of that. And so it just—I just, like, am trying to hold both of those
things through this viewing. Because I think every other viewing of this and also
just, like, characters like this, I just kind of let go of the evil. I’m like, eh, but
they’re so funny!
Jenny: Sure, sure, sure.


Kristin: Which feels a little dangerous. So I’m just saying that. That’s my—Kristin’s
Therapy Corner over here.
Jenny: Sure.
Kristin: It’s what I’m processing. [laughs]
Jenny: Well, you know, something that’s at the front of my mind, especially last
season and this season, is like, why do we watch television? A variety of reasons,
but I think one of the main ones is to have fun? But you need conflict—
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: To have a story.
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: So it’s nice. It kind of reminds me of the mayor, you know? It’s nice
sometimes to have—
Kristin: Right.
Jenny: Complex individuals [Kristin laughs] who make it really fun to watch this
show, even if they aren’t, you know, morally pure.
Kristin: Yeah. Yeah. And I’m here for that, I’m totally here for that. I think—I think
with the mayor, it’s really clear. That’s, like, you know—’cause like, the mayor is the
fucking Big Bad. The mayor is clearly wanting to, like, just destroy the world and
what have you. But the mayor has these complex things, like how much he loves
Faith and whatever. So that just feels a little clearer to me. Andrew’s just kinda like
bad news bears, but also hilarious. But yes. I mean, like, your point stands. I’m
just…I’m whittling even more nuance into it over here.
Jenny: Speaking of whittling.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Um…
Kristin: How are you gonna do that? Where—how’re you gonna—let’s see where
this transition from Jenny Owen Youngs goes.


Jenny: Nah, it’s nothing. [Kristin laughs] Here I am. You know, holding a scepter
that has a large jewel affixed at the top, waiting for exactly the right placement of
the sun, the 25th day of the second month. And I raise the scepter to the beam of
sun at exactly 12:15 PM Eastern time. And a shaft of sunlight pierces its way
through the gem, and is funneled directly onto a tiny crack in the wall I hadn’t
noticed before. And I walk over to the crack and I [blows out] blow on it. Dust flies,
and then I realize there’s a tiny little catch inside of this crack. And I get out my
knife and I jam it in there—
Kristin: [simultaneously] Just pause for a second. I just wanna, you know, let the
listener know that you and I both have no idea what Jenny is talking about. So
don’t feel confused. We’re all on this journey together. Continue, Jenny.
Jenny: With surgical precision, I deftly activate the catch hidden in the wall cleft.
And an unforeseen door springs open from the wall, revealing a hidden chamber.
And in that chamber…is a pedestal. And on that pedestal, bathed in sunlight from
above, is a tome entitled Kristin’s Erotic Novella.
Kristin: Wow.
Jenny: Volume 7.
Kristin: Wow.
Jenny: I open the book. I blow…across the pages. Dust flies everywhere. And texts
are revealed, magical texts, which you will now enjoy. “Don’t go soft on me now.
We’re right in the trench, and the exhaust port’s in sight. I need you. You’re my iron
fist.” [Kristin laughs] What do you think?
Kristin: I am impressed with the glory that my erotic novel or my erotic
novella—what was it in this story? I don’t remember.
Jenny: It’s a novella.
Kristin: Novella.
Jenny: You know.
Kristin: Yeah, fancier.
Jenny: Like, two and a half sentences.


Kristin: I couldn’t—I was just waiting with bated breath. What is gonna be on this
fancy, you know, display? What is so important? And I couldn’t believe when my
name was mentioned.
Jenny: Your own written works.
Kristin: My own words were there. [both laughing] Just absolutely astounding. I’m
glad that I stayed with the story. [laughs]
Jenny: Uh-huh.
Kristin: Yeah. Um, yeah. This is—there’s a few—there’s a couple of erotic little
novellas in here. But this one, um, is special. So Warren is basically talking about
how he can’t do these things ‘cause he’s incorporeal. You know.
Jenny: Mmm. Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin: You know that feeling when you’re incorporeal? [laughs]
Jenny: Yes, I do know that feeling!
Kristin: He says to Andrew, “I’m like your Obi-Wan.” And Andrew says, “Or Patrick
Swayze.” Okay.
Jenny: Anyone citing Patrick Swayze ever is, by default, horny, the end.
Kristin: The end. Also, Patrick Swayze—
Jenny: I don’t make the rules.
Kristin: Patrick Swayze and the movie Ghost have come up considerably in this
season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Because we were just talking about that kiln. To
the kiln? No. To the pottery wheel? What did you send them to? To the
pottery—you—I think you—
Jenny: Probably—well, first you go to the wheel, then you go to the kiln to fire it.
Kristin: Yeah, but I just—in my memory, I’m like, wow, did she say kiln though?
Because you meant pottery wheel. To the pottery wheel!
Jenny: Mmm.


Kristin: They don’t ever fire that pottery. They just fuck at the—they just fuck
around in the wet pottery.
Jenny: Oh, I finish what I start, Kristin.
Kristin: [laughing] Okay! I also want to let the listener know that a couple of years
ago, Joanna Robinson began showing me movies for the first time. And the way
that—the origin story was Star Wars. I had never seen any Star Wars. And in my
initial note-taking to the internet before I dove in, I accidentally revealed that I
thought that Obi-Wan was Obi-One. I was like, this is what I know about Star Wars.
There’s this guy and that guy and also Obi-One. [Jenny laughs] And everyone was
like, it is not the number one. [both laugh] So. Just letting everyone know.
Jenny: In your defense, you know, you’ve got R2D2—
Kristin: Right? C-3PO?
Jenny: [simultaneously] C-3PO.
Kristin: [laughs] There’s a lot of numbers. So. Anyway, yeah. Andrew clearly
wanting to have some kind of ghost sex with Warren. And—but also saying, like, “I
just don’t think I can kill anybody else.” [laughing] Like, as though that’s a good
quality.
Jenny: I think it’s interesting that we see—should we just start calling it the First?
Kristin: I guess so. I mean, you know, what Buffy says goes around here, so—
Jenny: Yeah. Yeah, we’re all just falling in line.
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: Warren the First morphs into Jonathan.
Kristin: Yep.
Jenny: And is like, “Hey, buddy! Thanks so much for killing me. This rules!
Everything’s gonna be okay. You’re doing great. Just trust us.”
Kristin: Yeah…and we learn that—[laughs] so this makes no sense. Because we
learn that Jonathan was too little. He didn’t have enough blood to open up this seal.


So then, riddle me this. Okay? Here’s some fucking—here’s a hell math question for
you.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: How much blood does Danny Strong have in his body, versus how much
does a tiny piglet have in its body?
Jenny: Well, I think—[both laugh] I think the idea—based on what we see later
with the amount of blood that comes out of Spike—
Kristin: Uh-huh.
Jenny: It looks like they just needed a top-off. They were like, [Kristin laughs] just
shy. [laughs]
Kristin: So it’s like—so, like, the—what is this thing called? The seal of
Danzal-thorpe?
Jenny: [laughing] Danzalthar. [both laugh] “Danzal-thorpe.”
Kristin: So like, it retained Jon—it’s just like, sort of like you’re filling it up to the—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: It’s like a fundraiser? Like, in—[laughing]
Jenny: It’s like, [creepy whisper] thirsty!
Kristin: You get to, like, $38,000 and they were just like—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: We need two more thousand and then we’ll be good.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Yeah, two more marks on the Erlenmeyer flask of
fundraising. [both laugh]
Kristin: Okay. Okay, well, I accept it. Yeah and good point, ‘cause Spike—it’s like, a
couple dribbles.
Jenny: Yeah.


Kristin: Okay, so. Anyway. Before we get to the credits, we do a quick cut to
Buffy’s room. It took me so long to figure out whose rooms everyone was in. I
don’t—I just, like—I know that we’ve all swapped—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Oh. Yeah. Andrew, appropriately, is in Dawn’s room.
[laughs]
Kristin: Yeah, but it’s like, everybody swapped rooms and the decor is, like, kinda
the same—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Yeah, yeah.
Kristin: But kinda different. And it used to be, in the older seasons, that I knew
where we were right away, but—
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Anyway. Spike is like, “You should make the knots tighter.”
Jenny: Can I just say…girl, you are a vampire slayer, and you’re using a couple
little pieces of rope—
Kristin: What are we doing?
Jenny: To tie Spike to a little chair made out of wooden matchsticks?
Kristin: What are we doing?
Jenny: [loudly] There are manacles in the basement, honey!
Kristin: Literally. It’s not like she’s a stranger to putting her re-ensouled boyfriend
vampire in chains! Why are we taking this detour?
Jenny: Oh! Is that where the manacles are from? Are they from Season 3, vamp
mansion?
Kristin: I don’t know. I mean, we’ve tangoed with, I think, a few sets of manacles.
Didn’t Oz have a set as well? [laughs]
Jenny: Oh, yeah. Yeah.


Kristin: Yeah, so I don’t know. But yeah, I thought the same thing. I mean, I didn’t
really think it until they were then putting him in chains. And I was like, why did we
not begin here? It’s not like they were forcing him to be constrained. He wanted it
just as much as them. It’s not like—you know?
Jenny: Yeah. Just—
Kristin: [simultaneously] Just make him comfy in the basement, in the chains.
Jenny: I mean, the tails of the rope are, like, long enough that I feel like if he
wriggled his wrist around, he could get at—like, it just—y’all.
Kristin: And he should have known, too. Like, he knows—he clearly—he delivers an
entire monologue later about what he’s capable of. He clearly must know that—
Jenny: The episode is short. Take your time! [both laugh] Secure this man! You
have the luxury of moments to spare. [both laugh]
Kristin: Alright, so. Credits.
Jenny: [sings Buffy theme]
Kristin: Oh, and then where do we go next, Jenny? How exciting to be here.
Jenny: To the principal’s office, Kristin!
Kristin: Mmm.
Jenny: Wood is threatening these kids with their permanent record. Please note,
one of these children is named Grimes.
Kristin: Oh! [laughs] You think that’s where, like, Grimes’ name came from?
Jenny: I don’t think so. [both laugh]
Kristin: I just wanna play a tiny little clip of music here, because when I hear
anyone talk about permanent records, all I think of is the Violent Femmes.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Oh boy, here we go.
[“Kiss Off” by Violent Femmes plays]
I hope you know that this will go down on your permanent record!


Oh, yeah? Well, don't get so distressed.
Did I happen…
Kristin: [sighs] I loved the Violent Femme—I love the Violent Femmes. But like,
particularly in this era and the, like, five to ten years prior. Boy did I love the
fucking Violent Femmes. [Jenny laughs] Alright. So…Wood is bluffing, and I love
this. I—this is an effective principal move, right? Just be honest. Not threatening to
call the police, not that part. But like, just the, “You know what, I was bluffing and
it’s so much work for me to deal with this bullshit. Can you fucking just do what I’m
asking you to do?” I feel like—
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: That’s a more effective way to deal with teenagers than, like, fake threats
and empty whatever. You know?
Jenny: I totally know. However. Knock-knock.
Kristin: Oh my god, why? Why?
Jenny: Rapping upon the principal’s door, it’s Dawn, letting Principal Wood know
that Buffy isn’t coming in today because she was vomiting, and then she was
vomiting some more, and then some additional vomiting. [laughing] And she
says—[Kristin laughs] she says, “Her exact words were…[both laugh] I’ve got stuff
coming out both ends.” And then Wood is—[laughs]
Kristin: It’s amaz—D.B. Woodside’s fucking acting in that mom—in that beat, just
his face, is so good. [laughs]
Jenny: Staring into the middle distance, cursing the day he decided to pursue…a
career—
Kristin: [simultaneously] [laughing] High school administration?
Jenny: In education. He says, “Thank you, that’s—” and does this incredible
half-squint that…I love so much [laughing] and says, “Very helpful.” [both laugh]
It’s really good. Not a ton of Wood in this episode, but he’s really making the most
of his time.
Kristin: Oh my god. Truly, truly he is. So. [laughs] Now that’s a scene that, like,
again, delightful, fun, a bit funny, whatever. But like, [laughs] if this was an issue


for time, that would have been the first thing to go. Because we don’t really need to
know that Buffy has gone—
Jenny: No, that rocks. It’s one of the best parts of the episode. [laughs]
Kristin: No, it’s great, but I’m just saying, like, content-wise—you know what I
mean? Like, I guess we wanna establish—
Jenny: [simultaneously] No, no, we’re looking to flesh this out, not cut it down.
Kristin: [laughs] Okay. Okay, excuse me, I’m sorry, I stand corrected. So, fucking
Buffy Summers gets on the phone and she’s like, 1-800, fucking, Councils-R-Us.
[Jenny laughs] And she’s calling Quentin’s direct line. Like, where is—
Jenny: This man is allergic to the truth!
Kristin: [laughs] Where is Quentin’s number written down? You know? Like, I just
wanna see it. I want—like, how does she have it? Is it—does it say “the Council”? Is
it—is it, like, a normal London number? Is it toll free?
Jenny: Mmm.
Kristin: Like, I wanna know more about how to call the Council.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Yeah, 1-800…have you or members of your community
experienced a vampire-related disturbance? We wanna hear your story. Please
call…[both laugh] do people call 1-800 in England or do they call…
Kristin: Oh.
Jenny: Something else?
Kristin: Shit. [laughing] I don’t know.
Jenny: Call 420-69…uh…vampires, what-what. [Kristin laughs] So Buffy’s like,
listen, pal. ‘Cause Quentin is like, “Giles? Never heard of him!” [laughs]
Kristin: So—but pause, because rewind back to earlier this season when Giles was,
like, going to this fucking meeting and this thing. And I was like, but what is he
fucking around with the Council for? That doesn’t make any sense. And he wasn’t,
so I don’t remember even what my references were from. But somebody will. He’s
talking about going on these, like, retreats and shit, but he’s not ‘cause…like, is


it—are we to believe that, like, Giles was doing something that we’re not supposed
to know, so he was lying about being around the Council? Because this is—
Jenny: Mmm.
Kristin: This makes more sense to me, that Giles has not been fucking around with
the Council, for a long time.
Jenny: I don’t know, it’s confusing!
Kristin: I know.
Jenny: Maybe he was going to non-Council retreats. Maybe he was gathering with
ex-Watchers. Maybe he’s just really tapped into a bunch of covens.
Kristin: Oh, ex-Watchers. That would be so nice for everyone. [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah. So Quentin is just like, deny, deny, deny.
Kristin: “You don’t need to get all British and dodgy,” says Buffy.
Jenny: True!
Kristin: [laughs] Basically, he gets off the phone and he’s like, “The girl—” why?
Why do you have to call her “the girl,” Quentin? [Jenny laughs] Stop it. “The girl
knows nothing and we need to find Rupert Giles as soon as possible!” Dun-dun-dun!
Jenny: Yes, he has helpfully added a bunch of what I can only assume to be search
rectangles onto a world map, Kristin. I’ve dropped a supporting photograph—
Kristin: Oh.
Jenny: Screenshot in the chat.
Kristin: Great.
Jenny: So you can see some of the areas he’s staked out.
Kristin: [laughs] Okay, so just to be really clear—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Here’s all the places—


Kristin: Jenny has sent me a photo of the map that Quentin is looking at. It is—
Jenny: Yes.
Kristin: Wow. Very special. Go ahead, talk about it, Jenny, please. [laughs]
Jenny: There are a lot of rectangles. Basically, the entirety of Western Europe? And
Great Britain? Are included.
Kristin: They’re all in at least one rectangle. [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Part of Africa. Most of Scandinavia. Big eastern
chunk of Russia.
Kristin: But like, there are places in—
Jenny: [simultaneously] What looks like [laughs] the southern tip of India. Got a
little Thailand, a little Malaysia/Indonesia business. [Kristin laughs] No—he’s
definitely not in Australia—
Kristin: No—
Jenny: It has been completely ruled out.
Kristin: Even though Australia is literally the one place they mention in the scene,
where they’re like—[both laugh] the, like, death toll or whatever has gone up
considerably—
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: In Australia. [laughs] So he’s like—
Jenny: Well, if they know what the casualties in Australia are, perhaps they also
received the “Giles isn’t here” intel on the same call. [both laugh] In the same fax.
Kristin: Right, right. So he’s about to take out his little mouse and, like, draw a
rectangle over all of Australia.
Jenny: Yes.
Kristin: [laughs] Probably, like, big enough to also cover some of, like, Antarctica?
Which is the one at the bottom?


Jenny: [laughs] Uh, yes. Yes—
Kristin: Yeah?
Jenny: Antarctica is down yonder.
Kristin: Great. Yeah, okay, so—yeah. Clearly these are smart—very smart people,
at the Council. They’re doing research. And we leave them, sadly finding nothing
out about the fate of Giles or anything about where Giles is. And we go to—
Jenny: Well. I mean, they’ve narrowed it down, Kristin. [Kristin laughs] Give them
some credit. [laughs]
Kristin: It’s true. He’s not in South Africa. And he’s not in Australia. [both laugh]
He doesn’t appear to be in China?
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Is that green land over there Iceland? He’s not there. He’s certainly not
there. [both laugh] Alright, anyway. Spike is going through withdrawals from all the
human blood that he has been ingesting. And Buffy, witnessing this, sort of, like,
sees Willow in the hallway. [laughing] And Buffy’s like, “We need blood.” And
Willow’s like, “Do you want me to kill Anya?” And it’s done very—comedically well.
Comedically well.
Jenny: But this is not where they are anymore.
Kristin: True. Anya is in the fold. Anya is in the fold and we love her, but it’s still a
funny joke. Willow still makes it land. And also, Buffy helps it land ‘cause Buffy
doesn’t even respond to it. Like, she’s like, well, no, I think we—[both laugh] I think
actually we should get animal blood instead. And then they have this really nice
moment together, you know, where Willow—
Jenny: Oh, yeah. Friends checking in.
Kristin: I love—I, like, love this and I think that probably this is, like, something
that will resonate for a lot of listeners. Of just—I’m a person who deflects, you
know? Like, when—a lot of people will say, like, how are you? Especially my
therapist, you know? Like, so how are you doing? And then, like, ten minutes later,
she’s like, okay, so can we come back to how are you doing? Like, I’ll like, answer
for everyone else and, like, [Jenny laughs] this—but this person is going through


this. And like, I understand why they did that because of X or whatever. So I just
felt like this was really nice, that Willow took this extra moment to, you know, just
show how much she knows Buffy, show how much she cares for Buffy, and redirect
her to say, like, I understand where Spike is at, but I’m asking about you. You
know? And Buffy, classic—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Is like, “I’ll be fine.” [laughs]
Jenny: And…they decide that Willow’s gonna go get some blood, some pig’s blood.
And she’s happy to do it because Xander is lecturing about tool maintenance while
he’s doing his carpentry. And this is the moment I mentioned earlier where, after
Willow says, like, “Xander keeps, like, lecturing me about tool maintenance.” It cuts
to Buffy. And it holds on this, like, very long reaction shot that just feels, like, a
little weird. And then there’s, like, a very obviously ADR’ed line from Willow where
she says, “Tool talk, not my thing.” Like…[Kristin laughs] that was so unnecessary.
And like, the way that Buffy reacts to it and that we’re holding—it just, like, feels a
little funny, which was the next brick in my two-brick wall of, damn! Did this
episode come in short or what? [laughs]
Kristin: Do you think that that was actually just, like, they tried to—they tried to,
like, stick a lesbian joke and they didn’t stick it well, so they had to just,
like—[laughs] like, tiptoe out the door?
Jenny: Mm. When has not landing a lesbian joke ever stopped…
Kristin: [laughs] You’re right.
Jenny: Non-lesbians from going for it? [both laugh]
Kristin: “Non-lesbians.” [laughs] You can identify sexuality as one of two things.
It’s a binary. Lesbian or non-lesbian.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kristin: Okay.
Jenny: I’m assuming—I’m just assuming that Drew Goddard and David Solomon
are not lesbians.


Kristin: Yeah. I think that’s safe. [laughs] So. Okay, so then we go to this
ridiculous scene, where fucking Warren the First is down here—like, are we to
believe that if the First, the First can be in many places at once? Or is the First just,
like, truly investing part of their afternoon in this pig comedy? Like, is that what
feels [Jenny snorts] the most important for the first, or—? [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah, I wonder if the First can do—can multitask.
Kristin: Right? I mean, I hope so. Because if not, then I would like to have a word
with the First. [laughs] About time management.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Well, the First is trying to accomplish a very clear goal
here.
Kristin: But of all the people in the world, just find somebody else to go to the
butcher. Find somebody to just fucking—what are doing?
Jenny: Mmm.
Kristin: You know?
Jenny: Mmm.
Kristin: Maybe it has to come out of a living thing, but still, really? Andrew? I
mean, thank you, ‘cause it gives us comedy. But it just feels a little under par for
evil. [laughs]
Jenny: This pig is cute.
Kristin: Oh my god, the pig is so cute. The pig is like, I fucking saw what happened
to Herbert. And I am fucking outta here! [both laugh] May Herbert be the last pig to
die at Sunnydale High School, [Jenny laughs] for fuck’s sake. So Warren’s like—it’s
like, stupid funny. And I’m here. I—like, I accept it. “Cut her deep. Cut her quick.”
[laughing] And Andrew’s like, “What if she squeals?” and Warren’s like, [Jenny
groans] “You’re right, cut her throat first.” And then, Andrew has a moment where
he reflects on Babe 2: Pig in the City being an underrated film. I have not—I don’t
think I’ve seen Babe 2: Pig in the City. I have seen Babe, of course. Who would I be
if I hadn’t seen Babe? But I don’t remember Pig in the City. I imagine that, you
know, Babe winds up in the city and all manner of hijinks happens. So perhaps we
should watch it. [laughs]
Jenny: I’ve never seen any movies in the Babeverse.


Kristin: Ohh.
Jenny: But—
Kristin: But you did the next pig reference, didn’t you?
Jenny: [laughs] Of course.
Kristin: Of course. As Andrew fucking launches himself [laughing] at this piglet, he
screams—it’s so funny! “That’ll do, pig!” as his whole small body flies across the
screen. [sighs] He says—
Jenny: Strange choice for a war cry. [laughs]
Kristin: Yeah, but it’s funny. He says twice in this episode, “I’m not very good at
stabbing.” He’s, like, really fixating on the fact that he’s just, like, really not good at
stabbing. You know? [both laugh]
Jenny: Buddy. We all have stuff we’re not good at.
Kristin: So, more comedy at the butcher’s—[laughs] I almost just said the
butcher’s office. I mean, I guess it is his office.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: [laughing] Andrew is like, “I’ll have twelve pork chops, two pounds of
sausage, [quickly] a quart of pig’s blood, [normal] and three steaks.” [both laugh]
Jenny: I feel like we see people buying blood at the butcher—
Kristin: All the time.
Jenny: A lot.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: And I can’t remember if we’ve ever thought to ask before if this is, like,
norm—like, if you can just get…blood. Don’t worry—


Kristin: You can. I think we have asked it, a long time ago. ‘Cause I feel like
there—like, I feel like I remember reading recipes that had blood in them, and
wishing that I had—that we hadn’t asked the question. [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: Like, doesn’t—isn’t there, like, a pudding of some kind that is clearly not
pudding, as we would consider it, but that is made of blood? And other things?
Jenny: Black pudding?
Kristin: Black pudding?
Jenny: Uh, I…that’s what I’m looking at somebody talking about really wanting to
make for themselves. And then going to a bunch of butchers and butchers telling
them that they can’t sell them blood. Hmmmm. There seems to be some
disagreement on the internet. And, um…apparently, we went down this road before,
so best to soldier on bravely.
Kristin: [simultaneously] I mean, this is a podcast about vampires. It only makes
sense that in six years, we would ponder twice what recipes—
Jenny: Twice.
Kristin: Require large quantities of blood—of animal blood. [laughs]
Jenny: Yeah, and where you can get said blood.
Kristin: So the butcher—okay. Let me get a tiny—I would like a scene of this
butcher’s life when he’s not behind the butcher counter. Because he legit calls
Andrew “Neo.” And I just am like, this dude—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: This dude went and saw The Matrix?
Jenny: So he—yeah, he saw The Matrix. [laughs]
Kristin: I love it.
Jenny: It’s also funny that Andrew orders pork chops, sausage, blood, steaks,
halibut, and toothpaste. And the butcher only bumps on “toothpaste.”


Kristin: Sometimes butchers have, like, a couple of fish around, right?
Jenny: [hums uncertainly] Do they?
Kristin: Just like a couple—a couple little guys, just in case you got somebody
coming over that doesn’t eat meat. And you’re like, ugh—
Jenny: [uncertain, high-pitched] Okay.
Kristin: [simultaneously] Gotta get a halibut for that guy. You know?
Jenny: Okay, alright.
Kristin: So, he has his paper bag full of all of his blood and all of his various meats.
And he turns around to leave the butcher shop and runs directly into Willow
Rosenberg—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Ugh.
Kristin: Dropping his groceries. The blood clearly placed at the top of the bag, all
comes out.
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: [laughs] And he runs into the alley—
Jenny: [simultaneously] How embarrassing.
Kristin: Screaming, “Don’t kill me! Warren did it!” [both laugh]
Jenny: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh my gosh, pleading for his safety. Maybe stay
away from, “also, Warren killed Tara, not me.”
Kristin: Oh my god. “You killed my best friend, so we’re even.” [laughs]
Jenny: Ooooogh.
Kristin: He tries to tell Willow that he’s good now. And she—[Jenny snorts] like, it
takes one second. He’s like, “I’m good now, I do very good things.” And Willow’s
like, “Then why do you have 400 bags of blood?” And he’s like…[both laugh] “I’m


bad.” Let’s, um—let’s hear this exchange between Willow and Andrew ‘cause it’s
really very good.
[Clip from episode plays]
Andrew: I am bad. I’m bad, I’m evil. But I’m protected by powerful forces,
forces you can’t even begin to imagine, little girl! If you harm me, you shall
know the wrath of he that is darkness and terror. Your blood will boil and you
will know true suffering. Stand down, she-witch, your defeat is at hand—
[hitting noise]
Willow: Shut your mouth. I am a she-witch. A very powerful she-witch.
Or…witch, as is more accurate. I’m not to be trifled with.
Andrew: But I—
Willow: I’m talking! Don’t interrupt me. Insignificant man.
Jenny: I am Willow! I am death! If you dare defy me, I will call down my fury,
exact fresh vengeance and make your worst fears come true! Okay.
Kristin: Yeah, that’s great. When I talked to Jenny about the sound clip, I was like,
do you want me to extend it through the end, or do you wanna do it? And she said,
I’ll do it. So. You’re all welcome for that.
Jenny: Mmm.
Kristin: [laughs] [sings] “There’s a she-witch in your closet!” You know? [both
laugh] So, okay. We go back to the Summers house and in walks Willow with
Andrew and is like, “Guess who I found buying massive amounts of blood at the
fucking butcher shop?” [laughing] And Andrew says to Xander, “You’ll get nothing
out of me, carpenter!” [Jenny sighs] And Xander’s like, “We’ll see about that.”
Jenny: Yeah, we’re having a special on tying people to chairs today.
Kristin: Oh my god. Two for one. Two for one.
Jenny: My number one favorite thing that happens is Andrew says, “Careful with
the coat,” [Kristin laughs] and Anya says, “Oh, is it new?” and drops it on the
ground and steps on it with her little shoe.


Kristin: This is, like—I feel like Emma Caulfield and Tom Lenk had to have the
fucking best time together, in anything they got to do together. Because they are
both just so funny. And I feel like if you’re an actor that has, like, really great
comedic timing, it has to be a joy to work with somebody else—it’s just like—it just
feels like they’re having, oh, so much fun.
Jenny: Yeah. Yeah.
Kristin: So she—[laughing] yeah, she stomps all over his coat. He tries to explain
the blood away by saying he met a beautiful vampire girl in Mexico, and they’re
trying to clean up their acts and get their lives together.
Jenny: Yeah…
Kristin: Um, then Anya—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Anya’s like, “This is not a game!” and slaps him across the
face. [both laugh]
Kristin: First of all, she also says “junior” and later, she calls him “pipsqueak.” And
all of her nicknames for Andrew are my favorite, especially pipsqueak. [Jenny
laughs] Yeah, she does, she knocks him out. And Xander’s like, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. So we think—we think that, like, Xander’s gonna be like, you
know, maybe—maybe, like, don’t punch him. We don’t wanna hurt him. Or I don’t
know what you think Xander’s gonna do, but instead, it becomes very clear very
quickly that Xander and Anya may not be suited for marriage, but they are suited
for inquisitions—
Jenny: Teamwork!
Kristin: Yeah. Teamwork. They’re like you and me, Jenny.
Jenny: I know!
Kristin: We weren’t suited for marriage but we were suited to talk about Buffy the
Vampire Slayer together. [laughs]
Jenny: Look at us go. While Buffy is busy—
Kristin: Ugh!
Jenny: Feeding Spike from a little blood bag—bleghhh!


Kristin: My location is just “ew” for that little mini-scene. [Jenny laughs] Why did
they have to make it look like this? Like, they could—
Jenny: Unknown.
Kristin: We’ve seen them put blood in a cup and use a straw. And it is so much
preferred to this, like—it just looks like a boob. It looks like he’s, like, nursing on a
blood boob [Jenny laughs] and I fucking hate it. It’s so gross. So, before we get this
longer scene between Buffy and Spike, Buffy pops into—love a bathroom with two
entrances. You know, this is like an upstairs of a house—
Jenny: [laughs] I do not! This is a danger zone.
Kristin: I—well, but for TV. For like, television and movie purposes—
Jenny: Sure.
Kristin: Like, a house with two stairways or, like, a bathroom with two entrances. It
usually just makes for fun scenes. So Buffy pops in and is like, “How’s it going with
your guy?” [laughing] And Anya’s like, “The weasel wants to sing.” And Xander
goes, “He’s primed. I’ll be pumping him in no time.” And then there’s a very long
pause. [both laugh] Cool.
Jenny: Well. I had a whole little bit about how I was making my way through an
ancient temple ruin [Kristin laughs] in the middle of a jungle, searching for an
ancient artifact. In fact, a very important novella. And I finally come across it, deep
in the heart of the ruin. But oh no, it’s on a pressure-sensitive plate. I heft a bag of
sand in my hand [both laughing] to make sure it’s the same weight as the tome.
Kristin: Like, you’re all thinking you’re getting the best of it. But I’m the one who
gets to see her stupid fucking hand bobbing up and down with an imaginary bag of
sand in it, as she does this shit, okay? [both laugh] [pause] You done? Are you—
Jenny: With the reflexes of jaguar [pronounced jag-you-are]—
Kristin: Jag-you-are?
Jenny: That’s right. [both laughing]
Kristin: What are you, Andrew? [both laugh] Okay.


Jenny: I deftly snatch up the tome and [laughing] simultaneously place the bag of
sand down on the pressure-sensitive plate. I open to the center of the book, and
what does it say but, “He’s primed! I’ll be pumping him in no time.” Quoth Kristin
Russo!
Kristin: When people listen back to this episode, they’re gonna be like, were they
filling for time? It seems like…[both laugh] alright, so. Now to more serious
conversations. Buffy and Spike. He’s explaining his experience. “I don’t really
remember, I’m just seeing flashes. I’ve been losing time since I came back.” And he
sort of thinks—like, this is really kind of nice—a nice set up. Because it does make
sense that Spike might attribute some of the weird, fucked-up shit that’s been
happening to the fact that he legit got his soul back, you know? Like, it does—I
think it’s plausible that he would be, like, reasoning some of it away. And just
thinking that—
Jenny: Yeah. He’s clearly been having a time—
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Apart from what the First has been up to.
Kristin: Yeah. We learn that he didn’t know the chip wasn’t working still, which is
interesting—is that, like, it was in his psyche enough that it didn’t even need to be
working for him to feel like he couldn’t hurt people, kind of a deal. Because, like, we
saw him punch Xander and, like, be in enormous amounts of pain. So—
Jenny: I think that he actually is experiencing pain when he is consciously Spike
and hurting people, like punching Xander. I think when he is—when the sleeper
agent within him is triggered, the same power that is controlling—
Kristin: Him controls the chip?
Jenny: [simultaneously] His consciousness is also preventing him from
experiencing that neurological pain. I think.
Kristin: [simultaneously] Right. But then that dialogue—if that’s the truth, then
that dialogue is written a little weird. ‘Cause she says, “When did the chip stop
working?” and he just says, “I wasn’t aware that it had, until now.”
Jenny: “I wasn’t aware that it had.” Like—
Kristin: Yeah, okay. Alright.


Jenny: I mean, with a basement full of bodies as proof—
Kristin: Right. Right. Okay. So then, Buffy asks him how he got his soul back. She’s
doing a great job. Like, you know, this whole idea that she’s needing to get closer
to Spike to get closer to whatever this thing is. Like, turns out it was a pretty good
idea, because she’s asking a lot of really important questions. And by the end of the
episode, has put it all together to kind of come to a conclusion. So—
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Just A-plus for Buffy on that plan. And yeah, he sort of talks about how it
was—there were a lot of trials that he had to go to, but like, the pain and the
suffering was nothing compared to how he’s felt since he’s fallen in love with Buffy.
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: And then they have what I think is a really interesting exchange, yeah?
Jenny: Yeah, definitely interesting. Spike says, “You used me.” And then he says,
“You told me that, of course, but I never understood it until now. You hated yourself
and you took it out on me.” And he says that having a soul has allowed him to
understand self-loathing.
Kristin: Yeah, which is—like, that is an interesting point. I mean, we’ll get further
into this when they, like, continue basically this idea in conversation later. But—
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: It is sort of like—we’ve been talking a lot about, like, what the hell is a
soul? And like, why does it mat—like, why does it matter? You can hurt people and
do really bad things with a soul and what have you. And I think that this is just
more underlining of like, you know, when Spike, when Angelus—when they are
vampires with no souls, they do horrible things but they feel fucking great about it.
[laughs] They don’t—there’s no—
Jenny: Yeah. They’re just like, wassup! [laughs]
Kristin: [simultaneously] There is just no—it’s more of a conscience than a soul.
It’s like—it’s just sort of like having a moral compass of some kind or feeling the
consequences of your actions.


Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: And so Spike is trying to say that he understands that weight. But he
applies that in ways that are a little heavy handed, which Buffy will correct him on
later.
Jenny: Mmhmm. Okay, so good cop Harris comes in with a glass of water. [Kristin
laughs] Untying Andrew’s hands, apologizing for Anya hitting him. And he’s like,
“Listen, you gotta watch out for that one, you know, she's a vengeance demon,”
trying to put some fear in Andrew’s heart. And Andrew’s like, “One time I saw her
having sex with Spike.”
Kristin: [laughs] And then Xander’s like, “Let me tell you what she’s capable of.”
[laughs] And at first—at least for me, at first I was like, is he gonna struggle and,
like—you know, ‘cause they do this thing on the show a lot where it’s like, they will
try to say something that’s really bad. But they’re awkward and they mess it up and
it’s funny. And it becomes really clear really quickly that he’s just talking about
himself. And he’s like, “She did this thing to this guy one time where she, like, took
out his heart and then replaced it with darkness. [laughing] But he, like, still had to
go to work and talk to his friends all the time.” And I’m like, dude.
Jenny: My dude.
Kristin: Perhaps we should review the order of events. Because I don’t—I don’t—I
mean, it’s like, funny, but—
Jenny: We’re not impressed.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Andrew’s not impressed.
Kristin: No.
Jenny: Xander quickly course-corrects and is like, “Ah, but then she tore out his
intestines and rubbed ‘em in his face and took pictures of it!”
Kristin: [simultaneously] And took a picture! [both laugh] I love that taking a
picture of it was, like, part of the evil. Like—[laughs]
Jenny: Yeah.


Kristin: Yeah, he’s like, “The girls all need someone to blame, so like, you know,
watch out, man.” And Anya, hearing Andrew say that, like, he hasn’t done anything
wrong or whatever the fuck he says, comes flying into the room. “You lying son of
a—!” [both laugh] And—
Jenny: Throwing him out of the chair, slapping Xander clean across the face.
Kristin: This is—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Their…reactions. [laughs]
Kristin: This is the peak of comedy from Emma Caulfield for me, is this moment,
where—[laughs] she’s looking at Xander and so dramatically, she just mouths “I’m
sorry.” [both laugh] It’s really good. I love the two—I love—I would have loved a
buddy cop spinoff—
Jenny: [simultaneously] And his little “ow!” face.
Kristin: Here from Anya and Xander. They do a great job together.
Jenny: Yeah. Buffy comes in to investigate and is like, “Everything okay?” Frozen in
their assault poses. [both laugh] They’re like, “Yes, thank you. Everything’s fine.”
Kristin: Oh, it’s very good. And unfortunately, before Buffy gets this beautiful
tableau, when she closes the door to her room, we find out, uh-oh! Spike #2 is
here, behind the door, looking very evil.
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: And he says, “We’ve got ourselves a problem.” So when Buffy returns to
the door, she hears Spike talking to himself inside, and singing again. We get the
little—
Jenny: Mmhmm!
Kristin: Clips of this song. And she walks in. She’s like, “So…what the fuck? Are
you okay?” And he’s like, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I’m…totally fine.”
Jenny: Cool as a cucumber.
Kristin: Just feeling a little peckish. A word I do love. I love the word peckish. No?


Jenny: Mm…
Kristin: You don’t like it?
Jenny: I don’t like it.
Kristin: Okay.
Jenny: You can have it. It’s yours.
Kristin: Okay, great, I’ll keep it. Buffy goes to get the blood. And Spike, as
previously mentioned, snaps the chair of little toothpicks, like what they are—
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: And—[laughs] the—let me say something. The vampire growls have been
getting more intense as the seasons have gone on.
Jenny: Just plain lion roars.
Kristin: Just fully the MGM lion. [laughs] Like, fully—
Jenny: It’s really a lot.
Kristin: Just—a very big roar from Spike here.
Jenny: Spike basically just gets Buffy out of the way. He’s not trying to, like—
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Explicitly attack her. He’s just trying to get through her.
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: He…jams his arms through the fucking wall!
Kristin: Where are the studs?
Jenny: Uh, well one of them [Kristin laughs] has his arms through the fucking wall!
Kristin: I gave you that. That was like a—whatever you call it in basketball. A
layup.


Jenny: Yeah. This is perhaps a poorly-constructed house, I don’t know.
Kristin: [laughs] I mean, it just, like—you’d think—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Seems like there’s—yeah.
Kristin: [simultaneously] I mean, not that Spike can’t break a stud. I just
didn’t…[laughs] I just didn’t see any wood. I saw only drywall.
Jenny: Yeah. Yeah.
Kristin: And certainly the span of Spike’s arms coming through the wall was larger
than the common 16 inches between studs in a house, so. [both laugh] So anyway.
Andrew—right before Andrew gets pulled through the wall, which is so fucking
funny. It’s so fucking funny when the arm comes through the wall. It’s great. He
says, “The seal of Danzal-thorpe.” And then—[Jenny snorts] that’s what it is, I’m
sorry. It’s—
Jenny: Okay.
Kristin: I’m making it stick. Spike bites Andrew. And Buffy gets Spike off of
Andrew. And you see Spike—well, there’s two Spikes in the room at this point. You
see real Spike on the ground, looking very dazed.
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: And Buffy, like, checks on Andrew to make sure he’s, you know, alive or
whatever. And then promptly kicks Spike in the face to knock him out.
Jenny: Oh, yeah. Ohh, yeah.
Kristin: So. Down in the living room. Oh, man. I can’t even believe—I know we’re
not even there yet. But I’m just, like—every time I think about the living room and
how they just fixed it, I just get so upset. You know? [both laugh] They just—they
just—Xander’s been measuring that window for at least 45 minutes straight. And it’s
just gonna break again. How many times does that—does anyone have a count?
We’ve got some of you keeping tallies over here. Anybody know how many times
this bay window has broken? Because it’s just so many times. [Jenny laughs] It’s so
many.


Jenny: Oh yeah, I was noticing in the opening scene, when they’re having their
conversation about, like, “Why aren’t we killing Spike?” As they’re putting the living
room back together and, like, dusting their Summers trinkets and whatnots. They
have, like, some animal statuettes and little bit of this, little bit of that. But then
there’s just, like, a tiny chest of drawers that is too small—like, the drawers are too
small to hold anything larger than, like, I don’t know—[Kristin laughs] each drawer
could hold, like, a couple of Post-It note…pads/
Kristin: Mmm. What about some crystals? Maybe it was where Willow used to keep
her crystals.
Jenny: Okay, it could be the crystal—the mini crystal chest. Sure.
Kristin: [simultaneously] You know, quartz—quartz-based crystals on the top.
Jenny: Sure.
Kristin: You know, metal-based crystal—I don’t know, guys.
Jenny: [laughing] What?
Kristin: [laughs] I was just thinking about, like…what’s that silver crystal? That
looks very silver? Like, that—I don’t even know if there’s a such thing as a
quartz-based crystal. I was just picturing crystals that are, like, amethyst—
Jenny: Ohh.
Kristin: Rose quartz and…um…what have you versus something like a malachite or
a—
Jenny: Sure.
Kristin: Lapis lazuli?
Jenny: [simultaneously] Hematite.
Kristin: What are those? What are those based out of? I know—just so everyone
listening knows—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Lapis lazuli is—


Kristin: [simultaneously] I know lapis lazuli [pronounced la-zoo-lee], if that’s how
you say it—that’s how I say it in my mind. But I know that because it was, like, a
very important stone in the Vampire Diaries books. So…
Jenny: [quietly] Oh my god.
Kristin: I don’t know anything about the show, really, but I know that I remember
it from the books.
Jenny: I, in high school, weirdly worked at an expensive pen store for about a year.
Kristin: Yeah, I know this about you.
Jenny: But perhaps the listeners don’t. Maybe I’ve talked about it before. But the
most expensive pen that I ever sold to someone who had way too much money, if
this is what they were spending that amount of money on a pen. [laughs]
Kristin: How much money?
Jenny: Uh, I think it was around $1200.
Kristin: Wow, for a pen.
Jenny: And it was made of, you know, gold and the way that I thought it was
pronounced, lapis lazuli [pronounced: la-zoo-lie] was the inlay.
Kristin: Sounds much nicer.
Jenny: If you are part of our—what I assume is our vast gem-ologist listenership.
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: Could you let us know if either one of us is saying it right? We’d love to
know.
Kristin: I mean, let’s be real. Like, lapis lazuli is how me and the mom from Bob’s
Burgers say it. You know what I mean? Like, that—
Jenny: Yeah, it does feel like the Long—the regional Long Island pronunciation.
[laughs]


Kristin: [simultaneously] [laughs] Yeah. But like, “and then she went to the store,
she got some pizza and some lapis lazuli? Yeah, it was good. It was a good time.”
Jenny: Oh, man. [Kristin laughs] Yeah, when you put it like that, it’s real.
Kristin: [laughs] Anyway. I’m glad we solved the biggest mystery of this episode,
which is what do they keep in the tiny drawers? [laughs]
Jenny: Cool.
Kristin: So anyway, down in the living room, they’re like, you know, breaking it all
down. “It seemed like Spike didn’t want anything to do with me,” Buffy says. Dawn:
“How’s what’s-his-name?” We’ll get another press of that “no one knows who
Andrew is” button later. She says, “When I got back, it was like he was a different
person. [laughs] He was singing.” Anya—
Jenny: Uh-oh.
Kristin: “Maybe it’s another musical. A much crappier musical.” [Jenny laughs] I
love you. Also, your hair looks so good. Xander brings up this idea of a trigger, and
I rolled my eyes and I was like, I cannot believe that they’re going to use this
fucking army shit again. I was so annoyed. And then, apparently, the writers—
Jenny: And then they didn’t! [laughs]
Kristin: Also felt the same way, because they took a moment to have Willow be
like, “Is this an army thing?” and he was like, “Nah, it’s just from all the movies I
watch.”
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Phew. Saved.
Jenny: Okay, so they’ve got some plans. Dawn and Willow are gonna research
what entities could be haunting slash controlling in this way. Xander and Anya are
gonna research how to deactivate a trigger.
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: Great.
Kristin: Great.


Jenny: Everything, I’m sure, is gonna be fine.
Kristin: Great.
Jenny: Meanwhile, at the high school—
Kristin: Whaaat!
Jenny: [simultaneously] Wood is wrapping up for the night. And man, I would just
never wanna be the last person in this building at night—
Kristin: No.
Jenny: You know what I mean?
Kristin: But I think he does explicitly want to be the last person in the building.
Jenny: Yeah, that might be…so he’s just walking down the hallway when he catches
a vibe [Kristin laughs] by the old basement “no student access” door. You know the
one.
Kristin: I know the one. Oh, down he goes, directly—
Jenny: He makes his way—
Kristin: Just, like, does not need directions to the Seal of Danzal-thorpe, at all.
Jenny: Directly to the Seal of Hot Topic. And—
Kristin: Sees Jonathan. No shock there. We’ll see him—
Jenny: Yep.
Kristin: Fucking burying that body, shortly. There’s a lot of dirt—they needed a lot
of dirt from the props department this season. [both laugh] You know? We don’t
often see this much digging and, like, burying of bodies—
Jenny: Mmm.
Kristin: In Buffy the Vampire Slayer. So Spike is now in chains in the basement.
Buffy’s cleaning his face off. I’m nervous. Like, I am having, like, PTSD of fake


Buffy. So like, this whole episode that I’m watching, every time Buffy does anything
nice, I’m like, it’s not her! It’s not her! But it’s literally just her the whole time.
[laughs]
Jenny: ‘Cause you think it’s the Buffybot?
Kristin: No, no! Because I think it’s, like, the Buffy manifestation of the First.
Jenny: Oh, right.
Kristin: You know?
Jenny: Well, the First couldn’t be cleaning his wounds.
Kristin: Right, ‘cause the First is not corporeal. Right. But I still just panic—like,
what—the minute that she was sitting there and she had, like, changed out of
whatever she had been wearing into, like, a sexier, black top, I was like, not real!
Jenny: Uh-oh.
Kristin: Evil Buffy, that’s evil Buffy! But it’s not.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kristin: She just was wearing a sexy black top.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Evil, sexier Buffy. [both laugh]
Kristin: Yeah, the show has effectively made me associate sexiness with evil. Great
job, everyone.
Jenny: Mm.
Kristin: [laughs] So—
Jenny: More appropriate level of restraints being used.
Kristin: Yes.
Jenny: Manacles in effect.


Kristin: He’s like, “Did I hurt anyone?” And she’s like, “You took a good chunk out
of Andrew.” We get a brief comedy beat. “Who?” “Tucker’s brother.” “Hmm.”
Jenny: Why does he know who Tucker is?
Kristin: Everybody knows who Tucker is.
Jenny: Well.
Kristin: The prom was a big deal.
Jenny: Okay. Okay. [laughs]
Kristin: So Xander has a theory. And it is, you know, that you have this, like,
trigger, basically, and that it’s making you do these things. And Spike is like, “You
have to kill me.”
Jenny: Immediately.
Kristin: This is really rough. Because Spike is [Jenny groans] really trying to get
Buffy to kill him. He’s basically like, “Do you have any idea what I’m capable of?
You’ve never met the real me.” And it’s kind of like Spike has also never met the
real him. Because he’s never had to hold the atrocities that he’s done in this mind.
And—
Jenny: Right.
Kristin: Yeah, he says, I—like, I—we don’t need to go—you wanna hear it, you can
listen to him say it. But it’s really bad. And he talks about really, really atrocious
and disturbing, horrible things that he’s done. And Buffy’s just like, “No. I’m not.
Like, I’m not doing it.” And then he takes this seed that he planted earlier, of like, I
understand that you feel really shitty about yourself and that’s, like, why you’re
using me. And he takes it and he applies it to this situation and he’s like, “Have you
asked yourself why you have not killed me yet? Because I know why. And don’t
rationalize with me about it. Like, you like men who hurt you because you need the
pain and you need the hatred to do your job.” No. No, sir. Incorrect.
Jenny: Buffy says she doesn’t hate like that, not anymore.
Kristin: Anymore. Right. Right. Well, and I don’t—I mean, we know—but like, I
think Spike is trying to, like, paint one big brush over, like, specifically probably
Angel and himself. You know?


Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: And that is not the case. Like, Angel, to Buffy, is something totally
different. I mean, Angel is first love material. Buffy is still a very new Slayer at this
point. She does not have the—I mean, she has the weight of the world on her
shoulders when she’s with Angel. But [laughs] little did she know that she would
have the weight of 400 worlds on her shoulders, you know, by the time she gets to
Season 6.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Mm. Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Kristin: And so I don’t think you can hold those two things together as, like,
evidence of why she makes the choices she makes. And so when she says that she
doesn’t do that anymore, I think she’s specifically just referring to Season 6 and
what she did with him and—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: You know, she did hate herself. And so deeply so, and just was so
disgusted and overwhelmed with the world. But we’ve seen her—I mean, you know,
I don’t know that you ever completely heal from that. But she has definitely, like,
healed a lot from that time. And she says some really powerful stuff to Spike,
explaining where she is now and why she’s not killing him now.
[Clip from episode plays]
Buffy: You’re not alive because of hate or pain. You’re alive because I saw
you change. Because I saw your penance.
[chains rattle]
Spike: Window dressing.
Buffy: It’d be easier, wouldn’t it? If it were an act? But it’s not. You faced the
monster inside of you and you fought back. You risked everything to be a
better man.
Spike: Buffy—
Buffy: And you can be. You are. You may not see it, but I do. I do. I believe
in you, Spike.


Jenny: And this is so great. Except oh no, the timing! The timing is so bad,
because a bunch of men in robes bust into the house.
Kristin: Oh my god. And like, I—
Jenny: Don’t they understand that a moment is being had?
Kristin: They don’t care, Jenny. They don’t care about that, they don’t care about
the fact that they clearly must have known that those windows just got fixed. They
didn’t have [Jenny laughs] to break them! They could have just come through the
door! Like—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Use. The door. Well, they do come through the door, as
well. [both laugh]
Kristin: You know? Just for goodness sake.
Jenny: But that’s another thing, etiquette. If one of you is going to break the
just-replaced—
Kristin: Yes.
Jenny: Picture window, have the decency for all of you to come through one broken
window.
Kristin: And you know they don’t lock the door, that goes into the kitchen. Just
open it!
Jenny: No. They’ve never locked a door in their fucking lives.
Kristin: Never! Never! Oh, god. So all these, like, eyeless ninjas fucking roll
through the Summers house. And meanwhile, Wood is, one scoop at a time,
burying Jonathan, so we’ll have to put a—
Jenny: [simultaneously] [laughing] One scoop at a time.
Kristin: Fucking pin in that, because that’s troublesome. Dawn is kicking—
Jenny: Yeah, you like her little…?
Kristin: Ugh, that elbow throw that she does? She—


Jenny: Yeah, you like her little roll backwards, where she—
Kristin: Yes!
Jenny: Kick-tosses that guy into the wall?
Kristin: Amazing fight sequence here. Because Dawn—in my opinion, Dawn wins
‘cause, you know, she’s not a Slayer and I think she pulls some incredible moves
out. But also, we get Buffy fighting with Andrew. Like, using Andrew’s entire body
to knock these guys to the side. [both laugh] Which is so good. The—I don’t know if
you noticed this, Jenny, but while the fighting is happening in the living room, we
get a clear shot of the wall where, episodes ago, Dawn had accidentally
crossbow’ed a hole. And the hole is there.
Jenny: Oh, nice.
Kristin: [simultaneously] Dawn’s crossbow hole is there, and I just wanna—
Jenny: Oh!
Kristin: Give a nod to the—
Jenny: I celebrate that continuity.
Kristin: Yes, that’s great.
Jenny: Yet to be spackled.
Kristin: [laughs] Xander saves Dawn in a really nice move as well. Everybody is
really showing up to this fight.
Jenny: Yes, and then we get a little double knife stabby-stab.
Kristin: Wow. And those knives are curved! So.
Jenny: [simultaneously] The Summers classic. They are so curved.
Kristin: So curved. Why is a knife—like, what is the effectiveness of a curved knife
over a straight knife? Because clearly, they serve different purposes. And I—


Jenny: Well, I’m thinking…just, you know, spitballing here. I’m not a—I’m not very
good at stabbing either. [Kristin laughs] But thinking about a curved dagger—
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: Right? You’re going in, but you’re not just making a straight puncture. You
imagine the blade is curving up—
Kristin: [simultaneously] So maybe you have, like, a higher—higher odds of hitting
something that you wanna hit? Like a heart or an artery?
Jenny: And it’s probably harder to heal.
Kristin: Right.
Jenny: Like—okay, so like, triangular blades—you know, like…if you were looking
at, like, the—if you were looking at a knife directly head-on—
Kristin: Uh-huh.
Jenny: And the blade was slightly triangular—
Kristin: Okay.
Jenny: That design is specifically engineered to make a wound harder to close.
Kristin: Ohhh.
Jenny: Right? And harder to heal. So that you have a higher—even if you don’t kill
somebody right away, you have a higher chance of them bleeding out or dying from
an infection or whatever.
Kristin: I see.
Jenny: I’m thinking a curved knife kind of does some of the same stuff.
Kristin: Okay.
Jenny: Maybe.


Kristin: Yeah. That makes sense. I mean, like, if you think about the human body,
if you have a straight knife, there are many places that you could go straight
through and not hit an organ. But like—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: If you’re going up—in and up, then yeah, the odds of you hitting
something good, or bad, however we’re looking at it, is higher. Higher?
Jenny: Professional knife-ologists—
Kristin: Mmhmm. Is that—[inaudible]
Jenny: Kristin Russo and Jenny Owen Youngs, reporting for duty.
Kristin: Yeah—
Jenny: No wound too inscrutable.
Kristin: [laughs] So. They basically kick the shit out of all these guys. And then
realize, at the end, that was the fucking point. And they just wanted to distract
them all so they could get Spike.
Jenny: Nooooooo!
Kristin: Buffy sees one of them on the ground and this is when she, like—the giant
Buffy lightbulb is going off.
Jenny: Yeah. She’s like, “I. Have. Fought. This. Before!” [Kristin laughs] These
dudes with the knives, Spike’s ghosts, the people you all saw—
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: From beneath us—FBU! [Kristin laughs] It’s all the same thing. It’s the
First!
Kristin: Whoa.
Jenny: From Amends! “Am I a righteous man?!” [Kristin laughs] Am I?!


Kristin: He’s still working it out, man. He’s still working it out. [laughs] [Jenny
sighs] So. That’s a big deal. That’s a big deal. And you know who else thinks it’s a
big deal is the fucking Council, because—
Jenny: Uh-oh. Uh-oh!
Kristin: [simultaneously] Wow. It’s like—[Jenny laughs] it’s like a fucking trade
floor when the stock market is crashing over there. You know what I mean? People
are buzzing around.
Jenny: Things are hectic. Also, England hasn’t become any less grainy [Kristin
laughs] in the exterior shots, since last episode.
Kristin: [simultaneously] It’s their grainy season, okay? It’s their grainy season.
The communications are out. Lydia is concerned. And he’s like, “Lydia, my darling,
don’t worry.”
Jenny: Mwah-mwah-mwah!
Kristin: “Still master of our fate and captains of our souls!” Okay. “The First Evil
has declared war on this institution. It is time that we struck back.” He says, “Get
confirmations on all remaining operatives. Get them here. Prepare for mobilization.
We will be going to the Hellmouth.” Spoiler alert.
Jenny: No, they won’t. RIP Council headquarters. Quentin Travers. Lydia.
Kristin: Good thing Giles wasn’t there!
Jenny: Good thing. But where is he? So many unexplored rectangles remain…in
play.
Kristin: [simultaneously] Jenny, I have told you a thousand times if I’ve told you
once, he is not in central Russia or Australia!
Jenny: [laughs] Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. [Kristin laughs] Back at the seal.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Spike is lashed up like the Vitruvian Man.
Kristin: Yeah, like, I don’t like torture, but this device is cool.


Jenny: If you’re gonna do it, get Vitruvian. I guess.
Kristin: The First is like, I’m a sucker for old classics. And like, I am too. Not
necessarily in torture devices, but like, you know. I love an old fashioned thing, and
this thing is just—like, if it weren’t torturing Spike and bleeding him out, I just think
it’s a cool little…gear…circle, wooden, fucking cranky-crank thing. You know?
Jenny: I do know. Spike is to be bled.
Kristin: Mmm. They really do these cuts in a very precise way.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Here’s a question.
Kristin: Mm.
Jenny: Why—why not just have the robes put the blood on the seal to begin with?
Kristin: Like, the guys that attacked? Those guys?
Jenny: Yeah, they’re bleeding Spike out now. Why did the First lure Andrew and
Jonathan to the seal?
Kristin: Right.
Jenny: Although now that I’m thinking about it, I think there might be an answer
waiting for us. So pretend I didn’t say that.
Kristin: Okay. Yeah, so the First is like, “I was gonna bleed—” the First is now in
the form of Buffy, that’s important to note. And she’s like, “I was going to bleed out
Andrew, but you look a lot better shirtless.” [laughs]
Jenny: Mmm!
Kristin: So is the evil—the First Evil bisexual?
Jenny: Uh…
Kristin: Canonically, it seems as such.
Jenny: Uhh…
Kristin: Evil said—


Jenny: [simultaneously] I mean, I think a lot of things about the First Evil are very
fluid.
Kristin: Evil said, gender is not a binary and everyone is gay—
Jenny: [simultaneously] That’s right.
Kristin: Dot com.
Jenny: Evil also said, “Wanna see what a real vampire looks like?”
Kristin: [laughs] No! We all collectively scream, no! We don’t.
Jenny: [simultaneously] Nobody wants to—no. Unsubscribe!
Kristin: Don’t show us, please don’t show us. [laughs]
Jenny: Oh, but unfortunately, show us they must. Because the seal—
Kristin: No…
Jenny: Has its little foldy bits, and opens up, and from the depths emerges…your
friend and mine, Camden Toy. [Kristin laughs] Lookin’ like Nosfaratu. Uh, doing his
little Gnarl fingers.
Kristin: Oh my god, his fingers are so long. They’re so fucking long. I just wanna
see him—I know you don’t watch Euphoria, Jenny, but there was an incredible
scene with the characters of Maddy and Cassie a couple episodes ago, where Maddy
is really angry and she is fucking clacking her nails, man. It’s so good, it’s so
effective, it’s so delicious. And I would just like to see this old fucker do that same
move. I just wanna see him clack his fucking nails in somebody’s face, you know?
Jenny: Ohh.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: Kinda like Gnarl?
Kristin: No—well, no. Gnarl clacked the nails of one hand together. That's a
different situation.


Jenny: Okay.
Kristin: This is both hands clacking together—
Jenny: Oh, I see.
Kristin: Like you’re getting in someone’s face and you’re like, making—you know. I
mean, you know from me—
Jenny: Clack, clack, clack! [laughs]
Kristin: As an Italian, when I’m fucking emphatic, I’m like, kinda doing this shit
with my hands.
Jenny: Uh-huh, yes.
Kristin: So if I had long fucking nails, they’d be fucking clacking right in your little
face, and that’s what I wanna see this—
Jenny: [simultaneously] Clickety-clack. Okay.
Kristin: Yeah. That’s what I wanna see this guy do.
Jenny: I see.
Kristin: [laughing] I also just wanna say that the closed captions—it’s just like,
“men chanting in Latin.” And then you cut to the next fucking screen and it’s this
fucker. Which I just feel like—[both laugh]
Jenny: He also is, like, taking their—I don’t know if this is their, like, milking for
time again or what. [Kristin laughs] But the Ubervamp has its arms outstretched.
Somehow, the seal opened, this guy came out, and then the seal closed ‘cause now
he’s, like, on it or right next to it.
Kristin: Right.
Jenny: It’s a sealed-off situation now. His arms are out, his palms are outstretched,
and he’s staring, like, up and kind of, like, hiss-roaring. You know? And he’s all
[hisses]—[Kristin laughs] and it’s like, they’re in a basement. Like, the ceilings are
not that high. I’m kinda curious about, like, what are you looking up towards?
What’s your motivation? What’s going on, buddy? [Kristin laughs] What are you
doing?


Kristin: Oh god. Well. Here we are. And Spike’s like, “Well, fuck.” [laughs] Spike is
like, I am so glad that I am a young vampire. [both laugh] And somebody better kill
me quick if that’s what’s gonna happen to me later.
Jenny: Mmhmm.
Kristin: Wow, so. Yeah. Well, I mean, nothing like a fucking growling, weird,
long-fingered, ancient vampire to usher us into [laughing] the Sexual Tension
Awards.
Jenny: Yes! Speaking of fingers for days. [Kristin laughs]
[SEXUAL TENSION AWARD jingle plays]
Sexual tension award!
Jenny: Well! Welcome back to another installment of the Sexual Tension Awards!
Where we have four slots, and usually approximately eight noms, and we jam them
in accordingly.
Kristin: Mmhmm, you know, you’re gonna have some trouble jamming some of
these, Jenny, ‘cause some of ‘em are incorporeal, so good luck. [laughs]
Jenny: Yes, my jamming fingers will pass right through them. [both laugh] In slot
number one, I feel like it’s been a while since we had a fun new ship name. Xander
and Andrew: Xandrew!
Kristin: Xandrew, thank you. I was gonna say Xandrew, I’m glad you did.
Jenny: A little good cop, bad cop.
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: You know—
Kristin: One of them is backstabbing and the other one is good at probing. You
know what I mean?
Jenny: Wow! [both laugh] Okay, let me submit my resignation really quick. In slot
number two! Ohh, it’s gonna be hard to make sure these stay put, these two noms
in this little slot. [Kristin laughs] But the tension is high as we referenced before,
novellas a-flying off—


Kristin: Mmhmm, mmhmm.
Jenny: The shelves. It’s Warren the First—
Kristin: Mm.
Jenny: And Andrew.
Kristin: Mmm. Yep.
Jenny: Mmhmm!
Kristin: Yep.
Jenny: In slot number three—I guess this is—
Kristin: [simultaneously] Can we play the—can you please queue up The Righteous
Brothers for this one?
Jenny: Wow.
Kristin: Okay. Yeah, just—just imagine in your mind—just, The Righteous Brothers
are playing. Okay, go ahead, Jenny.
Jenny: In slot number three—actually, another pair of noms that features one
incorporeal—it’s Patrick Swayze in Ghost and Andrew. [both laugh] [sings] “Ohh my
love! Makin’ pottery! Oh, it’s on the wheel!”
Kristin: [simultaneously] [laughs] [singing] “I’ve hungered for your touch but you
can’t touch because I’m incorporeal! My!”
Jenny: Yes. [laughs]
Kristin: Yeah, yeah. [hums tune]
Jenny: And in slot number four, some incorporealities just like to keep it simple.
They like a man with his shirt off. Or a vampire, as the case may be. It’s Buffy the
First and Spike!
Kristin: [sighs] Never met an incorporeal, or corporeal, person who does not like to
gaze upon the chest of Spike, you know?


Jenny: Uh, amen. So, hey, you probably have feelings just like we do. If you do
and you’d like to cast a vote in our beautiful democracy, you can do so over on a
poll on our Twitter, @BufferingCast, that will go live when this episode drops and
stay live for one week. [spooky voice] Cast your vote! [normal] This is—I’m doing
this voice ‘cause—
Kristin: [simultaneously] Also, if you’re incorporeal and you cannot touch the
buttons on your screen, you can appear to us and we will tally your votes
personally.
Jenny: Or you can appear to someone else—
Kristin: And have them press the button.
Jenny: Yes. [Kristin laughs]
[SEXUAL TENSION AWARD jingle plays]
Sexual tension award!
Kristin: Well, Jenny. Another episode down.
Jenny: We did it!
Kristin: We did it. We cracked the case, we figured out who was popping up all
over Sunnydale. We still haven’t located—[sings] “Where in the world is Rupert
Giles?” [laughs]
Jenny: That’s good. That’s very good, Kristin. [laughs]
Kristin: [sings tune]
Jenny: Wow, I hope wherever he is, he’s wearing a really big, wide, red hat and a
long red trench coat. [both laugh] A look!
Kristin: Oh, god, it’s good to me. A good episode. You know, a little all over the
map, but like, we got a lot—what’s the pressure on writing your last season of
television? You know, like—
Jenny: Can’t imagine.
Kristin: It’s just gotta be so intense. So—


Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: I’ve got room for a little scattered-ness as we go. And I think we got a lot
of facts. We’ve seen the curved knives again—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: We got the girls in the Previously Ons, the Council’s gone. There’s a lot of
shit going on.
Jenny: Much was gained.
Kristin: Much. Much was gained and you know, we also got the comedic stylings of
Anya and Andrew, which I always love.
Jenny: As do I. Two of my faves.
Kristin: Mmhmm.
Jenny: Together.
Kristin: Yeah.
Jenny: You love to see it. Well. I guess that covers this episode.
Kristin: It does.
Jenny: Well. I’m Jenny Owen Youngs, and when I’m not watching Buffy and making
this podcast, I’m usually making music and sometimes playing that music live. In
fact, next week, I go on tour with my friend and yours, Hrishikesh Hirway. We’ll be
playing songs together in a collaborative set. We are taking the tour this spring to
Philly, DC, Saugerties, Brooklyn, Boston, Portland Maine, Seattle, Portland Oregon,
San Francisco, and Los Angeles! You can find tickets and info at
jennyowenyoungs.com. And while you wait for those hot, spicy tour dates to roll
around, you can pass the time by finding my songs on your favorite digital music
platform, listening to them on repeat.
Kristin: Mmm.
Jenny: Or swinging by to say hello to me on socials, @JennyOwenYoungs. Lots of
pictures of my dog can be found there.


Kristin: Ugh. Y’all, Frank took a nap for part of the recording today in my view.
[Jenny laughs] And I was just like, so honored. It was hard for me to focus on
anything else.
Jenny: Yeah, it’s—he’s very peaceful when he’s sleeping. And only when he’s
sleeping.
Kristin: [simultaneously] He’s very—also, right now, in Jenny’s office, the thing
right next to Frank’s bed is a guitalele, so it kinda looks like a guitar sized
for…[laughs] Frank.
Jenny: For Frank. Yeah, that’s Frank’s instrument, actually.
Kristin: I think he’d probably be better suited with a ukulele—
Jenny: Yeah.
Kristin: But it still is a good ratio to have next to him.
Jenny: Yeah, yeah, yeah. [laughs]
Kristin: So…my name is Kristin Russo. Though many people don’t even know my
last name, because I talk about my middle name so much. [laughs] Listen, no one
could have told me that in the year 2008, when I created my usernames across all
platforms, I would be using them for large endeavors like this. [laughs] But there
you have it. [Jenny laughs] My website is kristinnoeline. You can learn about the
work that I do with LGBTQ communities. I do talks, virtually and some in person
now, as well, for workplaces and colleges and educational institutions and all sorts
of things. So you can learn about that at kristinnoeline.com. K-R-I-S-T-I-N
N-O-E-L-I-N-E. And you can use that spelling to find me on Twitter and on
Instagram. I have been talking a lot recently about my feelings for things such as
cats, the show Euphoria, the movie Drop Dead Gorgeous. [both laugh] Among other
things. Though by March 9th, who knows what I’ll be on to?
Jenny: Sorry, I was just thinking about what you’d be on to. But I dare not make a
prediction. [Kristin laughs] Uhh, what I can tell you—
Kristin: [simultaneously] Probably right now on my socials, I’m just screaming
because I have two days left before I have to put on an entire prom—
Jenny: Ahhhhhhh!


Kristin: For, like, 500 people. That’s probably what I’m doing right now.
Jenny: Yeah. Yeah.
Kristin: I’m just screaming. [laughs]
Jenny: Well. While she screams, let me tell you, Buffering the Vampire Slayer is on
Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram @BufferingCast. And you can email us at
bufferingthevampireslayer@gmail.com.
Kristin: You can support our work on Patreon. Go to our website, that’s where you
can learn all of these things, bufferingthevampireslayer.com. You can click on
Patreon there to join our Patreon family. You can also find our store from that site
and get some fun merch. We, by now, probably have restocked the Pay Buffy
Summers sweatpants, though now who are we speaking to? The Council has
exploded. But someone should pay her! [laughs]
Jenny: Somebody, please!
Kristin: And you can just follow along. Our calendar’s there. All sorts of good
things. So, yeah.
Jenny: This episode was produced by Kristin Russo, Jenny Owen Youngs, and Alba
Daza, with support from our consultant, Mackenzie MacDade. It was edited by John
Mark Nelson. And, my friends, [Kristin laughs] corporeal and in, [Kristin laughs] till
next time…
Both: Awwoooooooooo!
