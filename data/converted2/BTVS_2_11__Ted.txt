Buffering the Vampire Slayer
Episode 2.11: Ted
Jenny: ​Hey everybody! Before we get started, just a quick reminder. I,
Jenny, am playing a few shows in the northeast next week. From April 6th
through the 9th I’ll be playing in North Hampton, Boston, Brooklyn and
Philadelphia. So, you can find tickets and information at
jennowenyoungs.com and I hope to see some of you out there in the world.
Kristin: ​Yeah and before we jump into the episode, we also wanted to let
you know our t-shirts, we are rich in t-shirts these days, we’ve got three.
Our own Buffering t-shirt, designed by Kristine Thuna, “Smash The Demon
Lizard Patriarchy,” designed by Isabella Rotman and “Just Keep Fighting,”
designed by Allison Weiss. We have all three shirts, we think, in stock.
Jenny: ​We’ve been selling through them like crazy.
Kristin: ​Like wildfire. Like nothing we have ever seen. So, thank you for
loving them. We love them too, and you can find those, if you haven’t gotten
yours already, over at bufferingthevampireslayer.com, just click on Shop.
We also have some enamel pins and it’s just a good time over there, you
know what I mean?
Jenny: ​Hell yeah!
[chime]
Jenny: ​For today’s episode, we got to talk with our friend Shannon
Woodward, an actor who’s most recently appeared in HBO’s Westworld.
Spoilers for Westworld, it’s full of robots! Spoilers for “Ted,” he’s a robot!
Shannon plays Elsa Hughes on Westworld, a character who programs robots,
so we were thrilled to get to talk to her about an earlier and more
rudimentary prototype named Ted.
[Theme song]
Jenny: ​Hello and welcome to Buffering the Vampire Slayer, a podcast in
where we are watching and discussing every episode of Buffy the Vampire
Slayer one at a time. I am Jenny Owen Youngs.


Kristin: ​And I am Kristin Russo and this week are discussing Season 2,
Episode 11, “Ted.” Stay tuned at the end of this podcast every week for an
original song written by us, recapping the Buffy episode we are discussing.
Jenny: ​“Ted” was written by David Greenwalt and Joss Whedon and directed
by Bruce Seth Green. It originally aired on December 8th 1997.
Kristin: ​So close to my 17th birthday. Buffy’s – this is the one where Buffy’s
mother brings – everybody knows what this one was, let’s be real. [Jenny
laughs]​ ​Everybody knows but I’m still gonna give you the summary. Buffy’s
mother brings home Ted. Also why don’t we name people? ​Joyce​... brings
home Ted, her new boyfriend who is… not what he seems. That’s the whole
summary. [Laughs]
Jenny: ​Uhh, accurate!
Kristin:​ Accurate, yeah.
Jenny: ​Accurate. Ted is not what he seems, Ted is a robot and we have a
very special expert guest.
Kristin: ​Mhm.
Jenny: ​A key witness in the investigation of this episode. [Kristin laughs]
Some of you, many of you, hopefully all of you will be familiar with her work
portraying Elsie Hughes on Westworld, down in Behavioural, it’s Shannon
Woodward!
Kristin: ​[Laughs]
Shannon: ​Hey guys! Hey guys!
Jenny: ​Welcome, Shannon!
Kristin: ​Hello, Shannon!
Shannon: ​I heard you guys needed a little help with a problematic robot, is
that right?


Jenny: ​Yeah, we went to Narrative and they were useless.
Shannon: ​They’re completely useless.​ ​[Kristin laughs] No. I, well Jenny and
I were talking a couple of months ago and she knows I’m a big Buffy fan.
God, when you said, by the way, what year this was in. 1997! This is crazy.
I was thirteen years old.
Jenny: ​Hell yeah.
Kristin: ​Wow!
Shannon: ​I know this, like, I know this episode so well and I don’t want to
offend anyone but it is maybe my – one of my least favorite episodes of this
show.
Jenny: ​Fair.
Shannon: ​But I always called it the Westworld episode.
Jenny: ​That’s –
Shannon: ​Because I knew the movie, not because I was like [high pitched
voice] “One day I’m gonna be on a TV show!” [laughter]
Kristin: ​But how amazingly cool is that!? That, like, you were thirteen and
you were like, this is the Westworld episode and now you’re on a podcast
about that episode because you’re on Westworld.
Shannon: ​I know, it’s all really come full circle. I mean if, you know, talking
about Ted was my ultimate life dream, things are really looking up for me
this evening.
Kristin: ​[Laughing] When we talked to Shannon, we were like, “So yeah, we
would love to have you on an episode, you know, for Season 2 if you want”
and she was like, “well, I like this episode and this episode but I have a
feeling you’re gonna want me…” [Laughs]


Shannon: ​Yeah, I was like, I think maybe it would be most appropriate for
me to talk about the Westworld episode.
Kristin: ​Yeah.
Shannon: ​I mean, and listen, John Ritter is amazing –
Kristin: ​He really is.
Shannon: ​And he is the only replacement for Yul Brynner I will tolerate.
[laughter]
Kristin: ​[Laughs]​ ​Ooooh​ ​yeah, we have a lot to discuss, there’s a lot.
Shannon: ​Yeah, where do we even start?
Jenny: ​I mean, we could start with Xander’s pants.
Kristin: ​We should!
Jenny: ​They are sails!
Shannon: ​They got JNCOs!
Kristin: ​Yes! Right! Totally, did you wear pants like this?
Shannon: ​Absolutely not! [Laughs]
Jenny: ​[Laughs]
Kristin: ​[laughs] I ask cause I know that two –
Jenny: ​You’re in a room with two people –
Shannon: ​Did you guys both wear those pants?
Kristin: ​Ohh, yeah!
Jenny: ​Of course. I wanted to fit in.


Kristin: ​Mine look better than Xander’s.
Shannon: ​I wasn’t that much of a tomboy as a kid so like, I actually, every
week, especially like, Season 3, which – don’t worry, I won’t spoil anything,
I’m just talking about clothes here.
Kristin: ​You’re like, “they wear pants” and we’re like, “Shannon, we told
you, no spoilers!”
Shannon: ​There’s hoodies, no hoodies, don’t say it! No, I remember I would
go to like Marvin’s, is it Marvin’s? Mervin’s? Mervin’s.
Kristin: ​MER-vin’s.
Shannon: ​Mervin’s.
Kristin: ​That’s a California thing. Were you here –
Jenny: ​What the hell is Mervin’s?
Shannon: ​No, they had one in Texas, I was in Austin at the time, but I
remember I would like go to try to find like the outfits that Buffy would
wear.
Jenny: ​[Whispering] Yes.
Shannon: ​And I would try to like dress like her. My friends would always
clock it, they’d be like, “cool overalls, yeah we saw that.” [laughter] I mean,
and in hindsight, I see pictures and I remember the outfits I was trying to
copy and they weren’t flattering. Like, I didn‘t look ​anything ​like Buffy.
Kristin: ​I mean some of them aren’t even flattering on… you know what I
mean? They’re not…
Shannon: ​Yeah.
Jenny: ​What percentage of clothing was flattering in the 1990s?


Kristin: ​Very little, except, I mean, listen...
Shannon: ​I don’t know, Buffy looks pretty cute to me.
Kristin: ​This episode, Buffy had a lot of serious costumes in this episode.
Shannon: ​Yeah, things were really intense.
Kristin: ​Like, she’s wearing heels to mini golf.
Shannon: ​Kitten heels, even!
Kristin: ​Yeah, she’s got, like – the thing that she wears right after the mini
golf outfit, where she’s in the red patterned thing.
Jenny: ​The thing that’s like made out of upholstery like fabric.
Shannon: ​The camisole. It was like a camisole and then like an over thing, I
was like, oh wow, double pattern! I mean, it’s pretty cool…
Kristin: ​Yeah, it’s great, but like she’s literally just in her house and her
kitchen.
Jenny: ​It’s made out of drapes.
Kristin: ​Okay.
Shannon: ​They were all like very expensive. These were a lot of expensive
outfits. I was really… that jacket she’s wearing when she’s sitting on the
stoop when the coroner is dragging the ​robot ​out, by the way, because
apparently no one noticed that he has steel for limbs. [laughter] But that
jacket, I was like, that’s got to be a $4000 coat, that’s an expensive coat.
Kristin: ​[Laughs] Yeah, they really went for it. And we don’t even have Kate
with us this week to talk about it, but I think Kate would have had a lot to
say for this episode.
Shannon: ​There’s a lot to be said.


Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​There’s a lot of costumes. My big note before the credits about
costumes, besides Xander’s pants was Willow’s condom hat, as I called it.
Jenny: ​[Laughs]
Shannon: ​Is it a Kangol hat? Do you remember those? Those Kangol bucket
hats? And they were like – I feel like that’s what it was.
Kristin: ​Yeah, it’s rolled up, just like very tightly around her head, just –
Shannon: ​Do you think she thought it was funny? I wonder if she was like,
“this is funny hat, I’ve got to wear it, it’s so silly!”
Kristin: ​I don’t know, when I look back at the hats I wore in the 90s, now I
would think I would’ve known that they were ridiculous, but I sure didn’t!
Shannon: ​Right.
Jenny: ​There was a lot of collective bad hat decision-making and
permission-granting.
Kristin: ​My only fan picture of my whole life is with Letters to Cleo and I’m
wearing a fisherman bucket hat.
Shannon: ​Oh no!
Jenny: ​Yeah...
Kristin: ​Yeah, it’s really something.
Jenny: ​It’s great.
Shannon: ​I remember that time in the 90s where suddenly it was like, “you
know who was so cool? Gilligan! [laughter] Why don’t we dress more like
him?” And everybody was like, collectively: “absolutely, absolutely.”
Jenny: ​[Laughs] Yeah, yeah!


Shannon: ​And then they were like “But, you know what’s missing? I love
the hat, you’re dead on about that trend. What if it was fuzzy?” And
everyone again was like, “Yes! Yes!”
Jenny: ​[Laughing] “Why didn’t we think of this already?” Spectacular.
Kristin: ​[Laughing, groans] Yeah, we’re so happy! Oh god. So –
Shannon: ​Anyway…
Kristin: ​Anyhow, fantastic outfits, we get to the house, the door is open, a
glass breaks. Buffy goes to Joyce’s rescue and what does she find, but her
mother making out with –
Shannon: ​Pre-boning.
Kristin: ​Yeah – [Laughs]
Jenny: ​Gross! An objection. First, I have an objection to “pre-boning” and
secondary –
Shannon: ​[makes gagging noise] You’re fired! I never said – I just made it
up. [laughter] But it felt gross enough to say that like, that’s Buffy’s
reaction, so I feel like I got it out of everyone one of us. Like, oh god, no!
Kristin: ​Yeah, she is not pleased.
Jenny: ​Secondary objection, the amount of time that passes between the
breaking glass, the scream of “no!” and then just exactly how wrapped
together they are, I –
Kristin: ​Well, Ted is a big man. [Laughs]
Jenny: ​[Groaning with displeasure]
Shannon: ​Also, it must have fallen in such a particular direction that they
were like, “absolutely no risk of getting cut!”


Jenny: ​Yeah, yeah. [Laughs] We’ll just leave that there and move closer.
Shannon: ​Let’s keep pre-boning!
Kristin: ​Yeah – oh god, oh god.
Shannon: ​I’m gonna keep saying it, it’s so bad. It’s so bad.
Jenny: ​[groans unhappily and laughs]
Kristin: ​It’s so bad. And this is the shortest pre-credits situation I think
we’ve seen to date.
Jenny: ​It’s so quick.
Kristin: ​It takes one second, this happens…
Shannon: ​Because he’s probably the most famous guest star they’d had ‘till
then, it was a great reveal for them.
Jenny: ​Ahhhh!
Kristin: ​Yeah, that’s true.
Shannon: ​They were like, “And we’ve got John Ritter!”
Kristin: ​Yeah! He’s their first special guest, special guest star.
Shannon: ​Yeah, and I’m trying to think, were there other – I don’t know if I
can think of anyone who was bigger than John Ritter who was ever a guest
on the show.
Kristin: ​Yeah, I don’t know –
Shannon: ​No offense to all the other guest stars on the show but John
Ritter’s a legend, so.
Kristin: ​Yeah, John Ritter was –


Jenny: ​Yeah, he’s pretty massive. Oh well, there’s Joel Grey, appears later.
Amy Adams before Amy Adams is anyone.
Kristin: ​Really?
Shannon: ​What episode is she in?
Jenny: ​Um...
Shannon: ​Do you have to tell me after? We’ll spoil it.
Jenny: ​I think it’s season four or five, I’ll tell you later what the context is.
Shannon: ​Okay, yeah, tell me later. That’s so funny. I never knew that.
Kristin: ​Yeah, I didn’t either, but I also... so I’m in the room now with two
Buffy-philes.
Jenny: ​Oh! Also, the guy from… Prison Break! Is –
Kristin: ​Wentworth?
Shannon: ​Wentworth. There’s a lot of people that are… I just mean he was
already famous.
Jenny: ​Oh right! But John Ritter is a legend.
Kristin: ​Yeah.
Jenny: ​Right, I got too excited.
Shannon: ​He was already, anyway yeah, so that’s why the cold open was
so quick.
Kristin: ​Totally. That makes so much sense.
Shannon: ​Why upstage him with more story?
Kristin: ​Right.


Jenny: ​Right. Right.
Kristin: ​Get that credit in and have her be like, “Oh my god, that was John
Ritter!”
Shannon: ​And we finally have Buffy really acting like a full-on teenager for
really probably the first time.
Kristin: ​Yes!
Jenny: ​Totally.
Shannon: ​Which is such a role reversal for them because usually Joyce is
the one who needs Buffy’s help. And Buffy is in an adult position and it’s
unfair and it’s a lot of weight on her shoulders. And it kind of makes the
whole metaphor of the show really work, and then all of a sudden this one
they’re like “…and we’re gonna make Buffy a child for the first time.”
Kristin: ​Yeah.
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Shannon: ​The stakes are the most realistic, I feel like, in this episode than
they are in the rest of the series. At least as much as I can remember, and I
think that’s why I always didn’t like the episode as much, because it’s like
reality comes crashing in on you.
Kristin: ​Yeah.
Jenny: ​Right right.
Kristin: ​Yeah, I mean it’s the first time that we’re seeing Buffy grapple with
the fact that this isn’t a demon. I mean, we eventually find out that he’s
made of steel.
Shannon: ​She gets interrogated by the police like –
Kristin: ​Yeah!


Shannon: ​There’s a full-on interrogation scene, it went SVU for a minute.
Kristin: ​And we talk a lot on this podcast about the lack of police
intervention. [laughs]
Shannon: ​Right. They really get involved this time, they went to the school,
they were like, “We want to see your teacher’s notebooks on Buffy.” And
he’s like, “Thanks for this” and one of the teachers is like “looky here” and
he’s like “Uh uh uh, that looks like murder time to me!”
Kristin: ​[Laughs] Giles just hands over the Vampyre book, like, a leather
bound – he’s like “this is all I have on Buffy, good luck.”
Jenny: ​[Laughs]
Shannon: ​He does say something in the hallway to her at one point where
he’s like, “I told them…” and then he kinda gets cut off, and you’re like,
“What did you tell them?”
Jenny: ​Yeah, what exactly…
Kristin: ​Yeah, what did you tell – “She’s moody.​ ​She was really taking it out
on that vampire.”
Shannon: ​She’s in the library a ​lot​. [laughter] Loves to read.
Jenny: ​Book-cracker Buffy, that’s her nickname.
Shannon: ​Yeah, that’s her nickname.
Kristin: ​And plus, I feel like this episode – I feel – I don’t know how you feel
but I feel like we have even more wiggle room to kind of, like, talk about
bigger –
Shannon: ​Right, because it’s an interstitial episode.
Jenny: ​Noone’s like, “ugh, the narrative...”


Kristin: ​“I can’t believe they didn’t mention – ” yeah.
Shannon: ​Wait, can I just say that they really did touch on something that
matters to me a lot? In the scene right after the cold open, when Xander
and Willow are over at the house and they’re in the kitchen. And Ted is
making pizza ​perfectly​. They have a pizza robot. [laughter]​ ​Someone made
a ​pizza robot​. And honestly, I’ve never heard of a better idea.
Kristin: ​[Laughs] It’s true, but I have to ask you, because one of my notes
was also about the pizza…
Shannon: ​Yeah?
Kristin: ​[laughing] ‘Cause I looked at that pizza, Shannon.
Shannon: ​It didn’t look good.
Kristin: ​No, it didn’t. It didn’t. It didn’t. [Laughs]
Shannon​: And bless the prop people, but they made those in the staff
kitchen, six or seven hours before. Because the day ran long, you know,
they were supposed to make the – they didn’t have time to pre-melt the
cheese.
Jenny: ​I feel like my mom used to get those at Costco? They just like –
Kristin: ​The hockey puck pizzas.
Jenny: ​Yeah, exactly.
Shannon: ​You think they were actually just the Costco ones?
Jenny: ​I think they were just straight up –
Shannon: ​Yeah, they were just cooked.
Jenny: ​Is that less realistic than...
Shannon: ​No, I think that’s more realistic. But they cook them in like –


Kristin:​ [Laughs] But I liked your story more.
Shannon: ​But they still did make them in the crap oven there on the stage
or whatever.
Kristin: ​Right.​ ​I just love that everyone was like, “These are the best
pizzas” and they were like clanging off of the dishes. [laughs]
Shannon: ​I feel like they had so much to get to that day that the director’s
note of like, “Can we make the pizzas looks, I dunno, edible?” and they were
like, “Nah, forget it.”
Jenny: ​[Laughs]
Kristin: ​[Laughs] Yeah, not today.
Jenny: ​He made it sound really good when he was talking about baking
them and then sautéing them in olive oil and herbs, so I thought…
Kristin: ​Yeah! You have to use a cast iron.
Jenny: ​No room for compromise.
Shannon: ​He’s like, “And you gotta use the cast iron!”
Kristin: ​Right.
Jenny: ​Later, someone will use the cast iron.
Kristin: ​I don’t want to miss – there’s a few quotes in this episode that I
don’t want to miss. And one of them I think happens right before we get to
the pizzas, which is when Buffy makes this off-hand comment to Joyce about
how she must have been cataloguing more than art.
Shannon: ​[Laughs] Yeah!
Jenny: ​Sick. Gross.


Shannon: ​But she says it in this way where she’s, like, really hurt. She’s
like, [dejected] “Guessing you’ve been... cataloguing more than art.” And
you’re like, “are you worried your mom’s cheating on you?” It’s so funny.
But she says it in this really earnestly hurt way that really made me laugh.
Kristin: ​[Laughs] Yeah. Joyce is all – I mean, I give everybody a pass on
this because we find out that they’re, of course, eating drugged – delicious,
but drugged food. But Joyce – [crosstalk]
Shannon: ​It’s pot food, right?
Kristin: ​Yeah, they’re just eating edibles for the whole episode.
Shannon: ​They’re like, “I love this stuff, it’s delicious!” [laughter]
Kristin: ​But it’s just like, Joyce – I know it’s the drugs, whatever. But Joyce
is – come on, Joyce is not Joyce in this episode. I cannot believe that Joyce
is gonna fall for Ted. I just can’t!
Jenny: ​She’s a mess.
Shannon: ​I know. It’s one of those things where, and a lot of shows do this,
they’re just like, “Well, for this episode, you’re just this person. Let’s just
like...” And Buffy’s mom has always been that character to me in the show
that like, she’s there to serve a purpose for the story, you know, as a barrier
between Buffy being a grownup or not, you know?
Kristin: ​Mmm. Right.
Shannon: ​And this way, it really keeps her a child. And also, the fact that
Joyce is suddenly like, “I don’t believe anything you ever say, Buffy.”
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​Right!?
Shannon: ​When she’s like, “He said he would slap my little face” and she’s
like, “He said no such thing.” I was like, “Ahh, I feel really triggered by
this...” [Laughs]


Jenny: ​Yeah. [Laughs]
Kristin: ​Yeah...
Shannon: ​It’s like someone being like, “That person raped me” and they’re
like, [laughing] “No they didn’t, you stupid woman, shut your whore mouth!”
Kristin: ​Right!
Jenny: ​[Laughs] Fuck.
Kristin: ​But that’s kinda of where we’re at with this episode, it really truly
is. It’s so violent.
Shannon: ​I know, yeah.
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Shannon: ​Yeah, it’s very purposeful too. It’s definitely – it’s not lost on
them. I mean, it’s smart, it’s just dark.
Kristin: ​It is!
Shannon: ​It’s one of the darkest episodes because it really does hit home in
a way that the rest of the show doesn’t. It’s more of a metaphor where this
becomes really real. Her mother has a horrible, misogynist, abusive
boyfriend. And Buffy tries to save her mom and the cops are like, “we’re
gonna lock you up forever!” It’s dark! [laughs]
Kristin: ​Yes! We’re really jumping around but like the scene with the cops is
– you know, they’re really questioning the victim in the situation, although
Ted is dead at this point. But there’s just a lot – you know what there’s a lot
of, guys?
Jenny: ​Is it ​the patriarchy?
Kristin: ​It’s the patriarchy!


Shannon: ​It’s a lot – I mean, they should have just called this episode
“Patriarchy.”
Kristin: ​Yes. [Laughs]
Jenny: ​[Laughs]
Kristin: ​Because, I have a whole patriarchy segment of my notes.
Jenny: ​Wow.
Kristin: ​But I mean, they’re mostly just quotes from Ted. Ted makes me
more uncomfortable than I think any character we have seen to date. And
there are demons that – I don’t like looking at the Master’s fruit punch
mouth. I don’t like it.
Shannon: ​It’s ‘cause this one really hits home. It’s a little too close to
home.
Kristin: ​It is his like, you know, “Joyce, let ​me​ handle this” and of course,
“​little lady.” “Sweetheart.”​ [Jenny makes an uncomfortable noise] There’s
just so much of that fucking bullshit.
Shannon: ​“I beg to differ, little lady...”
Kristin: ​Ugh.
Jenny:​ ​[whimpers] No.
Kristin: ​It really – it makes my body feel bad. My whole – my nerves – my
nerve endings are just not… yeah, there’s a lot.
Jenny: ​Ugh.
Kristin: ​So, yeah, this episode, you’re right, this episode could be titled
“The Patriarchy.”
Shannon:​ Heavy stuff.


Kristin:​ We’ve had a couple of episodes that, you know – “Reptile Boy” was
super – you know, it had a demon lizard chained the basement that they
would sacrifices girl to. [Laughing] So there was patriarchy there. [laughter]
But this one is, yeah, you’re right. I mean, overall, it’s just very real. It’s like
real people, even though he’s a robot. He ​was ​a real person and he’s the
embodiment of his real person –
Shannon: ​Is that... true?
Kristin: ​Right? Did I read the story wrong?
Shannon: ​I don’t think they said anything like that, right?
Jenny: ​I think at the very end, there’s a little bit of exposition where they’re
trying to explain it really quick…
Kristin: ​And what did they say?
Jenny: ​Xander’s talking and they said Ted, the real, the original Ted…
Kristin: ​Ted 1.0.
Jenny: ​Uh, was a brilliant computer programmer –
Shannon: ​Oh right, and made a robot himself.
Jenny: ​Got sick, his wife left him. He made a robot of himself who then
went and got the wife, I guess?
Kristin: ​And then killed the wife.
Jenny: ​And maybe killed her or held her captive until she died and then got
another wife, and another wife, and another wife…
Shannon: ​So where’s real Ted?
Jenny: ​Dead.
Kristin: ​Dead. I guess?


Shannon: ​Okay.
Jenny: ​Of cancer, or something close to cancer is kind of what they implied,
but back in the 50s or something.
Kristin: ​It’s a very loose – it’s a very loosely…
Jenny: ​They really don’t go to any trouble to outline it.
Shannon: ​I mean, the craziest thing too is that of all the stuff that they’ve
seen, of all the supernatural stuff, this is a practical thing. Like, someone
has jumped a thousand years or something technologically and been like,
no, this guy who works at a remedial software company whose a software
salesman, by the way. It just turns out, like, he built an incredible android!
And everybody's like, huh!
Kristin: ​[Laughing] Sure, yeah! Of course!
Shannon: ​So I’m not gonna tell Mom that. I mean, she might be onto my
vampire stuff if I tell her about that really intense computer she was dating.
[laughter] Like, it’s just so weird, it’s such a strange jump.
Kristin: ​So okay, chronologically, Buffy is like “I hate Ted” and then goes to
the graveyard, cemetery, I can never remember which the fuck it is.
Jenny: ​Cemetery, let’s say.
Kristin: ​Cemetery and beats the shit out of a vampire, taking her
aggressions out. And the only reason that I want to call attention to it is
because Giles says, “It’s staking time.” And I love it. And Shannon, we
watch the episodes twice, so we watched this yesterday before we watched
it today. And last night when we watched it and Giles said that, I sang
“Closing Time” but using “staking time.” So I just wanted everyone to know
that.
Shannon: ​Great!
Kristin: ​And that’s my complete story about that scene.


Jenny: ​That’s something you can do at home, too.
Kristin: ​What do you mean? Oh, you can, yes.
Jenny: ​The listener.
Kristin: ​Yes, you too, listeners, you too can sing [singing] ​Staking time…
Jenny: ​Great!
Kristin: ​You’re welcome. Thank you. [Laughs]
Shannon: ​Also after that scene, you know, I pointed this out when we were
watching it. Buffy’s never winded unless it’s a plot point.
Kristin: ​[laughs]
Jenny: ​[laughs] Well, is that ‘cause she’s the slayer and she’s super strong?
Shannon: ​It’s because the actress didn’t, like, have to –
Jenny:​ Didn’t feel like it?
Shannon:​ Her stunt double, who’s amazing by the way. I remember being
such a big fan when I was watching the show live as a kid, of her stunt
double because she’s incredible. But it’s like, she just steps in and just the
last bit, and then she does her scene. But every time I’m like, god, that
stunt double was exhausted, she was breathing so hard. [Jenny and Kristin
laugh] And she’s like [pants loudly] and doing roundhouses and all of a
sudden she’s like, “Oh Giles, I’m so bored” and it just makes me laugh.
Kristin: ​[laughing] You know, last week we learned that that stunt double
was also the stunt double for the pink ranger, right?
Jenny:​ Yeah!
Shannon: ​I knew that!


Kristin: ​Yeah!
Shannon: ​But I wonder what she went on to do, that’s the thing. I never
looked her up after. I wonder what she does now.
Kristin: ​I dunno!
Jenny: ​We should find out.
Kristin: ​We should and we can find out.
Shannon: ​[chanting] Let’s find out. Let’s find out.
Jenny: ​Y’all. Here we go. Buffy’s stunt double was, of course, Sophia
Crawford.
Shannon: ​Yuh! Big ups!
Jenny: ​Who was one of triplets.
Shannon: ​What!?
Kristin: ​What!?
Jenny: ​That’s right. She also performed as Sarah Michelle Gellar’s stunt
double in Scream 2.
Kristin: ​What!? Be still my...
Shannon: ​Because when you’ve got a great double, that’s a thing, by the
way, that people do. They get the part and –
Jenny: ​Some people look their whole life for a great double and never find
one.
Kristin: ​I love when Wes Craven gets brought up on this podcast. My
favorite thing. Something that is really small that I just need to say because
I noticed it last episode, is the fucking vending machine in the school.
There’s a whole second row of snacks where they’re all upside down.


Shannon: ​I saw that. I think it’s because they’re trying to hide the logos.
Kristin: ​Except for, they’re Fritos and Doritos. You know what I mean? They
are.
Jenny: ​Like you don’t recognize that upside down?
Shannon: ​They are, but they can’t show the logos, I think.
Kristin: ​It’s so funny, it’s just so funny. Like, you’d think they’d go for
non-branded snacks.
Shannon: ​I bet it was actually just easier to just get real ones and just hide
the names.
Kristin: ​So funny.
Jenny: ​Mmmmm.
Kristin: ​And like, did the cast and crew ever eat the snacks out of the
vending machine or was it just for show?
Shannon: ​I wonder if it’s actually just the vending machine in the school.
Jenny: ​Oh yeah.
Kristin: ​Oh, in Torrance High School?
Shannon: ​I bet it probably is and that’s why they’re upside down, they just
open it up and turn them upside down.
Kristin: ​I love it. So Xander has a pretty good episode.
Shannon: ​He’s very funny in this episode.
Kristin: ​He’s very –
Jenny: ​He’s funny and inoffensive.


Kristin: ​Yes! And we – Shannon, we talk about Xander a good amount
because our listeners talk about Xander a good amount and because we talk
about the patriarchy a good amount. And somebody – a few people have
written in to us saying, you know, Xander – the character Xander is really
tasked with kind of the burden of carrying the patriarchy because he is really
the teenage boy and what have you. But a few people have written in to us
and said, but in future episodes, where characters start to be introduced
who can carry that weight, Xander starts to be, you know, a more fully
fleshed out character and what have you. And I feel like this is the first real
example of it that we’re seeing, ‘cause Ted is – Ted’s doing a fine job.
Jenny: ​Ted’s handling it.
Shannon: ​I think there’s another reason for it too though, which is, for the
first season and a half, Xander’s pouty because he doesn’t get Buffy. And
that’s the patriarchy there, right? That he feels like he deserves her, and it’s
that way he feels open about pouting about it and annoyed that he can’t
have her that’s so patriarchal. And then he starts getting some from Cordelia
and suddenly he’s like, okay, I’ve got mine so we’re good now.
Jenny: ​“I’m in a better mood now.”
Kristin: ​You’re right!
Shannon:​ And so that’s why he gets to change his attitude, because his
drive is now elsewhere.
Kristin: ​Wow.
Jenny: ​Great assessment.
Kristin: ​So the patriarchy lives.
Shannon: ​The patriarchy lives. It’s just that he’s distracted and he has his
other outlet, one that is a character. We don’t mind if he gives her a hard
time because –
Jenny:​ [laughing] ‘Cause she can hold her own?


Shannon:​ She’s a ridiculous character, in a great way.
Kristin: ​Yeah, actually – a ridiculous character in a great way. I didn’t think
she was gonna get her jingle...
Jenny: ​But now’s the time.
Kristin: ​But now, you know what, she’s going to get her jingle.
[Cordelia Jingle plays]
Cordelia (ah-ahh)
I love you, Cordelia (ah-ahh)
You’re perfect, Cordelia
Kristin: ​Well. Now you’ve heard the jingle, Shannon, what do you think?
Shannon: ​Uh you know, it’s interesting you say she’s perfect. She knows
that already. [laughter] It’s a lot more moving than I expected it to be, it
was sweet. It was really sweet. It was ethereal, which is not what I think
when I think of Cordelia. But I’m really into it.
Jenny: ​I think in the off hours, at the end of a long hard day of being
Cordelia, I think what Cordelia really needs is a gentle, ethereal appreciation
jingle.
Shannon: ​Yeah and like a melatonin. [laughter]
Kristin: ​Definitely a melatonin.
Shannon:​ Give ‘er some mela-tee!
Kristin:​ Someone who does not have a jingle but who is really holding
strong in this season, appears. Jenny Calendar.
Shannon: ​Jenny Calendar.
Kristin: ​What are your Jenny Calendar feelings?


Shannon: ​Honestly?
Kristin: ​Yeah.
Shannon: ​I was never a huge Jenny Calendar fan. And rewatching now,
‘cause obviously I haven't watched the show in a long time. She just really
seems, like, really crazy to me. She’s got crazy eyes in a way that I feel like
Giles would spot. But you know, it’s a cute little bit. Always out of left field
for me, sorry to all the Jenny Calendar fans.
Jenny:​ [laughs] They are legion.
Kristin:​ No, I mean, everybody’s got their –
Shannon:​ I just don’t respond to her the way I feel like I’m supposed to.
Kristin: ​Yeah. The last few episodes for her, she’s been going through some
stuff.
Jenny: ​Yeah, yeah. She got possessed by a demon.
Shannon:​ It seems like a real warning sign that’s she’s like, “Listen, you are
making me feel bad.” I get it –
Kristin:​ Yeah, I didn’t like this scene.
Shannon:​ But it’s real snappy. I was like, oh, she’s a little intense.
Kristin:​ Jenny was into it.
Jenny:​ I really like that she’s so good at saying what she needs when Giles
is, in fact, lingering about, after essentially being responsible for something
super traumatic that happened to her.
Kristin: ​Yeah, that’s true.
Shannon:​ Yeah.
Kristin: ​I was gonna say, Giles is pulling a Jenny Owen Youngs –


Jenny: ​How dare you.
Kristin:​ In this scene.
Shannon:​ It’s not so much what she’s saying. It’s how she’s saying it.
Jenny:​ It’s not a great vibe.
Shannon:​ I’m feeling warning signs. [laughter] But you know, she’s just,
like, a casual witch.
Kristin:​ A techno-pagan, you know.
Shannon:​ Yeah, just a techno-pagan computer teacher.
Jenny:​ Just casting some bones on the internet.
Kristin: ​So we’re in this episode but you’re here. And can we just hear a
little bit about your relationship to this show, ‘cause we know it, but they
don’t – the listeners don’t know.
Shannon:​ To Buffy?
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Shannon:​ I mean, I was just an über fan. I was such an über fan. I would
watch every episode live and I would record the show on my VCR. I had
every episode. I would just buy VHS tapes from Eckerds. When my mom
would go I would be like, “I have to go because I need to get another VHS
tape.”
Jenny:​ Yes!
Shannon: ​And I would record it on extended play. Did you know you can do
that? You could set your VCR to record at a much slower rate so you could
get eight hours out of something instead of getting, like, two hours.


Jenny:​ What?
Kristin: ​Wow! Wait, so it recorded at a lower quality?
Shannon:​ Yeah, at a lower quality so you could get more because it’s not
like I was made of money when I was thirteen.
Kristin:​ Right.
Shannon: ​You know, my parents weren’t exactly dying to encourage – I
knew how to set the VCR timer. And as soon as IRC was around, then I was
downloading the episodes ‘cause that was legal at the time. Nobody was
streaming anything. You’d get like MPEGs. I was encoding MPEGs.
Kristin:​ Oh my goodness.
Jenny:​ Wow.
Shannon:​ Just really, truly the nerdiest person.
Kristin:​ Do you have a favorite character? Even if they haven’t appeared
yet.
Shannon: ​Yeah, I was just a Buffy person. It was a great role model. She
was smart, she was funny, she was never too put upon because of the
burden that she had. You know, she was... I don’t know, I think I just
wanted to relate to her. Saying I related to her sounds like I’m
complimenting myself.
Kristin: ​I don’t know, I say it all the time so you go right ahead.
Shannon:​ Even when we were shooting Westworld, I was telling our
showrunner, Lisa Joy, after we finished the season, we were talking about it
and we were talking about Buffy. ‘Cause she is a big Buffy fan too. And I
was like, “I feel like I play Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but you know, slightly
nerdier” and she’s like “Okay, or you’re more Willow” and I was like “No, I
see myself as this” and she was like “Okay, I don’t want to mess that up for
you. But, you know.” [Kristin laughs] And I’m like, [stuttering] “No, I’m –
I’m Buffy.” “Whatever you want to think, Shannon. That’s just not how I –”


[laughter]
Kristin: ​Amazing.
Shannon:​ Not that I’m not a Willow fan, I am. I was just like, I just never
really connected with Willow.
Kristin:​ Right, you see yourself as a Buffy. Hell yes.
Shannon:​ Yeah. Anyway, so funny. I remember actually when I was – I
came to L.A. to start acting when I was about 15. So the show was still on, it
was still shooting. I mean, they were probably doing Season 4 or 5.
Kristin:​ Mm-hmm.
Shannon:​ And I went to their stage for an audition because their casting
directors were casting something else. And I went to the stage and they
gave me a visitor sticker and I was slow walking through their set. Like,
through the graveyard.
Kristin: ​Oh my god.
Shannon: ​I was just like “Oh my god!” I was freaking out. I don’t even
remember what I was auditioning for, I know I didn’t get the job. I was just,
like, so excited – I was a child. I was so excited. I remember I went up to an
AD and was like, “Do you think maybe Sarah Michelle Gellar would let me
meet her?” and they were like, “No! Get off our lot” [laughter]
Kristin: ​Oh no!
Shannon: ​Right, this was after my audition, but I remember I found this the
other day in some old notebook, the visitor sticker.
Jenny:​ Oh my god.
Shannon: ​And I wrote on the side of the sticker “the day I almost met the
cast of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”
Jenny:​ Oh my god!


Kristin: ​That’s so wonderful!
Shannon:​ It’s so embarrassing even to say out loud. Just like, such a nerd.
It was still so real to me.
Kristin:​ Yeah, I mean, it was still going on.
Shannon: ​I’m actually really glad I didn’t see – but I was just like, “oh my
god, this is crazy!” When I first came to L.A., I drove to Torrance High
School and walked around.
Jenny: ​Hell yeah!
Kristin:​ Of course you did. Did those VHS tapes – are they long gone?
Shannon: ​Yeah, I think I threw them out or gave them to Goodwill or
something. Probably around 18 or 19.
Kristin: ​Yeah.
Shannon: ​I mean, as soon as I started working and I was busy, the fixation
was removed. I think ‘cause –
Kristin: ​Yeah.
Shannon: ​But I mean, it was, like, truly a fixation.
Kristin:​ Goodness, goodness. Well, and jumping back into the episode now,
you’re an Angel fan.
Shannon:​ Yeah, I was an Angel fan.
Kristin: ​We get a little Angel here.
Shannon:​ Yeah.
Kristin: ​My note is “Angel’s sexy hand wrap.” That’s how I wanted to
remember this scene.


Shannon: ​[laughs] It’s also something that you can so easily do yourself.
[laughter] The hand wrap? It’s such a simple wound to be like, “Ah, it’s time
to redress it.” Also, like, what, ‘cause he’s gonna get an infection?
Jenny:​ Also don’t vampires heal fast?
Kristin: ​Yeah, he heals –
Shannon:​ That’s what I mean.
Jenny: ​What the fuck!
Shannon:​ Also he’s definitely not gonna get an infection. It’s not like he’s
like, “well, I don’t wanna lose the hand, I’ve had it for 300 years.” [laughter]
“Because I take good care of my wounds.”
Kristin: ​I don’t know, maybe it’s their foreplay. You know? A little hand
wrapping, a little making out.
Jenny: ​A little pre-boning.
Kristin:​ Oh, come on! You guys are really holding onto –
Shannon:​ Pre-B! [laughter]
Kristin:​ No! No, no!
Jenny:​ I apologize.
Shannon: ​Never be sorry.
Kristin: ​But yeah, we get a little bit of Angel.
Shannon:​ A little bit. A little bit of hard making out. The making out is
getting –
Kristin:​ Yeah, they’re going somewhere, those two.


Shannon:​ They’re at a 7 on a 1-10 right now.
Kristin:​ So this is where your expertise, Shannon, is gonna start to come
into play.
Shannon:​ Yeah!
Kristin: ​Because we’re at mini-golf and Ted fucking loses his fucking mind.
Shannon:​ Yeah!
Kristin:​ He shorts. I think he loses – I don’t know. You would probably –
from your research for your character –
Shannon:​ My research for my character – [laughter] [nerdy voice] robots
tend to get very upset when they lose mini-golf. [laughter] I don’t know if
you’ve met a lot of androids, but I know Maeve really loses it. [normal voice]
Yeah, I think this actually should be a niche exhibit at Westworld. Just the
narrative where the robot is really serious about mini-golf. [Jenny laughs]
Just Teddy is like [in a low Southern accent] “Well sir, the rules are the
rules. I saw you kick that ball out of the rough.” You can see, my robot
accent is –
Kristin: ​Wow, that was a pretty great Teddy, just for the record.
Shannon:​ Thank you so much. It would be too weird if I actually tried to
impersonate a co-worker. I feel like that’s – it’s crossing the line. [laughter]
Kristin: ​So yeah, this is – oh sorry, Jenny, go ahead.
Jenny:​ I just feel like Buffy is super strong and she has all these heightened
senses and abilities. Why wouldn’t she just hit it out of the rough? I feel like
she could’ve gotten a hole-in-two.
Kristin:​ Well, because I think like what Shannon mentioned earlier, she’s
really being portrayed as the teenager –


Shannon:​ It’s like what we were saying before, where Joyce kinda serves a
different purpose. It happens a lot I think on this show – this episode in
particular is like, well, Buffy’s a teenager this time.
Jenny:​ Right right right.
Shannon:​ This is about the real weight of –
Kristin: ​They’re like, put her in the kitten heels, make her clomp over to the
rough, walk over to the thing. But this is great, John Ritter is fucking
incredible.
Jenny: ​Yeah, what a great creep.
Kristin: ​He’s terrifying.
Shannon: ​He is terrifying.
Kristin:​ Yeah, he’s an incredible creep. He really embodies this, freaks
everybody out. And then as we’ve already discussed, Joyce doesn’t believe
Buffy.
Jenny:​ Ugh!
Shannon:​ Remember when Ted tells Buffy that it’s okay to have feelings?
Kristin:​ Ohhh!
Shannon:​ I kind of lost my shit emotionally watching that again. I was like,
“I feel so triggered [gets faster and faster and angrier] I can have feelings if
I want to! Of course I can, I’m a human!” [laughter]
Kristin:​ We’ll be offering that noise from –
Shannon:​ Thank you for telling me that it’s okay for my heart to beat!
Kristin:​ That noise from Shannon will be offered as a ringtone. It’ll be called
the patriarchy ringtone. [laughter]


Shannon:​ If you could text me that ringtone, I will... actually, just before I
forget, I was thinking I may – you know how you can rename Siri? I might
name her Ted.
Jenny:​ Oh my god.
Kristin:​ Ooh! Are you sure you’re gonna be able to handle that though?
Shannon:​ It’d be such a deep cut.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ Sick.
Shannon: ​I’d be like, hey Ted? I just want to see how long it’s gonna take
for somebody to notice that I named my Siri after the robot boyfriend.
Kristin:​ Somehow reprogram her to say “malarky” a bunch of times.
Shannon: ​“That’s malarky.” “I beg to differ, little lady” instead of “Sorry
what was that? I didn’t quite get that.” “I beg to differ, little lady.”
[laughter]
Kristin:​ Yeah, you turn the wrong way down a street, “I beg to differ –”
Shannon:​ God damn it!
Jenny:​ Yo, in the scene with the sticky buns –
Kristin:​ A great sentence already.
Jenny:​ Yeah. When –
Shannon:​ The Sticky B’s! [laughter] I gotta keep this as a theme.
Jenny:​ When Joyce is just like, letting Buffy know that she doesn’t believe
her and that her experience is not valid –
Kristin:​ Mm-hmm.


Jenny:​ I just want to point out that Joyce’s hair has softened into a thing
that we haven’t seen before.
Shannon:​ I noticed that, is it like a 50s thing?
Jenny:​ I think it’s like a 50s, 60s vibe.
Shannon:​ I think it was on purpose.
Kristin: ​Yeah, totally.
Shannon:​ I was noticing that and it kind of changed –
Jenny:​ That’s probably how Ted likes her hair. [grossed out noises]
Kristin:​ Good call. Ugh.
Shannon:​ ‘Cause the house was very 50s when we see it later.
Jenny:​ Oh yeah. Oh, hell yeah.
Shannon: ​I was wondering what was going on with the hair change. I was
like – and I actually was like, did they have a new hair person that episode?
They’re kind of just figuring out what they want to do or something?
Kristin:​ Yeah, that was a good call ‘cause I kind of noticed it but I didn’t
even connect it to the larger theme.
Shannon: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​So then we go to the high school and there’s a banner. I’m just
calling that out because we have talked a lot about how Sunnydale High
School fucking loves a banner.
Jenny:​ They just ​love ​a banner.
Shannon:​ They might be –


Kristin:​ This week is a pep rally.
Shannon: ​Oh, right, the signs in the background. Yeah. I saw that.
Kristin:​ Yeah, yeah. There’s just always – somebody’s making a banner,
hanging a banner.
Jenny:​ Oh! Were you gonna say maybe it’s hanging over something that
says Torrance High School?
Shannon:​ Yeah, I meant the one that says Sunnydale, like, the banner
outside. Like yeah, I wonder if it’s covering stuff like that.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Shannon:​ Like something practical
Kristin: ​I would love to know what is behind every banner in the series, you
know? Just rip it down.
Shannon:​ Also it’s the high school in 90210 too, right?
Jenny:​ Yeah!
Shannon:​ I think that they were just very aware of that too, maybe the
production designers, being like this is not 90210, this is a different school.
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ Totally. I have a personal question based on what we see happen
between Xander and Cordelia. So Xander complements Cordelia’s outfit and
Cordelia’s like, “the fuck are you doing, you idiot?” And then they want to
make out in the utility closet, which reminded me of My So Called Life.
Jenny:​ [Gasps]
Shannon: ​Oh yeah, I remember that, yeah.
Kristin:​ They used to always make out in the boiler room, right?


Shannon:​ Yeah!
Kristin:​ And I just thought, maybe it’s just me, but I didn’t make out
anywhere in any secret room in my high school.
Shannon:​ I didn’t make out with anyone in high school so I’m really the
wrong person –
Jenny:​ Me neither.
Kristin:​ That is a lie. You made out with people in high school.
Jenny:​ Well –
Kristin:​ But not in a secret room?
Jenny:​ No.
Kristin: ​Yeah. So it’s just like – but I kinda feel jealous about it.
Shannon:​ I literally never made out with anyone at school, ever. It didn’t
even happen the one time.
Kristin:​ No, I think I made out with –
Jenny:​ You know why? ‘Cause school is not a place for making out! Giles
and Jenny Calendar!
Shannon:​ [nerdy voice] It’s for studying and talking about Buffy the
Vampire Slayer at lunch.
Jenny: ​Yeah, fuck yeah!
Shannon:​ Just ask tiny little baby me. [laughter] And for wearing the
closest you could get to Sarah Michelle Gellar’s outfit that day.
Jenny:​ Yes exactly, it’s not for making out. Be you student or a teacher,
especially ​teacher​. Faculty, ugh!


Kristin: ​Yeah, Jenny – not Jenny Calendar but Jenny Owen Youngs was very
mad about Giles and Jenny Calendar making out in the school.
Shannon:​ It is unhinged behavior [Jenny laughs] and completely
unprofessional and really goes to my theory that it is a red flag.
Kristin:​ Right!?
Jenny:​ [whispers] Red flag.
Kristin: ​Ooh nice, Jenny. [laughs]
Jenny: ​There’s a great SNL sketch that you should totally check out called
Red Flag. Look it up. Enjoy.
Kristin:​ Oh, I didn’t know that. I just thought you were... it reminded me of
another SNL skit – whatever, continue. [laughter] I’m not gonna go down
this path.
Shannon: ​That’s a different podcast.
Kristin:​ It’s a different thing.
Jenny: ​A slippery slope. Uh, Buffy goes to Ted’s office.
Kristin:​ She does, mm-hmm.
Shannon:​ And doesn’t even sneak around.
Jenny: ​Doesn’t even sneak around. Doesn’t even wear her normal detective
outfit of trench coat and horrible sunglasses.
Shannon: ​She doesn’t even try to hide. She stands, like, right next to him
in the snack area.
Jenny:​ Right by the snack desk.
Shannon: ​And she’s just fully stood up, not concerned. She’s just like –


Jenny:​ Sort of leaning forward.
Kristin:​ Yeah, yeah. This is a whole thing, a very interesting thing. She sees
this picture folded in half, cutting Buffy out.
Jenny:​ The thing is, she knows that photo, it’s on her fridge at home. Why
does she have to take it out of the – I mean, I know it’s for us.
Kristin:​ It’s for us.
Jenny:​ I know, but I can’t –
Shannon:​ Production only took the one picture, so... [laughter] we didn’t
get around to doing a second picture, so we just have the one.
Kristin: ​But also why do you think – what’s the motivation for Ted to put
the picture – is the robot’s motivation to have the life he once had and he
just programed the robot wrong so that the robot’s really angry and kills the
wives every time? Like, I don’t understand why –
Jenny:​ We’ll never know.
Kristin: ​And why does he have a ​job​?
Shannon:​ Just because the patriarchy.
Kristin:​ Cool. Cool cool cool.
Shannon:​ He has the job to serve the story, that’s it.
Jenny:​ To serve the story but also maybe some sort of 50s man patriarchy
breadwinner thing.
Kristin:​ Ohhh-kay, yes.
Shannon:​ I just remembered that his conversation on the phone is like,
“It’s actually very expensive software.” [laughter] He’s talking about how
expensive the software is.


Kristin:​ God!
Shannon:​ Like that would be a pro. Like, “I’ve got this new software, it’s
quite expensive.” In 1997, being like, “She runs cheap software.”
Jenny:​ Just to the front of the episode when he’s talking computers with
Willow and he’s like “I bet you love your 9 gig hard drive” and she’s like “I
do!” You do?
Shannon:​ He gives her floppy disks later –
Kristin: ​Floppy disks!
Shannon:​ As an upgrade. [laughter]
Kristin:​ They’re like bundled together.
Shannon:​ He’s like, “Here’s the upgrade I talked to you about.” I was like,
that’s a disk.
Jenny:​ It was 5 floppy disks rubber-banded together.
Kristin: ​Cut to the scene that’s an hour long where Willow is just popping
out one disk and inserting the next disk [laughter].
Shannon: ​[as Willow] “I love these new disks, they’re massive”.
Jenny: ​Oh! Ted also has a job to pay for the rent on his weird, creepy
underground apartment which is below the Halloween store or the same
place the Halloween store was.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Shannon: ​Whatever is their weird room on their lot that is a swing set for
them.
Kristin:​ Yeah.


Shannon:​ They’re like, “today it’s an apartment.” I swear, it’s the store
later, but I think they use it as someone’s apartment at one point because I
remember that window.
Kristin:​ We’ll find out. We’ll let you know –
Shannon:​ I don’t want to spoil – yeah.
Kristin:​ When we see it again.
Shannon:​ Holler at me.
Kristin: ​We will let you know. So, Ted dies.
Shannon:​ Wait, what?
Kristin:​ Ted dies. It happens so quickly.
Jenny:​ After Buffy finds out that they’re gonna get married?
Kristin: ​Yeah, which is fucking weird. That whole thing is weird.
Jenny:​ [grossed out noises]
Kristin:​ But this scene where she comes back into her room –
Jenny: ​Ugh! Ugh!
Kristin:​ And he’s sitting there like a fucking creep-o, with her diary.
Jenny:​ No!
Shannon:​ And he literally says he gonna send her to a psych ward.
Kristin:​ Yes!
Shannon:​ It’s full on, classic “if you don’t do what I say, I’m gonna lock you
up in a psych ward.”


Kristin: ​Right!?
Shannon: ​“I’ll put you in jail.”
Kristin: ​He really went hard on –
Shannon: ​The patriarchy.
Kristin:​ The 1950s patriarchy. That brand of the patriarchy.
Shannon:​ And then when she gets upset, he punches her square in the
face!
Kristin:​ So hard.
Jenny:​ Without a warning shot.
Shannon:​ If she hadn’t been a vampire slayer, which was very lucky for Ted
in this moment –
Jenny: ​That her diary was true.
Shannon:​ She would have died because later, she gets slightly hit by Ted
and Joyce gets knocked out.
Kristin: ​No, Joyce is knocked out, yeah.
Shannon: ​She’s out for hours. Doesn’t remember a thing.
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Shannon:​ Is just like, “Whew, he was weird, huh?”
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Shannon:​ In the end she’s like, “That was weird.”
Kristin:​ Watching this episode, when we watched it for the first time, I don’t
know. I guess I just anticipated that he would get killed for the first time in


the end of the episode, so it really took me by surprise when we were 20
minutes in and Ted was dead at the bottom of the stairs. I was like, well
where’s this gonna go? [laughter] You know?
Shannon:​ It goes into SVU. It’s like, dun dun!
Jenny:​ Yeah.
Kristin:​ So then Giles packs his bag full of all of the weapons in Sunnydale
High School.
Shannon:​ In the smallest duffle bag.
Jenny: ​Hope the detectives don’t take a look in the Sunnydale library locker.
Shannon:​ He doesn’t even zip it up because sound was like, “Could you not
zip it? [laughter] It’s really disruptive”
Kristin:​ Yeah, he just walks out with his open duffle bag.
Shannon: ​Is that a giant crossbow in that tiny duffle bag?
Jenny:​ [as Giles] “No! No no no!”
Kristin: ​The crossbow, again jumping ahead – so last episode we saw
Kendra pick up the crossbow and be like “I know how to use this” and then
trigger it and shoot it accidentally. And the crossbow is up to no good once
again where Jenny Calendar accidentally shot Giles in the back.
Jenny:​ Let’s be real, as soon as Jenny Calendar picks up that crossbow, it is
apparent that she is ​not ​a person that should be holding a crossbow.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ She does not look centered?
Kristin:​ No.
Shannon:​ Would you call that a red flag, or no? [laughter] Just wondering.


Jenny: ​Is there a color past red?
Shannon: ​When she’s waving it wildly, as if she’s attempting to aim but it
looks like her eyes don’t work.
Jenny: ​[laughing] Yeah. She’s kinda dancing with it.
Shannon:​ It’s moving so much to where you’re like, “Are you aiming or
trying to learn the macarena?” [laughter] It is a lot. So naturally she shoots
him in the ​sacrum​.
Kristin:​ Yeah, she really gets him good.
Jenny:​ But how about Giles ripping an arrow out of himself?
Shannon: ​In the liver or kidney or something, like, in the back. He’s – I
can’t believe he lived. We never talk about that again.
Kristin:​ He does, though.
Jenny:​ Yeah, just another unanswered question from this episode.
Kristin:​ True. But he fucking yanks that thing right out of his own back.
Shannon: ​Ugh! And then they’re making out, like, two scenes later.
Kristin:​ Yeah, it’s a whole thing.
Shannon: ​I have issues.
Kristin:​ Oh god! Sorry, I just looked down at my – I have more notes but
the one that popped out at me was “Daddy’s here.”
Jenny:​ [loudly] Ew ew ew ew! Ew! Ew!
Kristin: ​I’m sorry. We’ll get there. We’re not there yet so I’m sorry because
we’re gonna have to say it again. Okay, we learn some stuff we should go


over before we get to daddy being here again. Bleh bleh bleh! There’s MDMA
or something in –?
Jenny:​ Listen! Suspension of disbelief. Willow is looking at a cookie under a
microscope! [laughter] What chemical compound does she see?
Shannon: ​It’s like Soylent Green or something, you know? [laughter] “It’s
people!” It’s all his old dead wives.
Kristin:​ Right! Oh, god – but right –
Shannon: ​“Does this pizza taste like dead wives to you?” And Xander’s like,
“Yes, it’s delicious.”
Jenny:​ Exactly!
Kristin:​ Xander loves dead wives. That’s on brand.
Shannon:​ It tastes amazing ‘cause the patriarchy.
Kristin:​ Yeah, because of the patriarchy. So yeah, they’re being drugged
but of course Buffy’s mad the whole time. So she’s the only one not
drugged. Ted is alive. Now we got to it. Now we got to “Daddy’s here.”
Shannon:​ Yeah. “Daddy’s here.”
Jenny:​ Gross!
Kristin:​ Disgusting.
Shannon: ​Mike P, is that you? You know, ‘cause – sorry, because the
Pences call each other Daddy and Mommy.
Jenny: ​[grossed out noises]
Shannon: ​It’s very strange.
Jenny: ​[continues making grossed out sounds]


Kristin:​ Oh, god, it’s like, “Daddy’s here” –
Shannon: ​Politics aside, guys, it is a crazy thing to do! [laughter] It. Is.
Weird.
Kristin:​ It’s just disgusting. “I don’t take orders from women, I wasn’t wired
that way.” Says Ted.
Jenny:​ Blegh. Great.
Kristin: ​And this is where – you know, Jenny, you’ve been talking about
Shannon being on this episode with us and getting into Ted’s robotics. And
this is really where, I think, you might wanna ask some questions.
Jenny: ​Yeah! I mean, if you were teching on this – if you were teching on
Ted, what would your moves be?
Shannon:​ Well, I mean, it depends. First of all, I don’t write the moves,
let’s not give me too much credit here. [laughter] But you know, it depends
on what his narrative is. Like, if he’s supposed to malfunction, if that’s part
of the experience for Buffy –
Kristin:​ Mmm.
Jenny: ​Right right.
Shannon:​ You know, maybe she was like “I really just always wanted to kill
a guy my mom wanted to pre-bone.” [laughter] So now it’s an experience
and she’s like “And I really wanted to have the cops be involved for the first
and only time, I think, ever in this series.” [laughter] “I want to feel some
weight of my – like, the consequences of my actions.” Maybe that’s her
theme park experience.
Kristin:​ Interesting.
Jenny:​ So everything’s going according to plan. No adjustments necessary.
Shannon:​ Yeah, just because frankly, I don’t want to gives notes on
whoever built Ted but why the hell are there so many lights in his cheek?


Kristin: ​[laughing] Yeah.
Shannon: ​When his skin comes off, it’s like, you don’t need those there,
man. What is going on there? [laughter]
Kristin:​ Yeah, his skin coming off is a real...
Shannon:​ Just a true waste of luminosity there.
Kristin:​ But I’ll tell you what, a waste in practicality, but effective in the
visual.
Jenny: ​Blegh.
Shannon: ​Yeah, they’re like, “It’s a robot!”
Kristin:​ Yeah. I’m a fan of the open-faced Ted.
Shannon: ​That’s an old model that responds to the radio signal in sector 3
of the park.
Jenny: ​Mm-hmm.
Kristin:​ “How about a nice game of Parcheesi?”
Jenny:​ No!
Shannon:​ Hard pass.
Kristin:​ I loved Parcheesi!
Jenny:​ Yeah, Parcheesi is fun, but not with Ted.
Shannon: ​Really?
Kristin: ​Yeah, you didn’t play Parcheesi? You weren’t a Parcheesi player?
Shannon: ​No.


Kristin: ​I loved it, I don’t know why. On face value, it seems like a pretty
boring game.
Shannon: ​By the way, I love a board game. I’d play anything. But I’ve
never played a Parcheesi.
Kristin:​ Parcheesi is like Sorry. Did you ever play Sorry?
Shannon: ​Oh yeah.
Kristin: ​I mean, it’s basically Sorry, but without... sorry.
Jenny:​ Without an apology?
Kristin:​ Yeah. It’s the non-apologist’s Sorry.
Shannon: ​It’s like un-co-dependent Sorry. Sorry, I’m sorry. Sorry, sorry,
sorry [laughter] What if we made a game and we just called it “Sorry?” The
women will always win. “Sorry sorry sorry sorry.” [laughter]
Kristin: ​Yep.
Jenny:​ Speaking of women... you know that thing where sometimes in a
young girl’s life, you just have four dead wives in your closet?
Kristin: ​For safe keeping.
Jenny:​ And you can only tell by looking, not by smelling, but we don’t know
how – like, are they –
Shannon: ​Yeah, it never smells bad. It’s clearly clean skeletons.
Jenny:​ Kristin said, “I picture them in jars.” I was thinking maybe they were
skeletons.
Shannon:​ And I said those jars, first of all, where do you get giant industrial
translucent jars? [laughter] That Xander can clearly see through. But also...
how do you get all the flesh off the bones so quickly? I mean, unless that


robot is from the 50s. Maybe the robot has been doing this since the 50s? Is
he a 50s robot?
Kristin:​ Right? That’s the impression I got.
Jenny:​ No clear answers.
Kristin:​ Where does he get the body? You know what I mean? Because
when we saw “I Robot, You Jane,” is that the one where they build a robot –
they’re building a robot body?
Jenny: ​Mm-hm.
Kristin: ​It would make sense ‘cause it’s called “I Robot, You Jane” but I just
wanted to make sure. They need the bodies to make them alive again.
Shannon:​ Right.
Kristin: ​So you would think that you would need a casing, right? It’s...
Shannon:​ ‘Cause the 3D printers haven’t been invented yet –
Kristin: ​Exactly.
Shannon:​ In 1997, though androids have. The biggest problem is the skin.
Kristin:​ Precisely.
Shannon: ​Yeah. I mean, artificial intelligence is already here in 1997. Just
no skin, which is hard.
Kristin:​ Right. But yeah, this episode... is a weird episode.
Shannon:​ There’s a lot of suspension of disbelief, more so than we’re used
to.
Kristin:​ Yes.


Shannon:​ There’s a lot of world expanding here. They really kind of go out
on a limb, but I like the limb. It’s just a very strange... there’s a lot of – it
just is happening. Like, the cops must’ve decided to drop the charges on
Buffy when he gets off the table. The autopsy table.
Kristin: ​Right? They’re like, “Well, the guy’s gone, so I guess we’ll – the
body is not in the morgue anymore, so…” There’s a bunch of stuff –
Shannon:​ There’s a lot of, like, “it doesn’t matter for the story, so let’s just
move on.”
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Shannon: ​And it’s all – it’s definitely the right – it’s just crazy.
Kristin: ​It seems like one of the most important – I mean, I think one of the
most important pieces of this episode is us looking at Buffy respond to
harming a person. Even though we find out in the end that Ted was a robot.
That’s, I think, the realest piece of it, is that she’s like “No, I killed someone.
I used my strength against a human.” And we haven’t really seen that ever
happen before.
Shannon: ​Yeah, I actually thought it was interesting that they decided not
to go there deeper. That she doesn’t question her power or be like, “I’m not
doing this anymore –”
Jenny: ​Mmm.
Shannon:​ “I don’t want to be a violent person anymore.” I mean, I’m sure
there was that idea in the room and they were like, that’s not where we’re
going with this, Buffy should never question her being a vampire slayer.
Kristin:​ Right.
Shannon:​ But it did surprise me that she’s just kind of sad.
Kristin:​ Yeah.


Shannon:​ She’s just sad that her mom’s sad. But she’s not like, “I gotta
look myself in the mirror.” It definitely – that doesn’t exist in it, which is
weird.
Kristin: ​Yeah, there’s not as much introspection as you would think. As
we’ve seen in past episodes.
Shannon:​ There’s just not time in it for where the story’s going, but yeah, it
surprised me. On a rewatch.
Jenny:​ There wasn’t even enough time to explain half of the things that
happened in the episode.
Shannon:​ Yeah, exactly.
Kristin: ​Yeah. Ted. That’s it. That’s all I’ve got.
Shannon:​ Wait, I actually have one more thing. Remember when they go to
his house and it’s, like, in the hatch? Down the hatch?
Kristin and Jenny: ​Yeah yeah yeah.
Shannon: ​How the hell did they get all that furniture down there? The hatch
is barely the size of a person! [laughter]
Kristin: ​Oh yeah!
Shannon: ​There’s no exterior door. The first time we see that couch, I was
like, how’d they get the couch through that hatch? [laughter] Did they build
it around – wait, what’s happening here?
Kristin: ​Yeah, and it’s almost made to seem like the building was built
around that underground department, you know?
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin:​ And we only found that, thanks to Cordelia. I just want to point that
out.


Jenny: ​It’s like, does the rug not go with the decor or is there no decor to
speak of?
Kristin:​ Well, that’s what she means. She means...
Jenny:​ Maybe.
Kristin: ​I’m a Cordelia apologist.
Jenny: ​Uh-huh.
Shannon:​ Sorry sorry sorry sorry. [laughter]
Kristin: ​I mean, I was kinda into the apartment, I’m not gonna lie. I kinda
like the 50s vibe going on down there.
Jenny:​ You want to get an underground, no windows place?
Kristin:​ Yeah! With four dead wives in the closet.
Jenny: ​Mmm.
Shannon: ​See you guys never! [laughter]
Kristin:​ You won’t come over to do the podcast anymore when we move to
our bunker?
Shannon:​ Oh okay, that’s alright. I’m okay. I’m gonna stay in, I gotta wash
my hair.
Jenny: ​Uh-huh, yes.
Shannon: ​Can I just talk about the second to last thing that Ted says –
Kristin:​ Please.
Shannon: ​Is [impersonates Ted] “Want a little gravy with that?!” [laughter]
His malfunctioning asides are so great. It’s such a – I wish that this was – I
wish I had read this as a comic book.


Kristin: ​Mmm.
Shannon:​ This episode is a perfect comic book.
Jenny: ​Uh-huh.
Shannon: ​It really is, but those bits. Like, [Ted impression] “Want a little
gravy with that?” I’m really just sad that, you know, I never made that joke
at work on Westworld. And then also sad for myself ‘cause if I had, no one
would have gotten it. I would have been like, [nerd voice] “That’s what John
Ritter says when he malfunctions.” People would be like, “Take Shannon
back to her cage.” [laughter]
Kristin: ​Not to keep bringing it back to this full circle but I really can’t get
over the brilliance of you, having at age 13 called this the Westworld
episode. And having known that, like, how did you know?
Shannon: ​Well, my dad’s a software designer and we watched all kinds of
sci-fi.
Kristin:​ Was your dad Ted?!
Jenny: ​[simultaneously] Is your dad a robot!?
Shannon: ​My dad is... Ted.
Kristin: ​Complicated.
Shannon:​ He worked for IBM, actually. But yeah, he showed me the movie.
We watched all kinds of stuff like that. We watched The X-Files. All the books
that he gave me to read when I was like, “I want to read grown-up books”
when I was in 5th, 6th grade. Whenever you start asking about stuff like
that, they were all Michael Crichton books.
Jenny:​ Hell yeah.
Shannon: ​The first grown-up book I read was The Andromeda Strain.


Kristin:​ Wow.
Shannon: ​It wasn’t weird to me that I knew these movies. It was weirder to
me that that’s not what other people’s dads were showing them. My dad’s
very young too. But yeah, Westworld. It is really the Westworld Buffy
episode, truly.
Kristin:​ Truly.
Jenny:​ The most.
Shannon:​ He’s the Yul Brynner. What if Buffy’s mom dated the
malfunctioning robot from Westworld?
Kristin:​ What if there was a slayer in Westworld, what would happen?
Shannon:​ Also if I would’ve been old enough to really appreciate, by the
way, what Westworld was as a genre movie – it really was such an awesome
movie way before it’s time. I would’ve, I think, had much more of an affinity
for this episode. And I think that’s why Joss… Joss wrote this episode. There
really is a great – it’s really cool.
Kristin: ​Yeah.
Shannon: ​It just doesn’t fit in the world the way… it feels like it’s a passion
project.
Jenny: ​Right.
Shannon:​ And I like that.
Kristin:​ Which is kind of amazing. I mean, I like that view of it too, is that
you have the ability to take these stories in different directions and explore
things and have fun with them.
Shannon: ​Yeah, it’s like, I’d want to make the Beetlejuice episode, you
know what I mean? I do get it.
Kristin: ​Totally! Well.


Jenny:​ Well.
Shannon: ​This was fun.
Kristin:​ This was the best.
Jenny: ​It’s been fantastic!
Shannon: ​Guys, thanks for having me. It’s been a treat.
Jenny: ​Thanks for being with us.
Kristin:​ Thank you, you are always welcome here if you’d like to talk about
any other episodes. They do not need to always include robots.
Shannon:​ Okay. Thank you so much for saying that. [laughter] Sorry sorry
sorry sorry sorry.
Kristin: ​I’m so sorry.
Jenny:​ Everyone who’s listening, you’ve already seen Season 1 of
Westworld but go back and watch it a second time, please.
Kristin: ​It really merits at least a second viewing, if not a third.
Jenny: ​Yeah.
Kristin: ​It’s a show that I think really gets better with additional viewings,
yeah.
Jenny: ​It improves with multiple viewings. Hell yeah. Shannon, where can
people find you on the internet if they just want to absorb your social media
presence?
Shannon:​ I’m @shannonwoodward on the twitter. It’s 90% politics, 10%
jokes. So just warning you. Don’t –
Kristin:​ A lot of smashing the patriarchy happening over there.


Shannon: ​Yeah, there’s definitely a lot of that, yeah.
Jenny:​ Oh, hell yeah!
Shannon: ​I like to slay trolls. Much like Buffy slays vampires. [laughter]
Jenny: ​Yeah, you go hard on the trolls.
Shannon:​ Listen, sometimes you gotta teach the teenage kids how to deal
with bullies. And I think to some extent, it’s the only reason why I keep
doing it. You just gotta hang people with their own dumb, hateful words.
Kristin:​ Mm-hmm.
Shannon:​ You know, like, I’m not mean to them, I just let them hang in
public.
Kristin: ​Yep.
Shannon: ​And you know, it’s kind of the best way to deal with a bully. A lot
of kids write at me sometimes and they say, like, they learn how to talk to
people in a certain way. As annoying as it is, I truly keep doing it because of
those kids.
Kristin: ​Yeah.
Shannon:​ And because I slightly enjoy it. But you know.
Kristin:​ So follow Shannon Woodward on twitter.
Jenny: ​Yeah, thanks for making the world a better place in a variety of
ways.
Shannon: ​Oh, thanks, guys!
Kristin:​ Yeah. Wait, Shannon can you talk about… ‘cause you work with
some really awesome projects too, that are lifting women up.


Shannon: ​Oh yeah, I’m also part of a women’s reproductive health
organization called A is For. And you can follow us on @aisfororg on twitter
or aisfor.org. We basically – we raise money for various women’s
reproductive health organizations, some of them smaller and we give them
direct donations. All kinds of really interesting women’s health. People who
provide law services for pregnant teens or – you know all kinds of things like
that. Anyway, if you’re interested in that, please check us out.
Kristin:​ Yeah.
Jenny:​ Hell yeah.
Kristin:​ Very important stuff.
Shannon:​ Thanks.
Kristin:​ Thank you for doing that too.
Shannon: ​Aw, thanks
Jenny:​ Listeners, thanks so much for listening! I’m Jenny Owen Youngs and
when I’m not watching Buffy I’m making music. You can learn more about
me and listen to some of those songs at
www.jennyowenyoungs.com/buffering and you can give me a shout at
Twitter @jennyowenyoungs.
Kristin: ​And I’m Kristin Russo you can find me on twitter @kristinnoeline
[she spells it out]. You can also learn about the work that I do with LGBTQ
communities, as well as their families and educators over on my website
www.kristinnoeline.com. Those organizations that I run are Everyone is Gay
and My Kid is Gay. And just so you know, something that I don’t talk about
often, is that I also wrote a book. It’s called This is a Book for Parents of Gay
Kids. And I don’t know if you know what it’s about, but it is a book that is a
Q&A guide for parents, family members, educators, anyone really who is in
the orbit of any LGBTQ person. It tackles sexuality, gender, coming out, all
of those things. It’s very useful and you probably know someone who could
use it. [whispers] It might be you.
Jenny:​ It’s a great book.

[Jenny performing “Ted” off the album “Songs from Season Two” by
Buffering the Vampire Slayer]
Here lies Ted
Ted is dead
May he rest
In little pieces
Scraps all heaped up
In little pieces to the sky
Here lies Ted
No tears shed
He always said
You take no malarky
And he had no heartbeat


In his chest
Here lies Ted
The evidence
Of four ex-wives
Found in a closet
In his apartment
Underground
[whistling]
Here lies Ted
May he rest
In deep distress
And never call me
Little lady
Ever again
Jenny:​ Oh hey guys, you’re still here. During the editing phase of this
episode we realized that we neglected to give out a Sexual Tension Award.
Kristin: ​[gasps]
Jenny:​ How embarrassing.
Kristin: ​How embarrassing.
Jenny:​ But don’t worry!
Kristin:​ Don’t worry, we’re still here!
Jenny:​ And we still have an award.
Kristin: ​We thought maybe it could go to Buffy and Angel, they had that
whole hand wrap scene.
Jenny: ​Meh
Kristin: ​But really


Jenny:​ We know where the tension is!
Kristin:​ We know where the tension is and it’s between Xander and that
damn pizza.
Jenny: ​Yeah Xander and the mini pizzas.
Kristin: ​Yeah
Jenny:​ A tale as old as time.
Kristin:​ Mhm
Jenny:​ Sometimes you just lock eyes with someone, or some pizza across
the room [laughter] and you just know that they’re the one.
Kristin: ​There was this beautiful ad in Brooklyn at this pizzeria I used to
walk by all the time that was just a lady holding a pizza. She was holding it
two inches above her head. It was like she took the bite with the pizza
parallel to her mouth and then raised the pizza up a couple inches so that
the cheese was pulling down.
Jenny: ​What a weird…
Kristin: ​She was making out with the pizza is what I’m trying to say.
Jenny: ​Ohhh! So you’re no stranger to sexual tension between a person and
pizza
Kristin:​ I’m no stranger and the poster is definitely from the 1980’s so what
I’d also like to say is Xander is not the first person to have sexual tension
with pizza.
Jenny:​ No, he’s not the pioneer. The pizza love pioneer.
Kristin: Huh-uh. There were many that came before him. Xander and the
pizza—


Jenny:​ Congratulations!
Kristin:​— congratulations to you both.
Jenny: ​Bye
